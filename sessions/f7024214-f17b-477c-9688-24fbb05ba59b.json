However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell\npools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell\nproliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human\nadipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres\nin a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 µm) and cultured using a\nwave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased\nthe proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers),\nrespectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels\nof pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for\nproliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We\nbelieve that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.\nKeywords: adipose-derived stem cell; microgravity culture; polystyrene microsphere; collagen\nmicrosphere; multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cell\n1. Introduction\nHuman adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are easily isolated therapeutic stem cells\nfrom adipose tissue. They have increasingly been used to ameliorate a broad range of\nrefractory diseases, including irradiated tissue [1], ischemic wounds [2], and diabetic\nulcers [3]. However, their clinical efﬁcacy has been limited because the long-term survival\nof transplanted hASCs is diminished by environmental stress [4–6]. Consequently, hASC\ntherapeutic mechanisms have been limited to the secretion of cytokines and growth factors\nto promote cell recruitment, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and\nangiogenesis [7–10]. In contrast, embryonic stem cells retain their potency and are thought\nto be superior to adult stem cells for regenerative potential [11]. However, the use of\nembryonic stem cells is limited by ethical issues [12].\nModern research has made gains toward a better understanding of stem-cell hetero-\ngeneity [13,14]. Within stem-cell pools (previously thought to be homogenous), a surprising\ndegree of subpopulation dynamics in gene expression has been revealed related to tissue\nregeneration, cell survival, proliferation, and stemness [15]. This concept of functional\nindividuality within a stem-cell pool is especially important for hASCs, because cells with\nhigher functional properties would be expected to have more promising therapeutic bene-\nﬁts through an increased capacity to survive under difﬁcult conditions, to differentiate into\nvarious mesenchymal cell types, and to home into damaged tissues [16–18]. One example\nCells 2021, 10, 560. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10030560\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n2 of 18\nof a highly functional hASC candidate is the multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring\n(Muse) cell, which can be isolated from hASCs using its expression of stage-speciﬁc em-\nbryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3) [19] and has been reported to have novel potential for liver\ncirrhosis [20], brain infarction [21], and aortic aneurysm [22] treatments.\nAn additional problem is that the expansion of such highly-pluripotent cell popu-\nlations is quite difﬁcult. Adhesion-based cultures, the standard technique for in vitro\nexpansion of hASCs, are known to lead to a gradual quiescence in stemness indicated,\nfor example, by a decline in CD34 positivity [23]. In contrast, suspension-type cultures\nhave also been used successfully for temporary cultivations of Muse cells, and although\nthe mechanism is unknown, it has been reported that a microgravity (i.e., weightless)\nenvironment had a positive effect on stem-cell cultures for maintenance of their original\npotencies [24]. However, the forced-ﬂoating of hASC cultures using non-adherent dishes\ncaused spherical aggregations and oxygen/nutrient diffusion limits, which resulted in\ncentral necrosis in hASC spheroids [25]. There is, therefore, an urgent need for new and ad-\nvanced culture techniques to permit the selective expansion of hASC subpopulations with\nimproved properties for proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, immunosuppression,\nand stress-resistance.\nThe microcarrier system was ﬁrst introduced in 1967 for the growth of ﬁbroblasts [26],\nand has been used for the expansion of other adherent cells such as chondrocytes [27],\nhepatocytes [28], neural stem cells [29], and hASCs [30,31]. Microcarriers are usually\nsmall spherical particles which can adhere to cultivated cells and are characterized by\nhigher surface-to-volume ratios that can accommodate higher cell densities compared\nto monolayer cultures. Most importantly, under the dynamic conditions of continuous\nshaking, microcarrier culturing has a multidirectional gravity effect on the adhered cells,\neffectively mimicking ﬂoating cultures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate\nthe ability of dynamic microgravity culturing of hASCs using microcarriers to selectively\nexpand highly functional stem-cell subpopulations.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Primary Culture of hASCs\nHuman lipoaspirates were obtained from 12 healthy female donors, average age\n42.2 ± 9.3 years (mean ± SD) and average body mass index of 22.4 ± 1.8 kg/m2, who\nunderwent abdominal liposuction. Each patient provided written informed consent, and\nthe research protocol was approved by the institutional review board. The stromal vascular\nfraction (SVF) was isolated from the lipoaspirates as described previously [23]. Brieﬂy,\naspirated fat tissue was digested using 0.075% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,\nOsaka, Japan) at 37 ◦C for 30 min on a shaker. After centrifugation (800× g for 10 min),\nSVF cells were obtained as cellular pellets, ﬁltered through 100, 70, and 40 µm mesh, and\nresuspended. The SVF cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 nucleated cells/100 mm\ndish and cultured at 37 ◦C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in humid air. Cells\nwere grown in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium with Ham’s F-12 (DMEM/F12; Wako\nPure Chemical Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cells were\ncultured until near conﬂuence. Then, the adherent cells were released using a proteolytic\nenzyme treatment (TrypLE Express, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), deﬁned as passage\n0 (P0) hASCs, and transferred to another dish. Once the adherent hASCs reached 80%\nconﬂuency, cells were passaged using TrypLE Express, and P3 hASCs were used in the\nfollowing experiments. Using a multicolor ﬂow cytometer (MACS-Quant, Miltenyi Biotec,\nBergisch Gladbach, Germany), P3 hASCs were characterized for the positive expressions of\nCD73, CD90, and CD105 and the negative expression of CD45 before use.\n2.2. Characterization of SSEA-3-Positive Cells in the hASC Pool\nFirst, SSEA-3 marker expression was assessed in normal hASCs using ﬂow cytometry.\nAdherent P3 hASCs from each donor were detached using TrypLE Express, centrifuged,\nand washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were sieved through 100\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n3 of 18\nand 40 µm mesh ﬁlters, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended for analysis.\nThe isolated cells were incubated with rat anti-SSEA-3 antibody (1:50; BioLegend, San\nDiego, CA, USA) and detected using an ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat\nIgM (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using a multicolor\nﬂow cytometer (MACS-Quant). Control gates were set based on staining with a labeled\nnon-speciﬁc antibody (matched isotype control immunoglobulin G (IgG)); no more than\n0.1% of the cells were deemed positive using the non-speciﬁc antibody.\nTo assess the stress durability of SSEA-3-positive cells, adherent P3 hASCs were ex-\nposed to a variety of optimized stress conditions (heat, 45 ◦C for 1 min; low-pH solution\n(pH = 5) for 60 min; proteolysis, TrypLE Express for 20 h at 37 ◦C; hypotonia, Milli-Q\nwater for 1 min; and mechanostress, transferred 30 times between two syringes through\na connector with a small hole). One day after stress exposure, cell numbers and viability\nwere measured using a dual-ﬂuorescence automated cell counter (Luna-FL, Logos Biosys-\ntems, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), and SSEA-3 positivity was detected by ﬂow cytometry after\ngating dead cells from live cells using 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD, BD Biosciences)\nﬂuorescence (n = 12).\n2.3. Preparation of Microspheres\nTwo kinds of microspheres were used as cell carriers during cell culture. First, crosslinked\npolystyrene microspheres (Polystyrene Beads Large, Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA)\nwith diameters between 200−300 µm were used. For good cell attachment, the polystyrene\nsurfaces were hydrophilized using a 30 min plasma treatment from a vacuum plasma\napparatus (YHS-DϕS, Sakigake-Semiconductor, Kyoto, Japan). Ten grams of polystyrene\nmicrospheres (approximately 2.4 million microbeads with a total surface area of 4000 cm2)\nwere washed three times in 70% ethanol for sterilization and diluted in 15 mL of PBS.\nSecondly, collagen microspheres (100−200 µm diameters, Cellagen; Koken, Tokyo, Japan)\nmanufactured from reconstituted collagen obtained from bovine skin and crosslinked\nwith 0.5% hexamethylene diisocyanate were used. Pre-sterilized vials (15 mL) contained\napproximately three million collagen beads with a total surface area of approximately\n4000 cm2.\n2.4. hASC Loading onto Microspheres for Microgravity Culture\nThe two types of microspheres were washed with PBS and resuspended in warm\nculture medium overnight (DMEM/F12) prior to use. Polystyrene and collagen micro-\nsphere solutions (0.3 mL), representing a total surface area of approximately 80 cm2, were\nadded to 3.5 cm diameter, non-adherent, polystyrene dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY,\nUSA). The dishes were placed onto a continuous-action shaker (Wave-PR, Taitec, Saitama,\nJapan), capable of shaking the microspheres in three dimensions by combining movements\nfrom two axes (rotary and seesaw). As a result, the cumulative gravity vector toward the\nmicrospheres was minimized towards zero (i.e., microgravity). The unit was driven by a\ncomputer system which allowed for the adjustment of rotation speed and shaking angle\n(see Video S1).\nFor each dish on the shaker, 1 × 105 P3 hASCs were suspended in 300 µL of DMEM/F12\nand incubated at 37 ◦C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in humid air. After allowing\nthe mixture of cells and microcarriers to settle for 30 min, 2 min of shaking was started at a\nsetting of 10 rpm and a shaking angle of 6 degrees, and then stopped for a further 28 min.\nThis 30 min procedure was repeated eight times (4 h total) to allow the cells to adhere to the\nmicrospheres circumferentially. Then, DMEM/F12 was added (1.5 mL) and the suspension\nwas stirred continuously at 15 rpm at a 6◦shaking angle. Using this continuous stirring,\nthe cells experienced a microgravity environment while being strongly attached to the\nmicrospheres. Culturing continued for up to two weeks, and the culture medium was\nchanged twice per week as follows; after allowing the microspheres to settle, half of the\nsupernatant was exchanged for fresh medium.\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n4 of 18\n2.5. Cell Retrieval from Microspheres\nWhen ready for analysis, the cell–microcarrier complexes obtained from the culture\ndishes were transferred to new tubes (15 mL) and sedimented. For each tube, the super-\nnatant was removed, and the complexes were washed using PBS. Cells were enzymatically\nreleased by incubation with 5 mL of TrypLE Express for 15 min at 37 ◦C. Cell suspensions\nwere diluted with additional culture medium (5 mL) and sieved through 100 and 40 µm\nmesh collector screens. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600× g for 5 min, and then\nresuspended for analysis. No microcarriers (fractured or intact) were seen in the retrieved\ncell suspensions.\n2.6. Cell Growth in Microsphere Cultures\nNumerical measurement of viable cells cultured on polystyrene and collagen micro-\nspheres, or in polystyrene and collagen dishes was carried out using a dual-ﬂuorescence\nautomated cell counter (Luna-FL). P3 hASCs (1 × 105) were seeded onto polystyrene and\ncollagen microspheres under dynamic conditions, or onto polystyrene and collagen dishes\nas static monolayer cultures. The cells were retrieved by trypsinization and counted on\ndays 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14, and growth rates were calculated (i.e., hASC growth rate = hASC\nnumber on day 7/day 1). Data were gathered from six separate samples. Visualizations of\nhASCs cultured on polystyrene and collagen microspheres were carried out on day 7 using\na light microscope (Leica DM-LB, Wetzlar, Germany) and a scanning electron microscope\n(SEM; S-3500N, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at a beam energy of 25 kV. For the observing the\ncollagen microspheres, a cryo-SEM technique at −130 ◦C was used so as not to scatter and\nlose uncharged microspheres.\n2.7. Proliferation of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs in Microsphere Cultures\nTo determine whether microsphere culturing and/or dynamic conditions enhanced\nthe proliferation of highly functional hASCs, we assessed cell number, viability, and SSEA-\n3-positivity using ﬂow cytometry in six groups: hASCs retrieved from either polystyrene or\ncollagen microcarriers under dynamic conditions, those retrieved from either polystyrene or\ncollagen microcarriers under static conditions, and those retrieved from either polystyrene\nor collagen dishes. The number of SSEA-3(+) cells was measured after seven days of\nculture under each condition, and growth rates were calculated (i.e., SSEA-3(+) growth\nrate = SSEA-3(+) cell number on day 7/day 0). Six separate samples were used for the\ndata analysis.\n2.8. Immunocytochemistry\nP3 hASCs were cultured for seven days on polystyrene or collagen microspheres, and\nin polystyrene or collagen dishes, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and\npermeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were\nincubated for 16 h (4 ◦C) with the following primary antibodies: anti-OCT4 (GeneTex,\nIrvine, CA, USA); anti-SOX2 (GeneTex); anti-NANOG (N3C3, GeneTex); and anti-SSEA-3\n(EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). All primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in a\nsolution of PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin. Appropriate secondary antibodies (1:200\ndilutions of either goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594, goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor\n488, or goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594) were incubated with cells for 1 h at room temperature.\nFinally, cells were washed with PBS and treated with Hoechst 33342 (1:500; Dojindo,\nKumamoto, Japan) for 10 min. Stained cells were visualized as 30 µm Z-stack ﬂuorescence\nimages collected in 1.5 µm steps taken by a ﬂuorescence-equipped microscope (Keyence,\nOsaka, Japan).\n2.9. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated from hASCs cultured with either polystyrene or collagen\nmicrospheres under dynamic conditions, polystyrene or collagen microspheres under static\nconditions, and from those cultured on normal polystyrene dishes (control) for seven days\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n5 of 18\nusing an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by reverse transcription.\nRT-PCR was performed using a StepOnePlus RT-PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,\nWaltham, MA, USA) using a fast SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)\nand the primers listed in Table 1. Expression levels were calculated by a comparative CT\nmethod relative to a common endogenous reference gene, ACTB. Data were taken from\nthree separate samples.\nTable 1.

Colony-Forming Assay\nP3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under\ndynamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then seeded (1 × 102 cells)\ninto polystyrene 6-well plates. Cells were incubated at 37 ◦C for ten days, ﬁxed with\nmethanol, stained with cresyl violet solution, and then counted using digital imaging\nsoftware (Photoshop; Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) (n = 6).\n2.11. In Vitro Angiogenesis (Network Formation) Assay\nP3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under\ndynamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then cell-network for-\nmation was assessed. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was applied to 96-well plates (50 µL per\nwell) and polymerized (30 min at 37 ◦C). After incubation in endothelial basal medium\n(EBM; Cambrex, Walkersville, MD, USA) containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h as\na pretreatment, 5000 cells (resuspended in 50 µL of EBM) were plated into the Matrigel\nwells and cultured for 6 h. Branch formation was observed with phase microscopy, and the\nlengths of cytoplasmic extensions per ﬁeld were calculated (n = 6).\n2.12. Multilineage Differentiation Assay\nP3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under dy-\nnamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then differentiated into adi-\npogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages (n = 3). Cells were seeded into polystyrene\n6-well plates and incubated in DMEM/F12 until conﬂuent. Adipogenic/osteogenic differ-\nentiation was initiated using either adipogenic medium (Adipolife; Lifeline Cell Technology,\nFrederick, MD, USA) or osteogenic medium (Osteolife; Lifeline Cell Technology). After\nculturing for 21 days (medium changed every three days), adipogenic ability was analyzed\nqualitatively with oil red O staining and quantitatively with AdipoRed reagent (Lonza,\nBasel, Switzerland). Osteogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively using von Kossa staining\nand quantitatively by Calcium-E testing (Wako Pure Chemicals). Chondrogenic differen-\ntiation was conducted using a micromass culture system; hASCs were resuspended in\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n6 of 18\nchondrogenic medium (Chondrolife; Lifeline Cell Technology) and centrifuged (800× g\nfor 5 min). Half of the medium was changed after centrifugation every two days. After\ntwo weeks, chondrogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively using Alcian blue staining and\nquantitatively by measuring micromass diameters.\n2.13. Statistics\nData were analyzed using SPSS package 23.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and\nKyplot 2.0 (Freeware). Based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, the data were normally dis-\ntributed within the donor populations. Therefore, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nand Bonferroni adjustments for post-hoc comparisons were used to determine signiﬁcant\ndifferences between means (p < 0.05 representing signiﬁcance, unless otherwise stated).\n3. Results\n3.1. Characterization of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs\nCells were expanded for three passages before characterization using ﬂow cytometry\nand combinations of mesenchymal-cell surface markers. We found that 94.9 ± 3.3% of\ncells were positive for CD105, CD90, and CD73, and that 99.5 ± 0.3% were negative for\nCD45. Then, the total number of cells, their viability, and SSEA-3-positivity of viable cells\nwere assessed in normal hASCs (control) and in ﬁve kinds of stress-treated hASCs. One\nday after stress exposure, even though all stressed groups showed signiﬁcant reductions\n(62.4–74.2%) in viable cells compared to the control group, stressed cells exhibited higher\nproportions of SSEA-3(+) cells (heat, 2.1%; low pH, 3.1%; proteolysis, 4.2%; hypotonia, 2.2%;\nmechanostress, 1.4%) compared to controls (1.3%) (Figure 1A). No signiﬁcant differences\nwere detected in the overall numbers of SSEA-3(+) cells between stress-treated hASCs\nand normal hASCs, with the exception of the mechanostress group, which showed a\nsigniﬁcantly lower number of SSEA-3(+) cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 1B,C).\n3.2. Cell Growth in Microgravity Microsphere Cultures\nAdherent cells are continuously affected by the downward force of gravity throughout\nthe culture period, but cells attached to continuously stirred microspheres are affected by\nmultidirectional gravitational forces (i.e., microgravity) (Figure 2A). The numbers of hASCs\nwere decreased in both polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures on day 1, suggesting\nthat some cells did not successfully adhere to the microbeads (Figure 2B). However, the\ngrowth rates (i.e., hASC number on day 7/day 1) used to estimate true cell proliferation\nshowed no signiﬁcant differences between groups (polystyrene microsphere, 6.0; collagen\nmicrosphere, 6.0; polystyrene dish, 5.7; collagen dish, 5.8). On day 14, there were no\nsigniﬁcant differences in the numbers of hASCs retrieved from each culture, possibly\nbecause the monolayer cultures reached conﬂuency. Visualizations of hASCs that were\nadhered to polystyrene and collagen microspheres at culture-day 7 revealed their successful\nproliferation (Figure 2C).\n3.3. Proliferation of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs in Microgravity/Microsphere Cultures\nAs described above, the numbers of viable hASCs on day 7 were lower in the\nmicrosphere-cultured groups, regardless of the material (polystyrene or collagen) or the\ncondition (dynamic or static), compared to the dish-cultured groups (Figure 3A). However,\nwhen compared to polystyrene monolayer cultures (as controls), the static-condition\npolystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures produced 2.3-fold and 2.2-fold propor-\ntional increases, and 1.2-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the numbers of SSEA-3(+) hASCs,\nrespectively (p < 0.05 for both). In addition, the dynamic-culture conditions produced\n4.4-fold and 4.3-fold proportional increases, and 2.7-fold and 2.9-fold increases in the\nnumbers of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to the dish cultures, respectively (p < 0.001 for\nboth) (Figure 3B,C). These results indicate positive effects for both the microsphere and\nmicrogravity conditions on SSEA-3(+) cell proliferation and on SSEA-3(+) cell growth rates\n(i.e., growth rate = SSEA-3(+) cell number on day 7/day 0) Table 2.\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n7 of 18\nFigure 1.

Selected Gene Expression Analysis by RT-PCR\nWe used RT-PCR to compare the expression of several genes involved with stemness\nand mesenchymal differentiation in hASCs from microgravity/microsphere cultures to\ntheir expressions in hASCs from dish cultures (n = 3). The hASCs cultured with polystyrene\nmicrospheres under dynamic conditions exhibited signiﬁcantly upregulated OCT4, SOX2,\nKLF4, and CD34 expressions, while hASCs cultured with collagen microspheres under\ndynamic conditions showed up-regulations of SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF4, and CD34 ex-\npressions (Figure 5). In contrast, hASCs from microsphere cultures under static conditions\n(both polystyrene and collagen) displayed no statistically signiﬁcant differences for all the\ngenes examined.\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n10 of 18\n \nFigure 4.

We found a signiﬁcantly higher number of\ncolonies in the polystyrene microsphere group (p = 0.027) and in the collagen microsphere\ngroup (p = 0.025) compared to the polystyrene dish group (n = 6) (Figure 6).\nFigure 6.

In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay\nThe network-formation assay showed that hASCs cultured with polystyrene and col-\nlagen microspheres formed complex, capillary-like networks more quickly and intricately\nthan dish-cultured hASCs (Figure 7A). Accordingly, the lengths of cytoplasmic extensions\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n12 of 18\nwere also signiﬁcantly longer in the polystyrene- and collagen-microsphere groups com-\npared to the dish group (p < 0.001), whereas the microsphere material (polystyrene or\ncollagen) had no signiﬁcant effect (Figure 7B).\n \nFigure 7.

Multilineage Differentiation Assay\nBased on lineage-speciﬁc differentiations, hASCs that were cultured on polystyrene\nand collagen microspheres displayed higher levels of adipogenic and osteogenic differenti-\nation compared to hASCs cultured in polystyrene dishes (controls) using intracellular lipid\ncontent (adipogenic) and calcium deposition (osteogenic) assessments (Figure 8). However,\nwhile hASCs cultured on collagen microspheres did display higher levels of chondro-\ngenic differentiation compared to controls, those cultured on polystyrene microspheres\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n13 of 18\nshowed similar chondrogenic differentiation compared to controls using an assessment of\ncartilage–micromass diameters.\nFigure 8.

Discussions\nThrough novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have\nbeen shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer poten-\ntially greater translational beneﬁts. SSEA-3(+) Muse cells, a representative type of highly\nfunctional mesenchymal stem cell, are known to show superior multipotency compared\nto regular stem cells [32]. However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow\nhASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with\nhigher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs to only\napproximately 1% [19]. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical and environmental\nstress greatly inﬂuences proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and the multipotency\nof stem cells [33,34]. Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been\nthe most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant inﬂuence on\ncultured cells.\nNumerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell\nproliferation [35] and differentiation [36,37]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cul-\ntured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38].\nTherefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated,\nunaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to\nprevious studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity\nvector to an average of 10−3× g over time [24]. In our experimental system, although\ncells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the micro-\nspheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells’ gravity\nvectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their ﬁnal cumulative gravity\nvectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been\ndeveloped [39,40], but they involve signiﬁcant costs and are very difﬁcult to standardize.\nMoreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-\nproliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions\nfor the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41].\nIn previous studies, micro-scale carriers fabricated from a variety of natural and syn-\nthetic polymers have shown signiﬁcant potential for cell growth, speciﬁc differentiation,\nand the delivery of hASCs [42,43]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation\nhas been carried out on the feasibility of culturing cells using stirred microspheres for the\nstated purpose of mimicking a microgravity environment. The outcomes of this study\nexceeded our expectations. Seven days of polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures\nunder static conditions produced an increased number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to\npolystyrene dish cultures, and those under dynamic conditions exhibited a much higher\nnumber of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. These results clearly revealed a positive inﬂuence of micro-\nspheres on the selective proliferation of SSEA-3(+) cells, especially in those experiments\ncombined with a microgravity environment.\nBy comparison, our stress-exposure treatments were not very suitable for the expan-\nsion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. Heneidi et al. reported that Muse cells could be isolated from\nlipoaspirates using severe cellular stress, such as long-term exposure to collagenase [44].\nWe also conﬁrmed that exposure to proteolysis produced the best results among our stress\nconditions, increasing the proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs by 3.3-fold (4.2%) compared\nto monolayer cultures (1.3%). During preliminary studies (unpublished data) to enhance\nthe ratio of SSEA-3(+) hASCs (known to be stress-tolerant [19,32]), stress magnitude was\ncarefully optimized in each experiment. However, because 37.6% of viable cells were lost,\nthe ﬁnal number of proteolytic solution-treated SSEA-3(+) hASCs was only 1.3-fold more\n(1.7 × 103) compared to the controls (1.3 × 103), with no statistically signiﬁcant difference.\nThese results suggest that exposure to severe stress can concentrate SSEA-3(+) hASCs\nthrough the selective depletion of SSEA-3(−) cells, but such stress can also inhibit cell\nproliferation. Instead of concentration, microsphere cultures under microgravity condi-\ntions increased SSEA-3(+) hASCs by proliferation (Figure 9). In other words, the present\nmicrogravity culture conditions increased not only the proportion, but also the number,\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n15 of 18\nof SSEA-3(+) cells to actualize regenerative therapies requiring these highly therapeutic\ncells. However, a limitation of this study is that we only assessed SSEA-3 as a pluripotent\nmarker in stress-exposure experiments. Additional research including analyses of the other\npluripotent markers (e.g., Oct4 and Sox2) may further emphasize the differences between\nmicrogravity cultures and stress-exposure cultures, or reveal new characteristics of the\ntwo cultures.\nFigure 9. Schematic representation of the study. Human adipose-derived stem cells are normally capable of heterogeneous\npotency. Exposure to stress can selectively deplete regular stem cells, but does not increase the number of highly functional\nstem cells. In contrast, microgravity/microsphere cultures can selectively cause the proliferation of highly functional cell\nsubpopulations to reach the numbers required for regenerative therapies.\nFurthermore, hASCs harvested from microgravity–microsphere cultures had higher\nexpression levels of the pluripotent markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF, and CD34\ncompared to hASCs cultured in monolayers. OCT4 and NANOG are known to be involved\nin the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells, while SOX2, MYC, and KLF expression\nact as transcription factors to control genes involved during embryonic development [19].\nCD34 has been reported to contribute to the proliferative ability of hASCs both by us [23,45]\nand by others [46,47]. However, the upregulation of nuclear stem-cell markers was hardly\ndetected in hASCs from static microsphere cultures, suggesting that the microgravity\nenvironment may play a key role in preserving hASC functionality. In a previous report,\nspaceﬂight experiments demonstrated that altered gene expression was associated with\nepigenetic changes, such as chromatin re-modeling and DNA methylation [48]. The present\nresults extend these observations by demonstrating improved proliferation, angiogenesis,\nand differentiation into mesenchymal lineages (adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes)\nin hASCs from microgravity–microsphere cultures compared to hASCs from cultures under\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n16 of 18\nnormal conditions. However, the fold change of the genes analyzed by RT-PCR was not so\nlarge in this study (less than 1.5), and future studies are required for further qualiﬁcation\nof these genes through optimization of the microgravity culture protocols.\nInterestingly, the efﬁcacies for collagen and polystyrene microspheres to select for\nproliferation in highly functional hASCs were roughly equivalent in the present study.\nPolystyrene microbeads require a plasma coating prior to use to enable good cell attach-\nment; therefore, collagen microbeads may be the superior practical choice for regenerative\ntherapy applications. In addition, as a biodegradable biomaterial, collagen has the ad-\nvantage that such beads may be clinically administered into a target organ together with\nhASCs; it may even augment hASC survival and functionality after transplantation by\nacting as a biological cell scaffold [1,42].\n5. Conclusions\nWe cultured hASCs with microspheres using three-dimensional movement to create\nmicrogravity conditions for the preservation of stemness, while at the same time preserving\ncell–microsphere adhesion to maximize cell quantities. This new cell-culturing technique\nselectively enhanced the proliferation of highly functional stem cells, demonstrating supe-\nrior stemness, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenic abilities, which may provide for\nenhanced treatments for intractable human diseases compared to current hASC treatments.\nHowever, further studies are required to optimize a culture protocol to maximize the\nselective expansion efﬁciency and to investigate the therapeutic value of these cells using\nin vivo experiments before clinical trials can proceed.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/2073-440\n9/10/3/560/s1, Video S1: Microgravity culture with microspheres under dynamic conditions.

This review\nexamines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for\nhuman health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key\nmechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differenti-\nation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the\nformation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic\nin vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally,\nmicrogravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including\nHippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and\ncardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hep-\natic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid\ndysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss.

Introduction\nMicrogravity, a condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible gravita-\ntional forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments designed to simulate\nthis state [1,2]. In cellular biology, microgravity presents a unique opportunity to study\nhow cells respond to the drastic reduction in gravity—a fundamental factor that regulates\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26073058\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n2 of 23\nnumerous cellular processes on Earth [3–5]. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical\nforces that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations, impacting\ncytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling. These changes in turn\naffect critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, communication,\nand survival [4–6].\nHistorically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space stations, such\nas the International Space Station, and on suborbital platforms. More recently, terrestrial\nlaboratories have adopted advanced technologies, such as rotating bioreactors, to simulate\nmicrogravity conditions [1,7,8]. These investigations, conducted both in space and on Earth,\nhave gained importance due to their dual applications: safeguarding astronaut health and\naddressing terrestrial diseases [1,9,10].\nThis review aims to explore recent advances in understanding the effects of microgravity\non biological processes, emphasizing its implications and applications for human health.\n2. Materials and Methods\nA comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Em-\nbase databases. Search terms were structured following the PICOT framework, with the\ncomponents defined as follows:\n•\nPopulation: Stem cells, T cells, endothelial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, and bone cells.\n•\nIntervention: Microgravity, simulated microgravity, or microgravity conditions.\n•\nComparison: Cells under normal or standard gravity conditions.\n•\nOutcomes: Effects on cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ\nhomeostasis, and immune health.\n•\nTiming: Publications with no start date restriction, available up to November 2024.\nThe research question, based on the PICO framework, was as follows:\n“How does microgravity (including simulated conditions) affect stem cells, T cells, en-\ndothelial cells, kidney cells, and other biological cells compared to cells under normal\ngravity conditions, specifically in terms of cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular\nmetabolism, organ homeostasis, and immune health?”\nTo ensure a comprehensive search, relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms\nwere included. Key terms covered the study populations (e.g., stem cells, T cells, endothe-\nlial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, bone cells), conditions (e.g., microgravity, simulated\nmicrogravity, standard gravity), and outcomes of interest (e.g., cell proliferation, tissue\nregeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, immune health).\nThe literature search was performed in December 2024 and included publications in\nEnglish and Spanish. Eligible studies encompassed observational studies, in vitro research,\nand experimental investigations that addressed the effects of microgravity on critical\nbiological processes. The retrieved results were systematically categorized based on their\nfocus, enabling a detailed analysis of microgravity’s impact on different biological functions.\nThe findings were then contrasted with observations from cells maintained under standard\ngravity conditions, providing a comprehensive comparison of cellular adaptations in\nthese environments.\n3. Effects of Microgravity on the Immune System\n3.1. Alterations in Immune Cells\nMicrogravity significantly impacts the immune system, compromising the develop-\nment, function, and response of immune cells, which weakens the body’s defenses in\nspace environments. Hematopoietic stem cells, essential for generating immune cells,\nshow impaired differentiation into macrophages, critical for infection control. Furthermore,\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n3 of 23\nan imbalance between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory and repair)\nmacrophages disrupts the immune system’s ability to handle infections and repair tis-\nsues [1,2].\nDendritic cells, pivotal in T lymphocyte activation via antigen presentation, are also\nadversely affected. Key molecules such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and\ncostimulatory proteins CD80 and CD86 show reduced expression, diminishing dendritic\ncell functionality. Notably, brief exposures to microgravity transiently enhance dendritic\ncell activity; however, this effect is not sustained over the long term [2].\nNeutrophils exhibit increased numbers in microgravity but with reduced functionality,\nimpairing their ability to destroy microorganisms effectively. B lymphocytes, responsible for\nhumoral immunity, demonstrate decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Similarly,\nnatural killer (NK) cells, critical for innate immunity, experience reduced cytotoxic activity,\nlimiting their ability to eliminate tumors or infected cells [2,3] (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Effects of microgravity on the human immune system. This figure illustrates the complex\nimpact of microgravity on various immune cell populations and key molecular signaling pathways.\nExposure to microgravity leads to significant alterations in immune cell function, including a shift in\nmacrophage polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2\nphenotype. Dendritic cells exhibit a reduced capacity for antigen presentation, while neutrophil\nnumbers increase, but their functionality declines. Additionally, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer\n(NK) cells is diminished, potentially impairing immune surveillance. T cell activation, proliferation,\nand cytokine production are also suppressed, accompanied by decreased expression of IL-2R. At the\nmolecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK\ncascade and the NF-κB pathway, further contributing to immune dysregulation. These findings\nhighlight the widespread and multifaceted effects of microgravity on immune system function, which\nmay have implications for long-term space travel and astronaut health.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n4 of 23\n3.2. Impact on T Cells\nMicrogravity profoundly affects T cell-mediated immunity, disrupting activation,\nproliferation, and apoptosis. Studies using concanavalin A—a standard activator of resting\nT cells—revealed significant inhibition of activation and proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+ T\ncells, with the effects intensifying over longer exposure durations. Reduced expression of\nactivation markers such as CD25 (IL-2 receptor), CD69 (early activation marker), and CD71\n(iron transport marker) underscores this dysfunction [11,12].\nCD4+ T cells, critical for regulating immune responses through cytokines like IL-2 and\nIFN-γ, show a greater reduction in proliferation and cytokine production compared to CD8+\nT cells. Even brief exposure (8 h) to microgravity notably suppresses CD4+ cell functions,\nwhile CD8+ cells require longer exposure (16 h) to exhibit similar impairments [11,12].\nCytokine production is notably compromised under microgravity. CD4+ cells exhibit\ndecreased secretion of IL-2, essential for T cell expansion, and IFN-γ, crucial for macrophage\nactivation and antiviral defense. These deficiencies indicate a reduced capacity of T cells to\ncoordinate and amplify immune responses [11].\nApoptosis of T cells is accelerated under microgravity, with an earlier onset of late\napoptotic processes. Pre-exposed cells show an increase in late-stage apoptosis and a reduc-\ntion in early-stage apoptosis, indicating a faster progression through apoptotic pathways\ncompared to controls under normal gravity. This effect is linked to increased expression\nof the Fas receptor in CD8+ cells, a critical component of the Fas/FasL pathway, which\nregulates apoptosis through external signals [12–14] (Figure 1).\n3.3. Impact on Key Molecular Pathways\nAt the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including\nRAS, ERK, and NF-κB. The RAS pathway, which governs cell proliferation and survival,\nshows reduced activity under microgravity, leading to impaired cell growth. Similarly,\nERK, which is essential for cell differentiation and responses to external stimuli, undergoes\nalterations that hinder the activation and specialization of macrophages and lymphocytes.\nNF-κB, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, exhibits inconsistent activation in\nmicrogravity, resulting in inadequate immune responses [1,4].\nResearch on microgravity has also revealed significant effects on cancer biology, includ-\ning the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), the reorganization of the cytoskeleton,\nand the regulation of key proteins such as p53 (a tumor suppressor), NF-κB (a regulator\nof immune responses and inflammation), and BAX (a pro-apoptotic protein involved in\nprogrammed cell death). These processes promote apoptosis in various cancer cell types.\nIn cell lines from breast (MCF-7), thyroid (FTC-133), and lung (A549) cancers, microgravity-\ninduced changes include decreased cell adhesion and altered gene expression, particularly\nin molecules like E-cadherin (important for cell adhesion and tumor invasion suppression),\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis), and vimentin\n(a protein associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cell migration), thereby\naffecting tumor proliferation and dissemination [15,16].\n4. Impact on Cancer Biology\n4.1. Cancer Stem Cells\nThe study of cancer stem cells (CSCs) under simulated microgravity conditions pro-\nvides critical insights into their behavior in extreme environments, with profound implica-\ntions for oncology and regenerative medicine. CSCs, characterized by their self-renewal\nand differentiation capabilities, contribute to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance,\nand metastasis [5,6].\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n5 of 23\nIn cancers such as breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer, CSCs are identified using\nspecific markers, enabling their isolation and detailed analysis. Under simulated micrograv-\nity, these cells exhibit significant changes in morphology and growth patterns, including\nthe formation of multicellular spheroids. These three-dimensional structures closely mimic\nin vivo tumor organization, offering a robust model for studying the effects of microgravity\non tumor biology [5,7,8].\nExposure to microgravity induces notable cellular changes, including increased apop-\ntosis and decreased expression of pluripotency-related markers, suggesting a shift toward\ndifferentiation. This differentiation reduces CSC resistance, potentially enhancing their\nsusceptibility to treatments. In gastrointestinal cancers like colon and pancreatic cancer,\nsimulated microgravity has been linked to increased expression of specific markers, re-\nflecting alterations in the regulatory mechanisms of cell growth and differentiation. These\nchanges can significantly influence tumor progression and the efficacy of oncological\ntreatments [6–8] (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Microgravity-induced changes in cancer. This figure illustrates the diverse effects of\nmicrogravity on cancer cells, with a particular focus on cancer stem cells (CSCs) and thyroid cancer.\nExposure to microgravity has been shown to increase apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer\ncells. It also alters CSC properties, leading to a decrease in pluripotency markers and an increase\nin differentiation. Additionally, microgravity induces structural changes in the cytoskeleton and\nextracellular matrix, which may influence tumor progression. In thyroid cancer, microgravity reduces\nproliferation and overall growth, while also diminishing the malignant phenotype in follicular\nthyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, despite these inhibitory effects, microgravity appears to increase\nthe susceptibility of cancer cells, potentially enhancing their response to treatments, as suggested by\nthe syringe graphic. These findings highlight the complex and sometimes counterintuitive influence\nof microgravity on cancer biology.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n6 of 23\nMicrogravity modulates apoptosis, a key defense against abnormal cell proliferation.\nMany cancer cells under microgravity show increased apoptosis due to altered mechanical\nforces, while some acquire stem-like properties, enhancing resistance, plasticity, and therapy\nresistance [17,18]. Microgravity also induces the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS),\nwhich mimic solid tumors and exhibit increased resistance to chemotherapy and radiation,\nsuggesting more aggressive cancer states. Additionally, reduced gravity downregulates\nadhesion proteins (e.g., E-cadherin, vinculin, paxillin), weakening cell–cell interactions and\npotentially enhancing metastatic potential. The combination of microgravity and ionizing\nradiation exacerbates DNA damage, genomic instability, and mutations in tumor cells,\nhighlighting the need for protective measures during space missions and offering insights\ninto cancer treatment [19–22].\nSimulated microgravity, using devices like the rotating wall bioreactor (RWV) and\nrandom positioning machine (RPM), replicates certain effects of real microgravity (r-µg) but\nwith some differences. High-energy radiation with high linear energy transfer (high LET)\nincreases genomic instability and mutation risks, promoting apoptosis and chromosomal\naberrations [23,24].\nIn gliomas (U251 model), microgravity reduces the activity of focal adhesion kinase\n(FAK), RhoA, and Nek2 kinase, inhibiting tumor cell migration. Immune cells, such as\nT lymphocytes and macrophages, show decreased functionality, compromising immuno-\nsurveillance and hindering cancer detection [25–27].\nRecent findings suggest that microgravity could offer therapeutic benefits by inhibiting\nNF-κB, reducing cancer spread, and decreasing VEGF activity to limit tumor growth\nthrough reduced angiogenesis. Changes in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway may slow tumor\ngrowth and metastasis. CSCs, typically resistant to therapies, become more vulnerable\nunder microgravity, which also alters extracellular vesicle (EV) protein and microRNA\ncontent, opening opportunities for new biomarkers and targeted therapies [28].\nThe mechanosensitive channel ELKIN1 plays a crucial role in cellular responses to mi-\ncrogravity. Microgravity reduces tumor cell adhesion and invasion, offering potential thera-\npeutic benefits, but these effects are ELKIN1-dependent. Its absence preserves cell structure\nand adhesion stability in microgravity, protecting healthy cells during prolonged exposure,\nbut may enhance the persistence of cancer cells, limiting therapy effectiveness [29].\nAt the molecular level, microgravity reduces the nuclear localization of the transcrip-\ntional regulator YAP1, limiting excessive cell proliferation and invasiveness. This effect\ndepends on ELKIN1 expression; its absence could lead to resistance or diminished respon-\nsiveness to mechanical stimuli. ELKIN1-mediated reduction in focal adhesion proteins may\nlimit tumor aggressiveness but could pose a structural disadvantage for healthy tissues\nduring extended space missions [29].\n4.2. Thyroid Cancer\nMicrogravity, whether experienced in space or simulated on Earth, provides a unique\nexperimental environment that has greatly advanced our understanding of cancer biology,\nparticularly thyroid cancer [30–33]. For nearly two decades, studies on thyroid cancer cells\nunder microgravity have yielded valuable insights into tumor behavior that are difficult to\nachieve under conventional laboratory conditions.\nIn microgravity, adherent thyroid cancer cells lose their adhesion properties and\norganize into multicellular spheroids. These structures closely resemble the physiological\ncharacteristics of tumors in vivo, making them ideal models for studying metastasis and\nevaluating novel targeted therapies [30,31].\nMicrogravity also affects fundamental cellular processes, including apoptosis, cy-\ntoskeletal organization, and extracellular matrix dynamics, which are critical for cell growth\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n7 of 23\nand proliferation. Notably, follicular thyroid cancer cells exposed to microgravity have\ndemonstrated a tendency to adopt a less malignant phenotype. This suggests that micro-\ngravity conditions may induce favorable changes, potentially aiding in the treatment of\nthyroid cancer [30,31].\nThe findings from these studies have the potential to revolutionize traditional oncology\nresearch approaches. They facilitate the identification of key cellular alterations in cancer\npathogenesis and support the development of innovative therapies aimed at improving\npatient outcomes. Furthermore, these investigations pave the way for novel preventive\nstrategies and more effective treatments based on the unique cellular properties observed\nunder microgravity [30,32].\n5. Impacts on Tissues and Organ Systems\n5.1. Microvascular Endothelial Cells\nSimulated microgravity profoundly affects microvascular endothelial cells, which\nplay a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis by regulating inflammation, angiogenesis, and\nvascular permeability [9,10].\nUnder normal gravity, endothelial cells respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli to\npreserve vascular function. However, under simulated microgravity, significant alterations\nare observed. One prominent effect is the inhibition of cell proliferation, which delays the\nrepair of damaged blood vessels. Reduced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine\ncrucial for the inflammatory response, further compromises immune functionality and\nvascular repair capacity [9,23].\nInterestingly, microgravity stimulates the synthesis of nitric oxide, a critical mediator\nfor blood vessel dilation and angiogenesis. This effect is linked to the activation of en-\ndothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). While nitric oxide promotes vascular adaptation, its\ndysregulation can lead to pathological states, depending on the physiological context [9,23].\nResearch on simulated microgravity has also revealed significant effects on endothelial\ncell integrity and function. In one study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, essential\nregulators of cardiovascular homeostasis, were exposed to simulated microgravity for up to\n72 h using an RPM, which continuously rotates to nullify Earth’s gravitational vector [24].\nAfter 24 h, notable changes in cellular biomechanical properties were observed, in-\ncluding a marked reduction in cell stiffness (Young’s modulus) and viscosity. Specifically,\ncellular elasticity decreased by approximately 30%, reaching critical levels with a 75% re-\nduction after 72 h. This loss of rigidity makes endothelial cells more vulnerable to external\nhemodynamic stress, potentially impairing vascular integrity and increasing the risk of\nendothelial dysfunction [23,24].\nAdditionally, endothelial cells exhibited morphological changes under simulated\nmicrogravity conditions. Normally elongated and spindle-shaped, cells adopted a distinctly\nrounded phenotype after 24 h. The increase in circularity—more than three times greater\nthan that of control cells—indicates significant cytoskeletal reorganization, which could\naffect vascular permeability and the cells’ ability to respond to mechanical stress over\ntime [23,34].\nAt the molecular level, these morphological alterations were associated with sub-\nstantial reductions in key cytoskeletal components. Western blot analysis revealed a\n65% reduction in actin filament levels and a 26% reduction in β-tubulin, a protein crit-\nical for microtubule integrity. Immunofluorescence confirmed these findings, showing\ndiscontinuities in cortical actin filaments and abnormal redistribution of microtubules,\nparticularly around the nucleus. These results highlight impaired structural integrity and\nsuggest that endothelial cells may have a compromised ability to respond to biomechanical\nstimuli [23,34] (Figure 3).\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n8 of 23\nFigure 3. Structural and functional adaptations of tissues and organ systems in microgravity environ-\nments. This figure illustrates the broad impact of microgravity on various tissues and organ systems,\nhighlighting key structural and functional adaptations. Microvascular endothelial cells exhibit inhib-\nited proliferation, decreased IL-6 production, and increased nitric oxide (NO) production. In the liver,\nmicrogravity alters hepatic metabolism, leading to increased lipotoxicity, elevated angiopoietin levels,\nupregulation of lipid metabolism genes, and dysregulation of immune response genes. Intestinal\nhomeostasis is also affected, with observed dysbiosis, endotoxemia, altered bile acid content, and\nincreased levels of intestinal stress hormones. In terms of bone health and mechanotransduction,\nmicrogravity induces significant bone mass loss, accompanied by a reduction in actin filaments\nand decreased cell stiffness in osteoblasts. Kidney cells experience metabolic alterations, includ-\ning reduced oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, alongside increased expression\nof fibronectin (FN1), MMP7, and TGFBI. Reproductive cells are also impacted, with evidence of\nreduced egg quality, the loss of polarization in granulosa cells, and a decrease in microvilli in eggs.\nAdditionally, cardiomyocytes exhibit increased maturation and functionality, enhanced mitochondrial\nbiogenesis, improved calcium storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the formation of sarcomeres\nand Z-disks. These findings collectively underscore the widespread and system-specific alterations\ninduced by microgravity, significantly influencing cellular function and overall tissue homeostasis.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n9 of 23\nEndothelial cells exposed to microgravity also form three-dimensional spheroids,\nwhich closely mimic in vivo blood vessel structures. These 3D models are invaluable for\nstudying microgravity-induced changes in endothelial function, enabling more physiologi-\ncally relevant investigations compared to traditional 2D cultures [9,10,23].\nCollectively, these findings reveal that microgravity disrupts endothelial physiology,\ninfluencing cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and vascular regulation. These\ninsights have implications for diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and other circulatory\ndisorders. They underscore the need for further research to mitigate vascular risks during\nspace missions and explore potential therapeutic applications on Earth [9].\n5.2. Hepatic Metabolism and Intestinal Homeostasis\nMicrogravity, a defining feature of spaceflight and terrestrial simulations, profoundly\nimpacts the metabolism and functionality of various organs, particularly the liver. Experi-\nmental models using rhesus macaques have shown that prolonged exposure to microgravity\ninduces significant metabolic alterations similar to those observed in rodents. These in-\nclude lipid accumulation and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, reflecting the\ndisruption of hepatic metabolic homeostasis. Such findings underscore the importance of\nexploring the effects of microgravity on metabolic regulation in animal models and future\nhuman studies [34–36] (Figure 3).\nIn a 42-day head-down bed rest model simulating microgravity, rhesus macaques\ndeveloped mild liver lesions, fat vacuole accumulation, and inflammatory cell infiltra-\ntion. These hepatic changes were accompanied by a marked increase in plasma levels of\nangiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), a key biomarker associated with metabolic disorders and\nlipid dysregulation. These results suggest that microgravity may induce hepatic lipotoxicity,\na phenomenon previously documented in rodents but requiring further investigation in\nprimates and humans to better understand its clinical relevance [34–36].\nAt the molecular level, transcriptomic analyses of liver samples from macaques ex-\nposed to microgravity revealed overexpression of genes associated with lipid metabolism\nand downregulation of genes linked to the innate immune response. These molecular\nchanges could impair the liver’s ability to manage metabolic stress, a critical function for\nmaintaining long-term health. Additionally, disruptions in fatty acid metabolism were iden-\ntified, potentially contributing to lipid dysregulation associated with metabolic diseases\nsuch as diabetes and obesity [34,35].\nAnother noteworthy finding was the impact of microgravity on the gut microbiota, a\nkey regulator of hepatic metabolism through the gut–liver axis. Macaques subjected to the\nhead-down bed rest model exhibited intestinal dysbiosis, endotoxemia, and altered bile acid\ncomposition. These gut alterations were accompanied by elevated levels of stress hormones,\nsuggesting systemic metabolic imbalance triggered by microgravity exposure [34,36].\nThe effects of microgravity on liver function and metabolic homeostasis carry signifi-\ncant implications for space medicine. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor\nliver function and the gut–liver axis during prolonged space missions to mitigate potential\nhealth risks. Moreover, the metabolic changes observed in animal models provide valuable\ninsights into terrestrial diseases such as diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This\nknowledge could contribute to the development of more effective treatments and innova-\ntive therapeutic strategies in regenerative medicine, ultimately benefiting both astronauts\nand the general population [34–36].\n5.3. Bone Health and Mechanotransduction\nMicrogravity profoundly impacts the mechanotransduction of human osteoblasts.\nAstronauts who spend prolonged periods in space experience accelerated bone mass loss,\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n10 of 23\nmaking the International Space Station (ISS) an ideal platform for studying the mechanisms\nunderlying osteoporosis in zero-gravity conditions [37–39].\nIn this context, innovative experimental approaches have been developed, including\nthe use of microfluidic microchips and collagen-encapsulated cell spheroids. These ad-\nvanced models enable researchers to investigate how the absence of mechanical loading\naffects bone cell maturation and mineralization. Studies have shown that microgravity\ndecreases cell stiffness and reduces the levels of filamentous actin, a cytoskeletal component\ncritical for maintaining cell tension and facilitating mechanotransduction. For example,\nexperiments conducted on the ISS using automated microfluidic devices have provided\nvaluable insights into the mechanical properties of human osteoblasts under microgravity\nconditions [37–39] (Figure 3).\nResults from these experiments reveal that osteoblasts exposed to microgravity de-\nvelop elongated protrusions compared to terrestrial samples, indicating a phenomenon\nreferred to as “cellular softening”. This structural change correlates with a reduction in\nactin fiber density, consistent with findings from prior studies conducted under simulated\nmicrogravity [40–42].\nThese structural and cytoskeletal alterations highlight disruptions in mechanotrans-\nduction, the process through which cells sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. Without\nthe constant gravitational forces present on Earth, osteoblasts lose the ability to maintain\ntheir tensional structure and perform optimally, contributing to the bone demineralization\nobserved in astronauts [38,39].\nFurther research has utilized three-dimensional spheroid models, which better repli-\ncate physiological conditions than traditional two-dimensional cell cultures. Collagen-\nencapsulated osteoblast spheroids subjected to controlled pressures under microgravity\nexhibited a reduction in the expression of key mechanosensitive proteins, such as Yes-\nassociated protein (YAP). This suggests that microgravity disrupts mechanical signaling\npathways critical for cellular regulation and bone homeostasis [37–49].\nMechanotransduction is a crucial process by which cells sense and respond to me-\nchanical stimuli through interactions with the extracellular matrix. On Earth, proteins\nlike YAP/TAZ translate mechanical forces into gene expression changes, modulating cell\ngrowth, differentiation, and survival. Under microgravity, the diminished activity of\nYAP/TAZ leads to varying outcomes in different cancers, such as reduced cell prolifer-\nation or increased invasiveness due to altered mechanosignaling. Understanding these\ndifferential responses could inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting these vulnerabili-\nties [19–22].\nImportantly, the application of compressive pressure partially restored YAP expression\nand increased pSMAD1/5/9 levels, demonstrating that biomechanical signals can reacti-\nvate essential molecular pathways, even under microgravity conditions. These findings\nunderscore the potential of mechanical interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of\nmicrogravity on bone tissue [39–41,43].\nThe implications of these studies are significant. They not only advance our un-\nderstanding of how microgravity influences cellular biology but also pave the way for\ndeveloping therapeutic strategies to combat bone loss in both space environments and\nterrestrial patients with osteoporosis. Additionally, the creation of devices that simulate\nmechanical loads could benefit astronauts and individuals on Earth, emphasizing the criti-\ncal role of biomechanics in maintaining bone health and cellular functionality in extreme\nconditions [39–41,43].\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n11 of 23\n5.4. Kidney Cells\nA recent study utilizing a microphysiological model of human renal proximal tubules\ninvestigated the effects of microgravity on the cellular ability to metabolize vitamin D and\nrespond to human serum [44,45].\nThe findings revealed that short-term exposure to microgravity does not significantly\nalter essential biochemical pathways in renal cells, indicating that fundamental processes\nremain intact. In this experiment, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were cultured in a\nmicrophysiological system and exposed to 2% human serum and vitamin D [25(OH)D3].\nBiomarkers such as kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were mea-\nsured to assess cellular responses [44–46].\nTranscriptomic analyses, conducted via RNA sequencing, monitored vitamin D\nmetabolites and key genes involved in its metabolism, including CYP27B1, CYP24A1,\nand CYP3A5 [44]. Surprisingly, no significant differences in vitamin D metabolism were\nobserved between microgravity and terrestrial conditions. However, exposure to hu-\nman serum elicited similar metabolic responses in both environments, characterized by\nmetabolic reprogramming, alterations in bioenergetic processes, and the presence of a\npro-inflammatory extracellular environment [44–46].\nOne of the most striking observations was the differential regulation of over 2000\ngenes after exposure to human serum, regardless of gravitational conditions. Affected\npathways included the cell cycle, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, and chemokine\nsignaling [45]. Notably, a marked reduction in the expression of genes associated with\noxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism indicated diminished mitochondrial\nrespiration, suggesting a metabolic shift in kidney cells [45].\nThese findings imply that kidney cells, when exposed to human serum, redirect\ntheir metabolism toward a proliferation-focused strategy, reducing reliance on traditional\nenergy pathways. Concurrently, significant changes in the extracellular environment\nwere observed, indicative of tissue remodeling. This phenomenon was supported by the\noverexpression of genes related to the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin (FN1)\nand transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBI), as well as enzymes such\nas metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), which are involved in remodeling and reorganizing the\ncellular environment. These adaptations may represent a cellular response to protein\nchallenges in human serum or could signal underlying pathological processes [44].\nIn addition to bioenergetic and extracellular matrix alterations, broader metabolic\nreorganization signals were detected. Elevated cytosolic cholesterol levels, inferred from\nthe repression of genes regulated by the SREBF2 factor, reflected shifts in intracellular\nmetabolic balance. While these effects were consistent across microgravity and terrestrial\nconditions, their significance lies in demonstrating how human serum, as an external\nstimulus, can drive profound cellular changes independently of gravity.\nThese results reinforce the notion that certain fundamental processes in renal cells\nremain relatively stable under microgravity conditions during short-term exposures. How-\never, they also highlight the need for further research into prolonged microgravity en-\nvironments, where cellular adaptations may become more pronounced or clinically rele-\nvant [44,45].\nThe implications of these discoveries are significant for both space exploration and\nterrestrial medicine. In the context of spaceflight, the findings provide critical insights\ninto how kidneys might adapt to microgravity, ensuring that essential functions such as\nfiltration and blood compound regulation are maintained during extended missions. On\nEarth, these studies offer valuable perspectives on how kidney cells respond to metabolic\nand protein stress, potentially informing the development of advanced therapies for kidney\ndiseases [44] (Figure 3).\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n12 of 23\n5.5. Reproductive System Ovarian Follicles and Egg Quality\nSimulated microgravity has provided valuable insights into how this unique envi-\nronment impacts egg quality and ovarian follicle development. Ovarian follicles, which\nare critical for egg formation, rely on intricate interactions between granulosa cells and\nthe egg to ensure proper maturation. However, the specific effects of microgravity on\nthese interactions and the overall evolution of follicles have only recently begun to be\nunderstood [47].\nIn an experiment replicating microgravity conditions, ovarian follicles were cultured\nin a simulated system. The results indicated that while follicle growth and survival rates\nwere not significantly affected and remained comparable to those observed under normal\ngravity conditions, the quality of the eggs released was markedly reduced [47–49].\nElectron microscopy revealed alterations in the cellular structures responsible for\ncommunication between granulosa cells and the egg. These structural changes resulted in a\nloss of organization within the granulosa cells, disrupting the secretion of essential factors\nrequired for egg maturation. However, supplementing growth factors and antioxidants\nsignificantly improved egg quality, suggesting that the adverse effects of microgravity\ncould be mitigated through targeted interventions [47–49].\nFurther analysis of the eggs highlighted deficiencies in the distribution and density\nof cortical granules, structures vital for maturation. Additionally, there was a notable\nreduction in the number of eggs capable of releasing the first polar body—a critical process\nin egg development. These deficiencies were linked to increased oxidative stress levels,\nwhich further contributed to the decline in egg quality [47–49].\nAnother key finding was the loss of polarity in granulosa cells, which inhibited the\nformation of cellular projections essential for interacting with the egg. This disruption\nimpaired communication between granulosa cells and the egg, negatively affecting the\nmaturation process. Moreover, microgravity altered the formation of microvilli in the egg,\nstructures crucial for interaction with surrounding cells. Eggs cultured under microgravity\nconditions exhibited a significant reduction in both the number and size of microvilli, po-\ntentially limiting their ability to release factors essential for development [47–49] (Figure 3).\n5.6. Cardiomyocyte Maturation and Functionality\nSimulated microgravity has been shown to significantly enhance the maturation and\nfunctionality of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. One of the\nmost notable improvements observed under these conditions is mitochondrial biogenesis,\na critical process for cellular maturation [9,10,23,50]. Mitochondrial biogenesis enables\ncells to produce energy more efficiently, a key factor for the proper functioning of mature\ncardiomyocytes. Experimental data have demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial\ncontent, evidenced by the expression of specific mitochondrial proteins and an elevated\nratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA. These findings suggest that microgravity\nstimulates mitochondrial formation, improving the cells’ capacity to generate ATP, the\nprimary energy source for cardiac function [6,50].\nIn addition to increased mitochondrial content, simulated microgravity enhances mito-\nchondrial respiration. This improvement, evidenced by elevated maximal respiration levels\nand ATP production, ensures the energy supply necessary for cardiomyocyte contraction\nand relaxation. These observations highlight the potential of microgravity to promote\nmetabolic maturation in cardiomyocytes, rendering them more functional and suitable for\ntherapeutic applications [6,50].\nAnother critical aspect influenced by microgravity is calcium handling, a vital process\nfor cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. Cells cultured under microgravity exhibited\ngreater amplitude in calcium transients, reflecting enhanced calcium storage capacity in\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n13 of 23\nthe sarcoplasmic reticulum, a structure crucial for regulating intracellular calcium concen-\ntrations. Efficient calcium handling is essential for effective cardiac function, as it enables\nstronger and more coordinated muscle fiber contractions. These findings indicate that\ncardiomyocytes cultured in microgravity are not only more metabolically advanced but\nalso display improved functionality consistent with mature cardiomyocytes [6,50].\nSimulated microgravity also positively affects the structural properties of cardiomy-\nocytes. Observations include increased sarcomere length, the functional unit responsible\nfor muscle contraction, and longer Z-disks, key structures for transmitting contraction\nforces. Additionally, nuclear eccentricity and diameter were increased, further indicating a\nhigher degree of cellular maturation. These structural enhancements bring cardiomyocytes\ncultured in microgravity closer to the characteristics of fully functional human cardiac cells,\nreinforcing their ability to perform physiological functions effectively [6,50].\nThe duration of exposure to microgravity plays a pivotal role in maximizing these\nbenefits. Recent studies suggest that a 7-day exposure period is optimal for promoting\nsignificant improvements in cardiomyocyte maturation. Prolonged exposures of 14 days,\nhowever, did not yield additional benefits, indicating a specific time window for max-\nimizing the positive effects of microgravity. Optimizing culture conditions within this\ntimeframe is essential to achieve the best outcomes [50,51].\nAdvances in utilizing simulated microgravity to enhance cardiomyocyte maturation\nand functionality open new avenues in regenerative medicine, particularly for treating\ncardiac diseases such as myocardial infarctions. The ability to produce high-quality, mature\ncardiomyocytes is critical for developing effective cellular grafts capable of integrating\ninto damaged tissues and restoring cardiac functionality. These breakthroughs represent a\nsignificant step forward in biotechnology, with far-reaching implications for the treatment\nof cardiac pathologies [6,50,51] (Figure 3).\n6. Impacts on Stem Cells and Cell Regeneration\nMicrogravity has provided significant insights into how this environment influences\nfundamental biological processes such as tissue regeneration and cell repair [52,53]. Re-\nsearch conducted in real spaceflights and terrestrial simulations has demonstrated that\nmicrogravity impacts protein expression and the regulation of cellular pathways critical for\nthe growth and regeneration of various stem cell types. One of the most notable pathways\naffected is the Hippo pathway, which plays a central role in cell proliferation and tissue\ndamage response. Under microgravity conditions, this pathway is temporarily deactivated,\ncreating a favorable state for cell proliferation and tissue repair. These effects have shown\nparticular promise in regenerating organs such as the heart, with potential applications\nextending to other tissues [53,54].\nThe replication of microgravity effects in terrestrial simulations opens new possibilities\nfor exploring therapeutic treatments based on this phenomenon [17,52–54]. Findings sug-\ngest that microgravity could serve as a valuable tool for enhancing the regenerative capacity\nof stem cells without requiring invasive or complex technologies. Additionally, combining\nmicrogravity exposure with the use of certain drugs or microRNA manipulation—key\nregulators of gene expression—can amplify the activity of the Hippo pathway and YAP1\nprotein, further promoting tissue regeneration. These discoveries hold promise for treating\nheart diseases and repairing other damaged tissues and systems [53] (Figure 4).\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n14 of 23\nFigure 4. Microgravity effects on stem cell differentiation and regenerative potential. This figure\nillustrates key findings related to the effects of microgravity on stem cell behavior. Microgravity has\nbeen associated with enhanced cell proliferation, potentially contributing to tissue repair processes.\nAdditionally, it leads to the temporary deactivation of the Hippo pathway, involving upstream\nregulators such as MST1/2, SAV1, WWC1-3, LATS1/2, and MOB1, which in turn promotes the\nnuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, microgravity influences hematopoietic stem cell\ndifferentiation by activating specific genes and pathways, including RUNX1, which is involved in\nstem cell establishment, SOX17, which plays a role in maintaining pluripotency, and GATA3, which is\ncrucial for megakaryocyte and erythrocyte maturation. The PI3K-Akt and mTOR pathways are also\nimplicated in this process, with STRIPAK acting as a modulatory factor.\nCells cultured under simulated microgravity using an RPM have shown significant\nalterations, enhancing our understanding of cellular responses to gravity loss. For example,\nthyroid carcinoma cells (FTC-133) formed three-dimensional spheroids, contrasting with\ntheir typical monolayer growth, and displayed changes in adhesion properties and internal\norganization consistent with spaceflight observations [23,24]. These morphological trans-\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n15 of 23\nformations involved cytoskeletal reorganization, particularly affecting actin filaments and\nmicrotubules, which are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity. Gene expression analysis\nrevealed changes in genes related to cellular adhesion and proliferation, including vascular en-\ndothelial growth factor (VEGF), E-cadherin, and vimentin. Moreover, T lymphocytes exposed\nto RPM-simulated microgravity exhibited decreased activation, mirroring the effects observed\nin spaceflight experiments. These findings validate the utility of RPMs for ground-based\nresearch on physiological changes relevant to long-duration spaceflight [24].\n6.1. Hematopoietic Differentiation\nSimulated microgravity significantly enhances the differentiation of human pluripo-\ntent stem cells into hematopoietic lineages, offering a promising avenue for regenerative\nmedicine and cell therapies [55–57]. Under microgravity conditions, hematopoietic stem\ncells demonstrate more efficient induction of endothelial hemogenic progenitors, leading\nto improved formation of functional three-dimensional structures. This results in a notable\nincrease in active hematopoietic cells, optimizing both cell expansion and differentiation\nprocesses [55–57].\nTranscriptomic analyses have identified the differential activation of thousands of\ngenes involved in hematopoiesis, including RUNX1, SOX17, and GATA1. RUNX1 is\nessential for establishing hematopoietic stem cells, SOX17 for maintaining pluripotency and\ndifferentiation into hematopoietic lineages, and GATA1 for the maturation of erythrocytes\nand megakaryocytes. These gene expression patterns suggest that microgravity creates a\nfavorable environment for optimizing hematopoiesis [55].\nAt the cellular level, microgravity influences DNA replication by promoting the ex-\npression of replication machinery genes such as helicases and polymerases. This enhances\nefficient cell division, a critical factor for hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differen-\ntiation. Furthermore, microgravity modulates the cell cycle, facilitating transitions through\nkey phases such as G1/S and G2/M, which are essential for cell proliferation [55–57].\nA key discovery is the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which regulates cell\ngrowth, survival, and metabolism. This pathway modulates proteins such as mTOR, which\ngoverns cell growth and metabolism, and Bad, which inhibits apoptosis, ensuring the\nsurvival of hematopoietic progenitor cells. By promoting cell proliferation and preventing\nprogrammed cell death, the PI3K-Akt pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of\nfunctional hematopoietic cells [56,57].\nMicrogravity also enhances three-dimensional cellular organization, improving inter-\nactions between cells and their microenvironment. These interactions are vital for forming\nhematopoietic niches that replicate physiological conditions more accurately. Cultures\nin microgravity favor the creation of three-dimensional spheroids, which support better\ndifferentiation and functionality of hematopoietic stem cells, optimizing the hematopoiesis\nprocess. This capability is particularly valuable for developing precise experimental models\nand innovative cell therapies [14,55,56].\nMicrogravity modulates hematopoiesis by influencing the differentiation, prolifera-\ntion, and structural organization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Pluripotent stem cells\nexhibit enhanced differentiation potential, increased proliferation, and improved structural\norganization, as microgravity optimizes conditions for hematopoietic progenitor expan-\nsion [17,58–62]. This occurs through survival signaling, primarily via PI3K-Akt pathway\nactivation, where increased Akt phosphorylation inhibits proapoptotic proteins such as\nBAD and enhances cell survival via antiapoptotic mechanisms linked to mTOR. Wnt/β-\ncatenin signaling is also dynamically regulated in microgravity, promoting β-catenin accu-\nmulation in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation, activating genes essential for stem\ncell self-renewal and differentiation. Additionally, microgravity modulates Notch path-\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n16 of 23\nway interactions and transcription factors like RUNX1, crucial for hematopoietic lineage\ncommitment. Structural rearrangements in hematopoietic niches under microgravity alter\ncell-to-cell interactions and adhesion molecule expression, facilitating the three-dimensional\norganization of hematopoietic clusters. On a physiological level, microgravity-induced\nmetabolic adjustments enhance responsiveness to hypoxic stimuli, promoting hematopoi-\netic maturation. These findings underscore the potential of microgravity-based systems\nto refine cell culture techniques and provide insights into spaceflight’s effects on human\nhematopoietic function [17,18].\n6.2. Cell Proliferation and Regenerative Therapies\nMicrogravity significantly influences cell proliferation and functionality, representing\na transformative advancement for biomedical research and regenerative medicine [63,64].\nIn studies with pancreatic islets and neural crest stem cells, exposure to microgravity\nnotably enhanced cell proliferation, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. For\ninstance, pancreatic beta cells exhibited a 45% increase in proliferation after two weeks of\nmicrogravity exposure compared to controls under normal gravity conditions [63,65].\nMicrogravity not only boosts cell growth but also modulates specific functions. For\nexample, pancreatic beta cells cultured under microgravity showed a significant increase in\ninsulin secretion, suggesting potential applications in developing therapies for metabolic\ndiseases such as diabetes [66]. Furthermore, co-culturing stem cells with pancreatic islets\nunder microgravity improved cell viability by 20%, highlighting its ability to create a\nfavorable environment for cell development [63,67].\nThe formation of three-dimensional structures under microgravity is a critical aspect\nof these improvements. Unlike two-dimensional cultures, 3D models more accurately repli-\ncate human physiological conditions, allowing for complex cell–cell and cell–environment\ninteractions essential for differentiation, proliferation, and functionality. Beta cells in 3D\nmodels not only proliferated more rapidly but also maintained enhanced functionality, as\ndemonstrated by increased insulin secretion [63,66].\nAt the molecular level, microgravity appears to modulate key signaling pathways,\nsuch as PI3K-Akt and mTOR, which regulate cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism.\nWhile further studies are needed to confirm their specific roles in beta cells and neural\ncrest stem cells, these findings underscore microgravity’s ability to influence fundamental\nprocesses and optimize cell culture conditions [63,65].\nMicrogravity offers a unique environment that enhances cell proliferation, viability,\nand functionality in 3D models, with direct applications in regenerative medicine. This\nenvironment not only promotes cell growth but also improves the functional quality of cells,\nwhich can significantly advance the development of cell therapies. For instance, pancreatic\nislets cultured under microgravity conditions could exhibit superior efficacy in transplants\nfor diabetes patients, demonstrating increased proliferation and functional capacity, which\ncould greatly enhance therapeutic outcomes [63,67].\n7. Impact on Pathogen Virulence\nMicrogravity, whether experienced during spaceflight or simulated in terrestrial mod-\nels, induces significant changes in the genetic expression and physiology of pathogens\naffecting both humans and plants. These changes have profound implications for astronaut\nhealth, space exploration, and the prevention of foodborne illnesses in space environ-\nments [15,68,69].\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n17 of 23\n7.1. Increased Pathogen Virulence and Resistance\nUnder microgravity conditions, bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and\nEscherichia coli exhibit increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, stress tolerance, and biofilm\nformation. This is often accompanied by a reduced median lethal dose (LD50) in animal\nmodels. For instance, Salmonella Typhimurium cultured under simulated microgravity\ndemonstrated fivefold higher lethality in mice compared to cultures grown under normal\ngravity. Additionally, these pathogens have been observed to evade and suppress plant\ninnate immunity, enabling colonization of intracellular spaces. While these processes are\nalso observed on Earth, it remains unclear whether microgravity enhances these capabilities\nor merely facilitates their study [15,16].\n7.2. Molecular Mechanisms Driving Virulence\nMicrogravity alters extracellular nutrient transport and activates molecular pathways\nthat enhance bacterial virulence. A key factor is low fluid shear, a physical stimulus that\nmimics microgravity environments and is also present in human microenvironments such\nas the gastrointestinal tract. Low fluid shear conditions favor the expression of stress\ntolerance and virulence-related genes, including those linked to the type III secretion\nsystem (TS3) and iron metabolism regulation. For example, Salmonella Typhimurium ex-\nposed to microgravity shows increased tolerance to acidic conditions and upregulation\nof genes controlled by Fur, a critical regulator of iron acquisition and virulence in enteric\npathogens [15,68,69].\n7.3. Effects on Biofilm Formation and Stress Response\nMicrogravity also influences the transport of oxygen and phosphates due to the\nabsence of convection, replicating conditions similar to those in human infections. These\nenvironmental changes impact gene expression related to stress tolerance and virulence. For\ninstance, Escherichia coli demonstrates enhanced biofilm formation and increased expression\nof genes responsible for host cell adherence and lesion formation, thereby amplifying its\npathogenic potential. However, these effects are not universal; variations in results suggest\nthat the impact of microgravity depends on the pathogen type, culture medium, and\nspecific experimental conditions [15,16].\nA recurring observation across multiple studies is the decreased expression of Hfq,\na key regulatory protein involved in stress response and virulence. Hfq plays a critical\nrole in the adaptation of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens under stress\nconditions, including microgravity. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms involving\nHfq could provide insights into mitigating the risks of pathogen virulence during prolonged\nspace missions [15,16].\nMicrogravity significantly affects interactions between human pathogens and plants,\nincreasing bacterial virulence and compromising plant defense mechanisms. For example,\npathogens under microgravity conditions demonstrate an enhanced ability to suppress\nplant immune responses, facilitating colonization and intracellular persistence [53–57].\nThese effects underscore the importance of investigating pathogen behavior in extreme\nconditions to develop strategies that mitigate health risks in space environments [15,16].\n8. Discussion\nRecent research demonstrates that microgravity significantly influences a wide array\nof biological processes, including immune responses, cell proliferation, and tissue regenera-\ntion. This unique environment disrupts key mechanisms such as mitochondrial biogenesis,\nliver metabolism, intestinal homeostasis, and stem cell differentiation, with profound\nimplications for human health, particularly during prolonged space travel (Table 1).\n\nInt.

Alterations\nin cellular biology under microgravity conditions have been shown to affect diseases\nsuch as cancer, osteoporosis, kidney dysfunction, and infertility. Additionally, changes\nobserved in endothelial cell behavior and multi-organ homeostasis highlight microgravity’s\npotential to revolutionize regenerative medicine and deepen our understanding of human\nphysiology in extreme environments.\nMicrogravity also holds significant promise for personalized medicine by facilitating\nprogress in regenerative therapies, immune-based treatments, and approaches to managing\nchronic diseases. These findings emphasize microgravity’s transformative potential to\nreshape cellular biology and its application to contemporary medical challenges, both in\nspace and on Earth.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n19 of 23\nAs a defining characteristic of space environments, microgravity imposes profound\nand multidimensional effects on biological and physiological systems, challenging con-\nventional notions of human adaptation. The near-total absence of gravitational forces\ndisrupts numerous bodily processes, posing risks to health during and after space missions.\nKey effects include fluid redistribution, increased intracranial pressure, muscle atrophy,\nand calcium-related bone density loss. At the molecular level, microgravity alters gene\nexpression, cell signaling, and mitochondrial function, with significant consequences for\nenergy production and cellular health [37–39].\nIn the immune system, microgravity reduces T cell activity and suppresses immune\nresponses, increasing susceptibility to infections. These effects highlight the necessity of\nmitigating immune dysfunction during space travel. Similarly, studies have documented\nchanges in the human microbiome, with potential implications for astronaut health and\nnutritional strategies during prolonged missions.\nMicrogravity research has also led to technological and medical breakthroughs with\napplications beyond space exploration. For instance, the study of proteins and drug\ncrystals under microgravity has produced purer and more stable structures, offering new\ntherapeutic possibilities for chronic diseases. Additionally, materials research in space has\ncontributed to the development of innovative compounds with applications in both space\nand terrestrial industries. These advancements enhance the safety and efficiency of space\nmissions while delivering broad scientific and technological benefits [39,40].\nDespite these advances, the complex effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity\nunderline the need for further research, particularly in anticipation of missions to Mars\nand other distant destinations. Experimental models, such as space platforms and terres-\ntrial simulators, remain indispensable tools for understanding the long-term impacts of\nmicrogravity and developing effective countermeasures [37,49].\nThe study of microgravity not only expands our understanding of how the human\nbody adapts to extreme environments but also drives innovations with profound implica-\ntions for science, medicine, and technology. By pushing the boundaries of what is known,\nthis research establishes itself as a cornerstone for advancements that extend beyond space\nexploration, reshaping our perspectives on biology and human health [37,40].\n9. Conclusions\nMicrogravity presents a unique and multifaceted challenge for human biology, pro-\nfoundly influencing cellular systems and physiological processes. This environment, dis-\ntinct from terrestrial conditions, disrupts key biological functions such as immune activity,\ncell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby destabilizing\nhomeostasis critical for human health.\nEmerging research has highlighted the diverse effects of microgravity, including its\nimpact on the immune system, where T cell function diminishes, increasing susceptibility to\ninfections. Additionally, cancer cells exhibit altered behavior under microgravity, providing\nnew insights into tumor progression and potential therapeutic approaches. These findings\nunderscore the need for further investigation into how microgravity influences disease\nmechanisms and treatment responses.\nMicrogravity also affects the physiology of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys,\nand bones, with implications for understanding tissue regeneration. Notably, stem cells\nexposed to microgravity demonstrate enhanced potential to produce mature, functional\ncells such as cardiomyocytes, offering transformative possibilities in regenerative medicine\nfor repairing damaged cardiac tissue and other applications.\nThe continued exploration of microgravity’s effects is essential not only for safeguard-\ning astronaut health during prolonged space missions but also for advancing therapeutic\n\nInt.

Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are\nassociated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceﬂight on\ncardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceﬂight\nalters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to\ncardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceﬂight. Mice were exposed to spaceﬂight for\n15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h\npost-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and\nTrp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered\nafter spaceﬂight. Spaceﬂight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1\nand downregulated Ptgs2, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes.\nSpaceﬂight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc,\nand downregulated the inﬂammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related\ngenes such as Trp53. Spaceﬂight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle\nand senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceﬂight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction\ndue to oxidative stress.\nKeywords: spaceﬂight; microgravity; heart; gene expression; oxidative stress; Nfe2l2; NADPH\noxidase; Ptgs2; Cdkn1a; Myc\n1. Introduction\nResponses to spaceﬂight include cardiovascular deﬁcits, loss of bone and muscle mass,\ncompromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [1–3].\nWith future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for\nlonger periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better\nunderstanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space\nenvironment is needed.\nEntering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body ﬂuids which leads to\nincreased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a ﬂuid\nshift between the vasculature and interstitium [4–6]. The ﬂuid shift invokes compensatory\nendocrine and renal mechanisms [6]. These alterations can diminish the capability of the\nheart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to\northostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts [7].\nGravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [8],\ndespite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space\nStation (ISS). Both spaceﬂight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for\nhuman spaceﬂight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [9,10].\nA reduction in myocardial interstitial ﬂuid may contribute to lower myocardial mass\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22169088\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n2 of 16\nfollowing microgravity exposure [11]. In rodents, 14 days of spaceﬂight was reported to\nreduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac\natrophy [12]. In contrast, spaceﬂight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [13], although\nit is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb\nunloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported\nto cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [14,15], but not in others [13], thus further work\nin this area is needed.\nIn addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose\nastronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and\nvascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [16–18]. In fact,\nspaceﬂight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related\nto metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and\nanimals [19–27]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in\nspace, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative\nstress-related pathways are not yet understood.\nActivation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major\nstress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental\nchallenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Spaceﬂight can alter expression of various cell\ncycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes [28,29] including CDKN1A (also known as P21),\na cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions\nand apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1A/P21 is a negative regulator of tissue\nregeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master\ntranscriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Spaceﬂight elevates Cdkn1a expression\nin bone tissue [30], liver and kidney [31] as well as cultured cells [29], implicating activation\nof CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment.\nWe hypothesized that spaceﬂight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell\ncycle/apoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used the-\nmatic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative\nstress and cell cycle/apoptosis (Trp53) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to\n15 days of spaceﬂight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression ﬁndings\nin heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including\nthose related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, inﬂammation and DNA damage\nrepair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration\nspaceﬂight.\n2. Results\n2.1. Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight\nImmediately after landing, all ﬂight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control mice were deter-\nmined to be in good condition by veterinary examination. Figure 1 shows the schematic\nof the experiment design and workﬂow. The average weight loss of FLT mice over the\nduration of the experiment was 2.0 g (−9.1%, SD = 2.1 g, p = 0.013) whereas GRD control\nmice lost an average of 0.7 g (−3.4%, SD = 0.9 g, p = 0.096); the difference in body weight\nloss averages for FLT versus GRD was not signiﬁcant (p = 0.143). FLT habitats showed\nan average of 10% less food remaining, and 24% less water remaining than GRD habitats.\nHowever, measured values for food and water utilization after ﬂight may not precisely\nreﬂect actual consumption by mice due to possible differences in food breakdown and\nwater spillage in FLT versus GRD habitats.\n2.2. Spaceﬂight Altered Expression of Oxidative Stress Related Genes\nComparable quantities (average of 38.5 µg RNA per tissue sample) and high qualities\nof total RNA were obtained from all the FLT and GRD samples. To determine if spaceﬂight\naltered the expression of genes regulating redox balance in cardiac tissue, oxidative stress\nPCR array was performed on 84 genes related to oxidative metabolism (Supplementary\nTable S1), and this data set was supplemented with real time PCR analysis of Nfe2l2\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n3 of 16\nexpression levels (Figure 2). Gene expression levels of FLT and GRD controls showed a\ntrend towards upregulation of a majority of those genes which were altered by spaceﬂight\n(Table 1). Out of the 84 genes on the array, 11 genes were upregulated and 3 genes were\ndownregulated in FLT samples relative to GRD (p < 0.05) (Table 1).\nFigure 1.

Expression\nlevels are represented as fold regulation in spaceﬂight versus ground controls (FLT versus GRD).\nShown are 14 differentially regulated genes out of a panel of 84 genes related to the oxidative stress\nresponse as measured by RT-PCR. Of these, 11 were upregulated while three were downregulated.\nThe change in expression levels of these genes were found to be statistically signiﬁcant by Mann–\nWhitney U test at p < 0.05, n = 4.\nGene Symbol\nGene Name\nFold Regulation\nNox1\nNADPH oxidase 1\n6.62\nTpo\nThyroid peroxidase\n2.35\nSlc41a3\nSolute carrier family 41, member 3\n1.97\nTxnip\nThioredoxin interacting protein\n1.94\nPrnp\nPrion protein\n1.44\nTxnrd3\nThioredoxin reductase 3\n1.43\nGsr\nGlutathione reductase\n1.31\nPrdx6\nPeroxiredoxin 6\n1.23\nCat\nCatalase\n1.20\nXpa\nXeroderma pigmentosum,\ncomplementation group A\n1.18\nSod1\nSuperoxide dismutase 1, soluble\n1.18\nNcf2\nNeutrophil cytosolic factor 2\n−1.49\nFancc\nFanconi anemia, complementation\ngroup C\n−1.62\nPtgs2\nProstaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2\n−3.44\nSpeciﬁcally, there was a marked 6.6-fold upregulation in expression of NADPH ox-\nidase 1 (Nox1), suggesting an increase in production of superoxide and/or hydrogen\nperoxide. Additionally, expression of Prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 (Ptgs2),\nwhich acts as peroxidase, was downregulated by 3.4-fold. The upregulation of Nox1 and\ndownregulation of Ptgs2 may reﬂect elevated oxidative stress within heart tissue of FLT\nmice relative to GRD controls. In addition, Txnip was upregulated by 1.9-fold and Fancc\nwas downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT samples. Ncf2, which codes for a component of the\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n4 of 16\nNADPH oxidase complex that generates superoxide, was moderately downregulated by\nspaceﬂight (−1.5-fold). Other antioxidant genes (Sod1, Cat, Prdx6, Gsr, Tpo, Txnrd3, Slc41a3)\nand oxidative stress-responsive genes (Xpa, Prnp) were moderately affected by spaceﬂight\n(1.2-2.4 fold, p < 0.05) (Table 1). There were no changes in the expression levels of 12 genes\nrelated to oxygen transport (Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, there was a 2.4-fold\nreduction in expression of the global transcription factor, Nfe2l2, in FLT compared to GRD\nanimals (Figure 2). Thus, the expression of redox-related genes was differentially regulated\nas a consequence of exposure to the spaceﬂight environment.\nFigure 2.

The log2 (linear) normalized\nexpression from the Ground Control and Flight groups were used in the Mann–Whitney U test.\n2.3. Spaceﬂight Altered Expression of Cell Cycle/Proliferation Related Genes\nThe expression levels of 84 genes involved cell cycle and apoptosis signal transduction\nwere analyzed by p53 Signaling Pathway PCR array (Supplementary Table S2). Out of\n84 genes, 13 genes were upregulated and 10 genes were downregulated in FLT compared\nto GRD controls (Table 2, p < 0.05). Results show that genes related to cell cycle regulation\nwere altered due to spaceﬂight. Speciﬁcally, cell cycle inhibitors such as Cdkn1a were up-\nregulated 6.8-fold while Cdk1 was downregulated 4.1-fold, suggesting diminished growth\nand proliferation signals in FLT samples compared to GRD. Myc was upregulated 3.9-fold\n(p < 0.05). Genes involved in inﬂammatory responses, including Tnf, Tnfrsf10b (Tnf receptor\nsuperfamily, member 10) and Traf1, were downregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease,\nrespectively) in spaceﬂight samples. Out of the 14 genes analyzed for DNA damage repair,\nfour genes were modestly upregulated (Atr, Xrcc5, Ercc1, Apex1; 1.1–1.3-fold) (Table 2,\np < 0.05). There were no signiﬁcant changes in apoptosis-related genes including Trp53,\nBax, Bcl2, Casp2 or Casp9 (Supplementary Table S2).\n2.4. Gene Networks and Disease Predictions\nWe made use of a computational approach to gain insight into possible protein–protein\ninteractions among the differentially expressed genes. Analysis using String Db revealed\npotential interactions between the oxidative stress response and Trp53 pathways (Figure 3).\nA number of oxidative stress response DEGs formed a molecular interaction network\nincluding Nox1 and Sod1 with Catalase serving as a central node. DEGs from the Trp53\nsignaling pathway also formed molecular interaction networks involving cell cycle-related\ngenes and transcription factors. For the Trp53 pathway, Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdkn1a and Atr served\nas central nodes in a molecular network that included Chek2, Fancc, Ercc1, Xrcc5 and Xpa1\namong others. Interestingly, the oxidative stress response and Trp53 pathways were linked\nby central nodes FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a, all of which code for major transcriptional\n\nInt. J. Mol.

Shown are 23 differentially regulated genes out of a panel of 84 genes related to the Trp53\nsignaling pathways as assessed by RT-PCR. Out of these, 13 genes were upregulated and 10 genes\nwere downregulated.

Discussion\nOur ﬁndings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level\nto the novel environment of space. Spaceﬂight experiments using rodents present unique\npractical challenges though similar beneﬁts to rodent studies on Earth. The animals ﬂown\nin space during this particular mission were deemed healthy, as assessed by veterinary ex-\namination after return to Earth, and the ﬁnding that animal body weights were comparable\nin FLT mice compared to GRD controls at the termination of the study. Further, numerous\nscientiﬁc reports from these mice describe related results obtained studying other organ\nsystems (e.g., [30,32,33]). The RNA samples recovered from the hearts were consistent and\nof high quality. Therefore, we conclude that the results we obtained from this mission\nwere valid.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n7 of 16\nWhereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of\ncardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited [12,13,34–36]. Goldstein et al. [12] re-\nport that spaceﬂight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes\nin rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac\natrophy. Short duration (6 days) spaceﬂight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of\nthe mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of\nmitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle [34]. More\nrecently, long duration spaceﬂight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation-\nrelated genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly,\nlifetime exposure of Drosophila to microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dys-\nfunction, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities [36]. Furthermore, spaceﬂight\ncauses cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression proﬁle consistent\nwith early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the\ncell cycle [37]. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related\ngenes provides novel ﬁndings on how the heart responds to spaceﬂight at the tissue level.\n3.1. Oxidative Stress-Related Gene Expression in Spaceﬂight Heart\nRT-PCR array data show that expression levels of 14 genes were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05)\naltered (11 upregulated and 3 downregulated) in FLT samples as compared to GRD controls.\nIn addition, RT-PCR analysis for Nfe2l2 revealed lower levels in FLT mice than GRD. Nfe2l2\nis a master transcriptional regulator for oxidative stress response genes, and is rapidly\ntranscribed within seconds following changes in the gravity vector [23]. Other tissues\nalso display reduced Nfe2l2 expression levels in similar spaceﬂight experiments entailing\ntissue recovery after landing [38]. Suzuki et al. recently demonstrated that long duration\nspaceﬂight activates Nfe2l2-dependent oxidative stress pathways in several tissues of\ngrowing mice [39]. Furthermore, Nfe2l2-deﬁcient mice are protected from spaceﬂight-\ninduced oxidative stress-related genes and changes in body weight [39], and also display\naccelerated transition of muscle ﬁber type without protecting from atrophy [40].\nWe also found that spaceﬂight upregulated Nox1 6.6-fold, the change of greatest\nmagnitude in oxidative stress-related genes observed in our study. NOX1 belongs to\nthe NADPH oxidase family of enzymes and functions in generating ROS in a highly\nregulated fashion [41,42]. NOX1 utilizes NADPH as an electron donor and catalyzes\ntransfer of electrons to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Superoxide\nradicals are short lived and are readily converted into hydrogen peroxide. Thus, increased\nexpression of Nox1 can cause an increase in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) [41,42]. NADPH oxidases are major sources of ROS in\nthe vascular system and are involved in the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular\ndiseases such as hypertension and myocardial infarction [43]. Several recent studies\nusing ground-based models to simulate weightlessness show that hindlimb unloading\ncauses cardiac atrophy, reduces cardiomyocyte size and cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by\nfractional shortening [14]. Inhibition of NOX1 by apocynin (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor)\nreduces oxidative stress markers in the heart, and mitigates atrophy and dysfunction in\nhindlimb unloaded mice, suggesting that Nox1 plays an important role in mediating cardiac\nresponses to simulated weightlessness [44]. Thus, our results support the hypothesis\nthat increased expression of Nox1 during spaceﬂight contributes to oxidative stress and\nmyocardial abnormalities.\nOxidative stress PCR array results showed lower expression of Ptgs2 by 3.4-fold in\nFLT samples compared to GRD. PTGS2, also known as Cycloxygenase 2 (COX2), is the\nkey, inducible enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts as both a dioxygenase and\nas a peroxidase, converting hydrogen peroxide into water. Thus, lower Ptgs2 expression\ncan lead to inefﬁcient removal of hydrogen peroxide, accumulation of ROS and oxidative\ndamage. PTGS2 is important for the maintenance of healthy cardiac tissue. Conditional\ncardiomyocyte-speciﬁc deletion of the Ptgs2 gene in adult mice reduces cardiac output,\ndecreases exercise tolerance and increases susceptibility to induced ventricular arrhyth-\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n8 of 16\nmias [45]. Furthermore, human and animal models of myocardial diseases show that\nPtgs2 expression is associated with cardiac tissue damaged by infarction, septicemia and\ninﬂammatory heart diseases [46]. In addition to inﬂammation, the prostaglandin pathway\nplays an important role in mechanical signaling. In cultured cells activated by serum, space-\nﬂight prevents induction of Ptgs2 expression, which is avoided by on-orbit centrifugation\nto replace the gravity vector, implicating sensitivity to a biomechanical mechanism for\nmicrogravity-induced activation of the prostaglandin pathway [47]. Inhibition of PTGS2\nalso impairs recovery of skeletal muscle and bone from hindlimb unloading [48,49]. Thus,\nregulation of the prostaglandin pathway by spaceﬂight via changes in Ptgs2 expression\nmay contribute to both oxidative stress and subsequent recovery on Earth.\nTxnip was upregulated 1.9-fold and Fancc was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT com-\npared to GRD, which also may contribute to a pro-oxidative milieu in the heart during\nspaceﬂight. TXNIP is a negative regulator of thioredoxins (TRXs) [50], which are potent\nantioxidants, and their downregulation by elevated Txnip expression in FLT samples may\nlead to increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. In cultured human endothelial cells\n(HUVEC), Txnip was the most upregulated by spaceﬂight (33-fold) [51]. Fancc codes for\nan antioxidant and its downregulation can cause sensitivity to oxidative stress-mediated\ndamage to tissue [52].\nOur results indicated moderate changes in several antioxidant genes (Sod1, Cat, Prdx6,\nGsr, Tpo, Txnrd3, Slc41a3) and other oxidative stress-responsive genes (Xpa, Prnp) (1.2–2.4-fold,\np < 0.05) (Table 1). The observed elevated expression levels of these antioxidant genes may\nbe due to activation of compensatory mechanisms.\nAlthough the magnitude of differences between FLT and GRD for statistically signiﬁ-\ncant genes were generally modest, together, the ﬁndings suggest that spaceﬂight activates\na network of genes responsible for redox signaling and defense against oxidative stress in\nthe heart.\n3.2. Cell Cycle and Senescence-Related Gene Expression in Spaceﬂight Heart\nIncreased generation of ROS during spaceﬂight can lead to protein, lipid and DNA\ndamage in tissue and, as is the case with skeletal muscle, may contribute to dysfunction\ncaused by gravitational unloading. ROS are also involved in vital cell signaling pathways\nsuch as cell-cycle progression, differentiation, inﬂammation and apoptosis. Cell cycle\nprogression in eukaryotes is regulated at various checkpoints by the action of speciﬁc cyclin\ndependent kinases (CDKs). The activities of these CDKs are controlled by the positive\nregulation from cyclins and negative regulation from cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors\n(CDKIs). Hence, expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, inﬂammation,\nDNA damage repair and apoptosis were further analyzed in hearts by p53 Signaling PCR\narray. The p53 Signaling PCR array includes 24 genes involved in cell cycle regulation.\nResults indicate that nine of these genes were signiﬁcantly altered in FLT samples.\nWe found spaceﬂight increased Cdkn1a/p21 expression 6.8-fold in hearts compared\nto GRD, consistent with reports for other tissues including liver, kidney, bone and mus-\ncle [27,30,31]. CDKN1A (also known as P21), is a potent CDK inhibitor and inhibits cell\ncycle progression at the G1 phase by inhibiting the activity of CDK2 or CDK4. Increases\nin p21 levels in bone from mice in this spaceﬂight experiment spaceﬂight were previously\nassociated with proliferative arrest in cultured osteoprogenitors [30]. However, the adult\nmammalian heart itself has limited regenerative ability. Adult p21 levels in adult heart\nare thought to contribute to normal cell cycle arrest in differentiated cardiomyocytes, and\nthere is evidence that cardiomyocytes can divide in the adult human heart [53], though\nit is unlikely that such a small sub-population (1.3% of total) [53] can account for our\nﬁndings. More likely, the elevation in p21 caused by spaceﬂight may contribute to car-\ndiomyopathies [54] via other cellular processes such as DNA repair, autophagy [38,55,56]\nand senescence. Interestingly, Myc, a mitogenic transcription factor gene that promotes\ncardiac hypertrophy in response to Angiotensin II, was also highly upregulated in the\nspaceﬂight heart samples we studied, and its deleterious action can be rescued by p21\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n9 of 16\nre-expression in p21-null mice [57]. Finally, in newborn mammals, p21 elevation might\ninterfere with cardiomyocyte binucleation, an important heart growth mechanism during\npost-natal development [58].\nPTTG1 (Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1) regulates the cell cycle by inducing\ncyclin D3 and repressing p21 expression [59]. Thus, a decrease in Pttg1 expression (2.4-fold)\nobserved in FLT samples may contribute to the observed increase in expression of p21 in\nFLT samples. In addition to upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors, CDK’s and cyclins such as\nCdk1 and Cdk4 were downregulated in FLT samples, implicating an overall cell cycle arrest\nin spaceﬂight samples.\nOur results also indicate some apparently contradictory ﬁndings, such as the expres-\nsion levels of genes for cell cycle arrest proteins, Chek2 and Btg2, were decreased 2.2- and\n3.5-fold, respectively in FLT samples, contrary to what is expected for Chek2 when Myc is\noverexpressed based on what is observed in lymphoma cells [60].\nThus, one of the crucial ﬁndings of our study is that spaceﬂight alters the expression\nlevels of major cell cycle and cell growth regulators. As the samples analyzed consist\npredominantly (but not solely) of fully differentiated non-dividing cardiomyocytes, this\nsuggests that spaceﬂight activates p21- and Myc-related pathways to regulate cell growth,\ncardiomyocyte function, and potentially cardiomyopathy, although complex interactions\nsuch as these remain to be elucidated.\n3.3. Apoptosis and DNA Damage Repair-Related Gene Expression in Spaceﬂight Hearts\nThere were no signiﬁcant changes in apoptosis-related genes such as p53, Bax, Bcl2,\nCasp2 or Casp9 (Supplementary Table S2). DNA damage repair genes such as Atr, Xrcc5,\nErcc1 and Apex1 were only moderately altered in spaceﬂight (1.1- to 1.3-fold), suggesting\nwidespread DNA damage responses were not occurring at the time of sample recovery.\nHowever, we cannot rule out the possibility that spaceﬂight activates DNA damage and\napoptosis pathways in a smaller sub-population of cell types within the heart during\nspaceﬂight, as shown previously for exposure to low dose, heavy ion radiation (16O,\n600 MeV/n) simulating space radiation [61]. Evidence supporting the possibility that\nspaceﬂight activates DNA damage pathways and/or apoptosis has been reported for\ntissues other than heart [62], including the thymus [63,64] and the eye [62,64], and multi-\nomics analyses reveal increased levels of DNA damage markers in urine and blood from\nastronauts [26].\n3.4. Inﬂammatory Pathway Gene Expression in Spaceﬂight Heart\nInﬂammatory response genes, such as Tnf (tumor necrosis factor), Tnfrsf10b (Tnf re-\nceptor superfamily, member 10) and Traf1 (Tnf receptor-associated factor) were signiﬁcantly\ndownregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease) in FLT samples compared to GRD controls.\nTnf is a multifunctional pro-inﬂammatory cytokine, which regulates a wide variety of\nbiological processes such as inﬂammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cyto-\ntoxicity [65]. Space is a hazardous environment and proper immune functioning is crucial\nfor astronaut health and success of space missions. The decreased expression of Tnf, Tn-\nfrsf10b and Traf1 observed in our study suggests downregulation of this pro-inﬂammatory\nsignaling pathway, which may lead to compromised immune function. Our results are\nconsistent with other studies showing spaceﬂight reduces Tnf expression levels in both\nmice [19,66] and humans [67]. In addition, human T cell cultures on the International Space\nStation (ISS) show a 15-fold decrement in expression of Tnf in T cells and its downstream\neffectors in microgravity as compared to cells centrifuged at 1g [68]. During a very long\nduration spaceﬂight, TNFα expression in the blood of astronauts is elevated [24] but after\nreturn to Earth (between days 0 and 5) as skeletal muscle enters a recovery phase, Tnfα\nexpression rapidly declines along with other cytokines in the Il6 pathway [69]. Together,\nthese ﬁndings implicate a biomechanical, gravity-dependent mechanism for regulating\nTnf-related pathways.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n10 of 16\nAlthough the radiation exposure of mice on the STS-131 mission is considered too\nlow to account for our results, relatively low doses of particle radiation (<30 cGy) can lead\nto altered regulation of disease-related pathways and deﬁcits in cardiac function [70,71].\nFurthermore, expression of oxidative stress and inﬂammation markers in the heart caused\nby low dose gamma radiation exposure is exacerbated when combined with hindlimb\nunloading [17]. Further study is needed to determine the inﬂuence of space radiation in\ncombination with microgravity, on the heart in the spaceﬂight environment during long\nduration missions.\n3.5. Gene Networks and Molecular Signatures of Disease\nComputational analysis revealed that changes in a subset of genes that were differen-\ntially expressed due to spaceﬂight were linked to disease, including immune suppression\nand impairments in glucose homeostasis, consistent with ﬁndings in astronauts [72,73].\nIn addition, a subset of the DEGs resulting from spaceﬂight were associated with cardio-\nvascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular decompensation, hyperten-\nsive disease and myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular decompensation and volumetric\nchanges in blood ﬂow were consistent with previous observations in crew members dur-\ning ﬂight [3,8,74]. In a previous study on a subset of ISS crewmembers, mean arterial\npressures reportedly do not change signiﬁcantly during spaceﬂight. However, cardiac\noutput and stroke volume are increased in ﬂight compared to the seated position on Earth\n(although comparable to the supine position on Earth) [3]. Thus, our ﬁndings were con-\nsistent with previous reports on astronauts indicating that spaceﬂight adversely affects\ncardiovascular health.\nComputational analyses also indicated that spaceﬂight led to altered regulation of\nmolecular networks within the oxidative damage response and cell proliferation path-\nways. Our ﬁndings suggest that oxidative stress and Trp35 signaling pathways were linked\nand that spaceﬂight alters gene interactions between these two pathways. Furthermore,\ntranscription factors FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a were predicted to mediate the interaction\nbetween these two pathways, making these genes promising targets for mitigating gene\nnetwork changes in response to spaceﬂight. Cat, Cdkn1a, Cdk1 and Cdk4 also were pre-\ndicted to serve as central hubs of gene networks that are altered by spaceﬂight. Hence,\nthese molecules may be potential targets for the development of countermeasures against\nspaceﬂight-induced tissue deﬁcits.\n3.6. Limitations\nFor extrapolation of ﬁndings from this murine study to humans, there is the inherent\nlimitation of the difference in species as well as a potential inﬂuence of the speciﬁc strain\nand sex which were selected as subjects. Factors related to experimental protocol also\nimportant to consider when interpreting gene expression ﬁndings from this experiment\ninclude the ﬁxed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were\nreturned to Earth (3+ hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were\nhoused in ﬂight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the ﬂight mice\nencountered during launch and landing. Therefore, observed changes in gene expression\ndid not solely reﬂect changes observed during habitation in microgravity, but for rapidly\nresponding genes, such as Nfe2l2, also may reﬂect re-entry and re-adaptation to 1-gravity\non Earth, however brieﬂy.\nAs the scope of our investigation focused on RT-PCR, additional studies are needed\nto elucidate how spaceﬂight-induced oxidative stress may mediate cell cycle/growth\nand function, to gain deeper insight into how the cardiovascular system responds to the\nspace environment and recovers after return to Earth. Furthermore, because the heart\nconsists of multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells, and\nmacrophages, each with a discrete gene expression proﬁle [53], future experiments could\nfocus on spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular source of speciﬁc gene expression\nchanges, as well as the regulation of protein expression together with cardiac function.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n11 of 16\n4. Materials and Methods\n4.1. Ethics Statement\nAll animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines described by\nthe National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and\napproved by all relevant committees, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee (IACUC) at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames\nResearch Center. The IACUC approval number associated with this animal study was\nNAS-10-002-Y1.\n4.2. Animals and Spaceﬂight\nThe mice in this study were ﬂown on the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131\nmission for the experiment “Mouse Antigen-Speciﬁc CD4+ T Cell Priming and Memory\nResponse during Spaceﬂight”. The heart tissue used in this experiment was an award\nto E. Almeida as part of the NASA STS-131 Mouse Immunology I Biospecimen Sharing\nProgram (BSP). Female C57BL/6J mice were acclimatized to spaceﬂight food bars and\nlixits, but were not placed in Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats until just before\nspaceﬂight. Mice were divided into two groups: ﬂight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control.\nThe NASA AEM units are composed of a stainless-steel grid cage, fan blowers, a layered\nﬁlter system, interior lamps, specialized food bars, and a water box. The AEM units are\nself-contained habitats that provide group housing with constant ad libitum access to food\nand water while also providing a waste management system that isolates the animals from\ntheir waste. FLT mice were launched at 14 weeks of age then ﬂown in space for 15 days\nand were not subjected to any experimental procedures during spaceﬂight.\nSynchronous GRD control mice were also housed in AEMs, maintained in an orbital\nenvironmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center, and exposed to environmental condi-\ntions matched closely to those of FLT mice on the shuttle (temperature, light/dark cycle,\nhumidity, and carbon dioxide levels). FLT and GRD control animals were weighed before\nﬂight and immediately after return and were subjected to veterinary examination prior to\neuthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group were measured upon recovery.\nAnimals were euthanized at 16 weeks of age starting approximately 3 h after landing using\nisoﬂurane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Euthanasia and dissections proceeded at\na pace of one mouse every 15–20 min. The heart was removed and major veins and feed\narteries trimmed off. The hearts of four mice per group were bisected into the cephalic\nand caudal regions, and the caudal halves (ventricles) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for\nlater analysis of gene expression (the remaining hearts from four mice per group were\ndistributed to another BSP investigator). The frozen samples were transported on dry ice\nto NASA Ames Research Center and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis.\n4.3. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis\nTotal RNA was isolated from frozen heart tissue by homogenization and RNA extrac-\ntion using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Tissue samples were\nhomogenized in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 min.\nAfter incubation, 0.2 mL of chloroform was added, the sample agitated vigorously for 30 s\nand then incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at\n12,000× g for 15 min at 4 ◦C. Following centrifugation, the upper aqueous phases were\nseparated and incubated with 0.5 mL of isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature. Sam-\nples were then centrifuged at 12,000× g for 15 min at 4 ◦C and the RNA pellet was washed\nwith 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 100 µL of nuclease-free water and\nfurther puriﬁed using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), per instructions.\nThe quantities and qualities of puriﬁed RNA were determined by measuring absorbance\nat 260 nm and 280 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc,\nWilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was assessed by running RNA on 0.8% agarose\nformaldehyde-denaturing gel with ethidium bromide and further visualized by Fluor-S\nMultimager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n12 of 16\nAll RNA samples were analyzed by thematic real time PCR arrays (for Oxidative\nStress and p53-related pathways) or RT-PCR (for Nfe2l2). Although whole transcriptome\nanalysis would be valuable, samples are no longer available for additional analyses.\n4.4. Quantitative Real-Time PCR Array\nAn equal amount of RNA (1 µg) was used from FLT and GRD samples to synthe-\nsize cDNA using RT2 PCR Array First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA).\nReal-time PCR was performed using the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and\np53 Signaling Pathway PCR Array (PAMM-027) according to the manufacturer’s protocol\n(SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Brieﬂy, FLT and GRD cDNA samples were mixed\nwith RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA) and dis-\ntributed across the 96-well plate array. Each of the 96-well plate arrays contained primers\nfor 84 genes related to oxidative stress or p53 signaling pathways and control housekeep-\ning genes (HKG). PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied\nBiosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with initial denaturation at 95 ◦C for 10 min, followed\nby 40 cycles of 95 ◦C for 15 s and 60 ◦C for one minute. FLT and GRD cDNA samples\nwere also run on control RT2 RNA QC PCR Array plates (PAMM-999) to test RNA quality,\nreverse transcription efﬁciency, PCR efﬁciency and genomic DNA contamination.\n4.5. Nfe2l2 Real-Time PCR\ncDNA was synthesized by using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Va-\nlencia, CA, USA). Brieﬂy, 1 µg of RNA sample was treated with gDNA Wipeout Buffer at\n42 ◦C for 2 min then reverse-transcription was performed using Quantiscript RT Buffer\nand Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase as per manufacturer’s instruction. The Real-Time\nPCR mixture was made using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,\nUSA). Synthesized cDNA from the previous step was mixed with Quantiscript SYBR Green\nPCR Mix and Nfe2l2 primer mixture, per manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR was\nperformed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)\nwith initial activation at 95 ◦C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 ◦C for 15 s and\n60 ◦C for 1 min. Ct values were retrieved by maintaining the same threshold among all\nthe samples.\n4.6. Data Analysis and Statistics\nFor the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and p53 Signaling Pathway PCR\nArray, relative expression levels of genes were calculated using the comparative threshold\ncycle method (∆∆Ct) with normalization to the average expression levels of ﬁve house-\nkeeping genes (SABiosciences Data Analysis Software). FLT samples were compared to\nGRD controls using Mann–Whitney U Test using p < 0.05 as the threshold of signiﬁcance\nand sample size of n = 4 mice per group.\nFor Nfe2l2 RT-PCR of heart samples, the change in expression levels were calculated\nusing the ∆∆Ct method with Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) 1 as house-\nkeeping gene. The log2 (linear) normalized expression from ﬂight and ground control\ngroups was used in the Mann–Whitney U test at p < 0.05, n = 4 mice per group.\n4.7. Gene Network Predictions and Functional Analysis\nTo generate predictions on potential protein interactions, statistically signiﬁcant differ-\nentially expressed genes from both PCR arrays were entered into the String DB protein-\nprotein interaction database [75]. Experimental evidence, databases, and co-expression\nwere used as sources to generate protein interaction networks. The interaction score was\nset to a threshold of “medium” (0.400).\nToppfun [76] was used to gain insight into whether the differentially expressed genes\nwere linked to human disease phenotypes. Statistically signiﬁcant differentially expressed\ngenes were entered into the Toppfun database. The results were ﬁltered using a Benjamini–\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n13 of 16\nHochberg false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of p < 0.05 and a query to genome overlap\nof four or more genes.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, our study revealed that spaceﬂight signiﬁcantly altered cardiac expres-\nsion of genes related to cell cycle/growth (notably Cdkn1a/p21, Cdk1, and Myc), inﬂamma-\ntion (notably Tnf) and oxidative stress (notably Nfe2l2, Nox1, Ptgs2), which may contribute\nto cardiac dysfunction. These ﬁndings provide novel data suitable for developing testable\nhypotheses for further study. Identiﬁcation of speciﬁc mechanisms and molecules responsi-\nble for excess ROS generation during spaceﬂight is of considerable interest, and may yield\nnew therapeutic approaches.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/\n10.3390/ijms22169088/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.K.G., E.A.C.A. and A.K.; data analysis, A.K. and\nC.G.T.T.; interpretation of results, R.K.G., E.A.C.A., A.K. and C.G.T.T.; writing—original draft prepa-\nration, A.K. and R.K.G.; writing—review and editing, R.K.G., E.A.C.A. and C.G.T.T.; supervision,\nR.K.G.; funding acquisition, R.K.G. and E.A.C.A.

This study assessed im-\nmune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep spaceﬂight con-\nditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station\nmissions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb un-\nloaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic\nrays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune proﬁling results revealed unique\nimmune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each\nstressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences\nfor deep spaceﬂight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed\ninvolvement in immune system dysregulation. Furthermore, a large astronaut\ncohort showed elevated inﬂammation during low-Earth orbit missions, thereby\nsupporting our simulated ground experiments in mice. Herein, circulating im-\nmune biomarkers are deﬁned by distinct deep space irradiation types coupled\nto simulated microgravity and could be targets for future space health initiatives.\nINTRODUCTION\nRecent studies indicate astronauts in low-Earth orbit (LEO), such as on the International Space Station (ISS),\nexperience immune dysfunction, for instance, redox imbalance, elevated inﬂammation, elevated granulo-\ncytes, inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, and reduced lymphocyte functions (Crucian et al., 2015; Douda\net al., 2015; Leliefeld et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2015; Mehta et al., 2017; Pecaut et al., 2017). However, less\nis known about the likely biological (immune system) consequences of deep space exploration.\nSolar particle event (SPE) and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) irradiation are charged particle ionizing types of\nradiation that will impact humans and spacecraft during lunar and deep spaceﬂight missions (Sridharan\net al., 2020). High doses of these types of charged ionizing radiation types do not typically pose a threat\nto Earth, as we are shielded by the Earth’s magnetosphere (Simonsen et al., 2020); however, astronauts\non future missions to the lunar surface and Mars will have limited shielding from these damaging irradia-\ntion. Although doses experienced in deep space do not parallel those of LEO manned missions, health\nrisks associated with LEO doses are still considerable. For instance, current missions in LEO, such as on\nthe ISS, experience a low total absorbed dose of irradiation, estimated to be exposed to approximately\n0.10–0.52 mGy/day, depending on the mission, as quantiﬁed by NASA GeneLab’s environmental data\nfor spaceﬂight experiments (Miller, 2020).\nSPE irradiation originates from protons being emitted during solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (Narici et al.,\n2018; Sanzari et al., 2015), and although the majority of the ions are protons at different energies during these\nevents, it can also include other ions such as helium and high- (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions (Hu,\n2017). Limited number of human reports following SPE irradiation exposure are associated with astronauts on\nLEO spacewalks and lunar missions from the Apollo era (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; Sanzari et al., 2013). The\nphysiological effects of SPE irradiation exposureinclude fatigue,acuteradiation sickness, long-termskindamage,\nelevated cytokine storms, and decreased blood and hemopoietic cell numbers (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; San-\nzari et al., 2013).\n1Universities Space Research\nAssociation, Columbia, MD\n21046, USA\n2Space Biosciences Division,\nNASA Ames Research\nCenter, Moffett Field, CA\n94043, USA\n3Department of Biomedical\nEngineering, Center for\nBiotechnology &\nInterdisciplinary Studies,\nRensselaer Polytechnic\nInstitute, Troy, NY 12180, USA\n4Department of Biological\nSciences, San Jose State\nUniversity, San Jose, CA\n95112, USA\n5Department of Preventive\nMedicine and Community\nHealth, University of Texas\nMedical Branch, Galveston,\nTX 77555, USA\n6NASA Johnson Space\nCenter, Houston, TX 77058,\nUSA\n7Department of\nNeurobiology/\nPharmacology, Morehouse\nSchool of Medicine, Atlanta,\nGA 30310, USA\n8Center for Radiological\nResearch, Columbia\nUniversity, New York, NY\n10027, USA\n9KBR, Space Biosciences\nDivision, NASA Ames\nResearch Center, Moffett\nField, CA 94043, USA\n10Lead Contact\n*Correspondence:\nafshin.beheshti@nasa.gov\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.\n2020.101747\niScience 23, 101747, December 18, 2020 ª 2020 The Author(s).\nThis is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\n1\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\n\nFigure 1. Immune Organs and Total Leukocyte Populations Display Disparities following Simulated Deep Space\nExposures\n(A) Experimental plan timeline: 15-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were cage acclimated for 3 days (day \u00013) before\nexperimental initiation (0). Mice were either normally loaded (NL, shaded) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, not shaded) for\n14 days. On day 13 mice were whole body irradiated with Sham (0 Gy, green), galactic cosmic rays (GCR, 0.5 Gy, blue),\nsolar particle events (SPE, 1 Gy, red), or gamma (5 Gy, yellow) irradiation types (formulas described in Methods). 24 h post-\nirradiation (day 14), mice were euthanized and blood and tissues were collected. Body weights were measured on days\n\u00013, 0, 7, and 14. Tissue weights were measured on collection day 14.\n(B–G) (B) Body weights were measured on days \u00013, 0, 7, and 14.

As the predicted dose for ISS missions, in the absence\nof SPE irradiation events, is 0.10–0.52 mGy/day (Miller, 2020), astronauts inLEO could therefore be exposedupto\na roughly estimated 0.1 Gy/year of irradiation. Moreover, during SPE events, astronauts could experience an\nextremely high dose of protons (Hu, 2017) possibly up to 1 Gy or more (Wu et al., 2009), which would pose sig-\nniﬁcant health risks. NASA estimates that the amount of GCR irradiation exposure during deep space missions\nmay be 0.3–0.6 mGy/day or more over a 3-year-long mission to Mars (0.245–0.360 Gy) (Nelson, 2016).\nLinear energy transfer (LET) is deﬁned as the amount of energy that is deposited or transferred in a material from\nan ion (Chancellor et al., 2018). High-LET irradiation can cause more damaging ionizing tracks and pose a higher\nrelative biological effectiveness (RBE) risk compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). How-\never, this does not rule out the composite effects of low-LET continuous dose/dose rate involved during space-\nﬂight (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2014), the effects of low LET inhibition of angiogenesis (Grabham\net al., 2013), or the range of cellular damage by low-LET particles (Nelson, 2016). RBE is the relative amount of\nbiological damage a dose of irradiation will have on tissue (Chancellor et al., 2018). Thus, identifying the immune\nresponses following distinct ionizing irradiation types, along with described dosing schemes, RBEs, and pro-\ntracted exposures, are essential for future exploration missions to the lunar surface and Mars.\nDue to limitations of performing deep space missions, there have been multiple ground-based research\nstudies examining the effects of ionizing irradiation on immunity. For instance, large disparities in immune\npopulation subtypes, in particular lymphocytes (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2017; Gridley and Pecaut, 2011;\nGridley et al., 2002; Romero-Weaver et al., 2013; Sanzari et al., 2013) and induction of inﬂammation (Baselet\net al., 2019; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2014; Teresa Pinto et al., 2016), have been reported.\nHowever, more information is required on the deep space-relevant spectra of irradiation effects on\nimmunity.\nWith recent advancements in simulated GCR and SPE dosing schemes at NASA’s Space Radiation Labo-\nratory (NSRL) within Brookhaven National Laboratory, the biological effects of realistic deep space expo-\nsures can now be successfully measured in ground-based studies (Simonsen et al., 2020). Therefore, our\nstudy sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated GCR and SPE\nirradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading, HU) in mice. We hy-\npothesized that unique immune signatures and microRNA (miRNA) proﬁles would be produced by distinct\nexperimental conditions of simulated GCR, SPE, and gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU.\nAlthough this study focuses on immune dysregulation during deep spaceﬂight, the knowledge gained from\nthese studies can be applied to related issues on Earth such as, cancer radiotherapy, muscle degeneration,\nand immune-related diseases.\nRESULTS\nSimulated Deep Space Exposures Selectively Caused Reduced Immune Organ Weight and\nTotal Leukocyte Populations\nMice were exposed to acute, 0.5-Gy simpliﬁed GCR simulation (GCR sim), 1-Gy SPE simulation (SPE sim), or\n5Gy gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (14-days total) and were weighed on days \u00013, 0, 7,\nFigure 1.

A Grubbs test was performed on all datasets followed by testing for normal distribution via a\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test. If data were normally distributed, a one-way ANOVA Dunnett test was performed to\ncompare NL and HU controls to all groups and a parametric unpaired t test with Welsh’s correction was performed to\ncompare between similar irradiation groups. If normality was not passed, both a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test\nwith a Dunn’s posthoc analysis to compare NL and HU controls with all groups and a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U\ntest comparing between similar irradiation groups were performed.

Gamma irradiation was included to calculate the RBE of GCR sim and SPE sim. As\ncharged particles generally have a higher RBE than photons (gamma irradiation) we used an elevated\ndose of 5 Gy. The results revealed signiﬁcant difference in body weight across GCR and SPE irradiation\ncombined with HU groups at 24 h post-irradiation exposures (i.e., day 14) (Figure 1B). Euthanasia was per-\nformed on day 14, and select immune organs were collected and weighed to determine if spaceﬂight ex-\nposures caused weight differences. Interestingly, all irradiation groups with HU had a signiﬁcant decrease\nin spleen weight, compared to NL-Sham controls with intergroup comparisons between GCR and gamma\n(Figure 1C). For the thymus, SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups were signiﬁcantly reduced in\nweight, along with both NL- and HU-gamma cohorts, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 1D). To\naddress whether there are fewer white blood cells (WBCs) circulating within blood, which may result in\nweight disparities in the immune organs, common leukocyte antigen (CD45), which labels all leukocytes,\nwas analyzed by ﬂow cytometry within the total doublet discriminated (DD) events (Figures 1E–1G). The re-\nsults showed reduced CD45+ circulating leukocyte populations within DD events following all exposures,\ncompared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 1F and 1G). Collectively, these results indicate that 24 h following\ncombined exposures, there are immune system decrements, in both primary (thymus; SPE irradiation) and\nsecondary (spleen; GCR and gamma irradiation) immune organs, which may be associated with reduced\ncirculating leukocytes.\nInnate Immune Proﬁles Revealed Distinct Populations following Simulated Deep Space\nExposures\nSubgroups of leukocytes were analyzed to determine the proﬁle of innate immune cells following 24 h of\nacute, simulated GCR, SPE, or gamma irradiation exposures, singly or in combination with HU (14 days).\nGating\nschemes\nwithin\nCD45+\nevents\ndisplayed\nneutrophils\n(Ly6ghighCD11b+),\neosinophils\n(Ly6glowCD11b+), monocytes (Ly6g\u0001CD11b+), B cells (CD20+NK1.1-/CD45+) (Figures 2A, 3A, and S1A–\nS1C), and NK/NKT cells (CD20\u0001NK1.1+/CD45+) (Figures 3A, 3C and S1D). The results revealed elevated\nneutrophil populations in HU-Sham, - SPE, and gamma irradiation in combination with HU groups,\ncompared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 2C). No signiﬁcant differences were seen between monocytes\n(Figure 2B) or neutrophils (Figure 2C) with GCR or SPE irradiation alone compared with NL-Sham controls.\nThere were no differences noted across all innate immune groups following GCR irradiation, singly or in\ncombination with HU (Figures 2B–2D and 3C). Interestingly, a signiﬁcant elevation in eosinophils (Figure 2D)\nand NK/NKT (Figure 3C) cells was observed in single SPE and gamma irradiation, that was suppressed in\ncombination with HU, which indicates SPE and gamma irradiation selectively targets these cell types\ncompared to NL-Sham controls. Moreover, these results also indicate suppressed inﬂammation in\nresponse to combination SPE and gamma irradiation with HU. Interestingly, gamma irradiation alone\ninduced all innate immune proﬁles, compared with NL-Sham controls, which was reduced in combination\nwith HU (Figures 2B–2D and 3C), indicating suppressed inﬂammation in gamma irradiation in combination\nwith HU. Collectively, these trends suggest that higher doses of ionizing irradiation may be more toxic,\ncausing heightened immunogenicity.\nAdaptive Immune Proﬁles Revealed Select B, T Helper, and T Cytotoxic Lymphocytes Are\nNegatively Impacted by Simulated Deep Space Exposures\nLymphocytes are sensitive to ionizing irradiation exposures, whereby irradiation initiates DNA damage\ntriggering apoptosis (Schaue and McBride, 2012). To assess the effects of deep space-relevant exposures\non lymphocyte proﬁles we ﬁrst assessed B cell populations. The gating scheme for B cells is displayed in\nFigure 3A. Although no difference was revealed for GCR irradiation alone, compared with NL-Sham con-\ntrols, all other irradiation groups, singly or in combination with HU resulted in signiﬁcant reduction of B\ncells, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 3B and S1E). These results suggest possible impairments\nin antibody-producing, plasma cell differentiation. To conﬁrm impaired B cell differentiation median ﬂuo-\nrescent intensity (MFI) of cell surface CD20 was assessed, as CD20 expression levels are reduced during B\ncell maturation into plasma cells (Robillard et al., 2014; Styles et al., 2017). There was no reduction in B cell\nsurface expression of CD20 (Figure 3C), suggesting B cell differentiation processes are impaired with GCR\nand SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with HU, compared with NL-Sham controls. T cell lineages\nwere also characterized by ﬂow cytometry in blood following space-relevant conditions, including T helper\n(Th, CD8\u0001CD4+/CD3+) and T cytotoxic (Tc, CD8+CD4-/CD3+) lymphocytes (Figure 4A). The results revealed\nGCR irradiation singly and in combination with HU signiﬁcantly reduced circulating Th and Tc lymphocytes,\ncompared to NL-Sham controls, whereas no signiﬁcant effects in T cell populations were observed with\ngamma irradiation (Figures 4B–4E). In addition, SPE irradiation exposures (single and combination groups)\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\n4\niScience 23, 101747, December 18, 2020\niScience\nArticle\n\nalso reduced Tc lymphocyte numbers (Figures 3C and 3E). Collectively, these results indicate impairment in\nB cell and effector/central memory T cell adaptive immune responses following deep space-relevant expo-\nsures, which can pose a major health risk limitation on future human exploration missions.\nLymphocyte Surface Expression of IL-7R Is Impacted by Simulated Deep Space Exposures,\nwith Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)\nTo assess the mechanisms involved in reduced T cell percentage, we characterized the cell surface expression of\nIL-7R on circulating lymphocytes (Figures 5A and 5B). IL-7R expression varies throughout T cell development,\nwhereby it is expressed on single-positive naive T cells, but not activated T cells, and then is re-expressed on\nmemory T cells (Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007). Furthermore, elevated IL-7R has been linked to multiple inﬂam-\nmatory diseases (Anderson et al., 2011; Belarif et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2012).

Il-6, another pro-inﬂammatory cytokine well known for its involvement in the acute phase\nresponse (Tanaka et al., 2014), was induced in HU, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 6C), suggest-\ning exposure to simulated microgravity may induce inﬂammation. Interestingly, GCR irradiation in combi-\nnation with HU resulted in Il-6 suppression (Figure 6C), supporting suppression of inﬂammation in com-\nbined deep space conditions of GCR irradiation and HU. Ifn-ɣ, is a cytokine produced by Tc cells, Th1\ncells, NK/NKT cells, and innate lymphoid cells-1 subtype-1 (ILC1) (Colonna, 2018). It has been associated\nwith NK cell activity (Lusty et al., 2017) and improved macrophage antigen presentation (Kak et al.,\n2018). We found in comparison to NL-sham controls, Ifn-g was signiﬁcantly upregulated in both GCR irra-\ndiation exposure groups, singly or combined with HU (Figure 6D). Furthermore, gamma irradiation resulted\nin increased expression of Ifn-g in combination with HU, compared with gamma irradiation alone (Fig-\nure 6D). IL-4 is typically produced by Th2 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and its primary role promotes\ncellular survival (Keegan and Zamorano, 1998). We found signiﬁcant fold elevation of Il-4 in all irradiation\ngroups in combination with HU, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figure 6E), suggesting this cytokine\nmay be critically involved in promoting cell survival in the remaining pool of cells following space-relevant\nexposures. Collectively, these results suggest unique cytokine signatures are produced following different\nsimulated deep space exposures.\nmiRNA Proﬁling Revealed A Relationship to Immune Dysfunction in Simulated Deep Space\nExposures\nmiRNAs are non-coding RNA interference molecules involved in silencing post-transcriptional gene\nexpression (O’Brien et al., 2018). Due to their important role in gene expression regulation (O’Brien\net al., 2018), contribution to immunity (Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009), and importance for therapeutic pur-\nposes (van Rooij and Kauppinen, 2014), we sought to assess the circulating miRNA proﬁle expressed in\nthe plasma following simulated deep space exposures. We focused on miRNAs in plasma, as we have\ndemonstrated that the immune system dysregulation is systemic and circulating (Beheshti et al., 2017,\nFigure 5.

To\ndetermine the overall impact that miRNAs have on the immune system, we ﬁrst predicted gene ontology\n(GO) terms with an false discovery rate < 0.05 from processed miRNA-sequenced plasma data for all con-\nditions and ﬁltered for speciﬁc immune GO terms (Figure 7). The GO immune terms were categorized by\nutilizing the GO Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) information for speciﬁc GO immune terms (Smith and\nEppig, 2009). An Upset plot (Figure S2) shows general up and down immune pathways in each listed con-\ndition and the overlapping pathways between conditions. Overall, majority of the immune pathways are\ndownregulated. Pathways related to humoral immune responses were the exception and predicted to\nbe upregulated due to miRNAs, as miRNAs in general can elevate humoral immunity (Danger et al.,\n2014; O’Connell et al., 2010). A more detailed analysis of the speciﬁc GO immune terms (Figure 7A) re-\nvealed speciﬁc pathways clustering together following speciﬁc irradiation exposures. We conﬁrmed this\npattern of immune dysregulation in deep space exposure groups in Hallmark pathways/gene sets (Liberzon\net al., 2015) regulated by miRNAs, which showed distinct patterns within each group (Figure 7B).\nFigure 6.

Although ionizing irradiation exposures in LEO are not at the same as doses\nexperienced in deep space, health risks associated with these doses are still considerable, and career\nlimiting. To characterize inﬂammation experienced on orbit, we re-purposed retrospective data from ISS\ncrewmembers participating in three experiments: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006–2012), Dietary\nIntake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery\n(Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Proﬁle (2013–2018). Subsets of these data have been previously pub-\nlished (Crucian et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2015).\nPro-inﬂammatory IL-1b and IL-1a and pleiotropic insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IL-1 receptor antag-\nonist (RA) were analyzed. The results showed that IGF-1 was induced at in-ﬂight day 15 and remained persis-\ntent through ﬂight and during post-ﬂight return (Figure 8 and Table S1). Cytokines IL-1b and IL-1a were also\ninconsistently elevated during ﬂight, compared with preﬂight, whereas both returned to pre-ﬂight levels\nupon return to Earth, suggesting ground readaptation (Figure 8). In addition, IL-1RA was also elevated\nin-ﬂight, and returned to pre-ﬂight baseline controls (L-45, Figure 8), indicating homeostatic inhibition of\nIL-1a and/or IL-1b may also be regulated in-ﬂight. As both pro-inﬂammatory IL-1a and IL-1b levels are\nFigure 7.

These studies, and others (Buchheim et al., 2019; Gar-\nrett-Bakelman et al., 2019), indicate that inﬂammation is induced in LEO, although mechanisms are also in\nplace to maintain homeostasis, which may also apply during missions beyond LEO.\nHerein, the results revealed that at 14 days post-HU and 1 day post-acute irradiation exposure, total body\nand immune organ (spleen and thymus) weights were reduced, which was accompanied by reduced total\nleukocytes in combination exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls. Most strikingly, reduced frequency\nof T effector lymphocytes (i.e., T helper, Th and T cytotoxic, Tc cells) and B lymphocytes in the presence of\ncombined conditions, compared to NL-Sham controls, were noted indicating the potential for impaired\nadaptive immunity. Furthermore, differential cytokine proﬁles were also characterized, which displayed\nthe potential for Th2 lineages to develop, while Gene Ontology (GO) and Hallmark terms determined by\ncirculating miRNAs displayed similar immune deviations in mice. Similarly, astronaut data revealed inﬂam-\nmation occurs in LEO missions, analogous to our ground-based results in mice. Collectively, these results\ndemonstrate that differential immune proﬁles are probable throughout the course of long-duration,\nexploratory missions in deep space and describe circulating immune biomarkers (i.e., select cell types\nand miRNAs) as potential therapeutic targets to regulate immunity.\nDISCUSSION\nUtilizing the recently developed simpliﬁed version of the NASA consensus formula of ﬁve different ions to\nsimulate GCR and SPE irradiation at NSRL, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune\neffects following acute simulated deep space exposures of ionizing irradiation, singly or in combination\nwith simulated microgravity in mice. We also sought to describe the contributing role of circulating miRNAs\non the immune proﬁle, as miRNAs have been identiﬁed as regulators of immunity (Baker et al., 2019;\nDanger et al., 2014; Mehta and Baltimore, 2016; Montagner et al., 2013; O’Brien et al., 2018; O’Connell\net al., 2010; Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009). Known effects of ionizing irradiation can cause immunogenic re-\nsponses (Baselet et al., 2019; Li et al., 2014; Teresa Pinto et al., 2016). Indeed, high-LET irradiation causes\nmore damaging tracks and elevates apoptosis, compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al.,\n2012). Yet, comprehensive immune studies on the effects of acute high- and low-LET irradiation are limited\n(Gridley and Pecaut, 2006). Therefore, characterizing immune proﬁles and circulating miRNAs following\ndistinct ionizing irradiation types are essential for successful missions to the lunar surface and Mars.\nFigure 8. Elevated Markers of Inﬂammation in Astronauts on 4- to 6-Month ISS Missions\nBlood samples were collected at launch minus (L-) 45 days, on Flight Day (FD)15, FD30, FD60, FD120, and FD180; post-\nﬂight samples were collected in the ﬁrst 24 h after landing and again 30 days later . Inﬂammatory markers were analyzed in\nplasma for IGF-1, IL-1b, IL-1a, and IL-1RA. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences\nduring and after ﬂight compared with preﬂight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t test.\nMultiple comparisons were accounted for. Data represent means G SEM (***p < 0.001, n = 59 crewmembers; 47 males, 12\nfemales). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2015).\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\niScience 23, 101747, December 18, 2020\n11\niScience\nArticle\n\nIn our study, both GCR and SPE irradiation exposures in the presence or absence of HU in mice caused a\nsigniﬁcant reduction in total leukocytes (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1), in particular Th and Tc cells (Figures 4B–\n4E). Whole body weights were signiﬁcantly reduced in GCR and SPE irradiation groups in combination with\nHU (Figure 1B) along with reduced spleen weights in GCR and gamma irradiation (Figure 1C), which may be\ndue to reduced circulating leukocytes (Figures 1F and 1G and S1). Furthermore, reduced thymus weights in\nHU combination groups with SPE irradiation (Figure 1D) implies reduced clonal diversity of lymphocytes\nduring deep space exposures, which can affect adaptive immune responses against future challenges. In\nline with this, miRNA immune GO terms revealed reduced spleen and thymus development following all\nirradiation groups, further supporting that deep space exposures can impair immune organ development\n(Figure 7A). Thus, two possible outcomes are postulated: (1) delayed lymphocyte proliferation or (2)\nelevated apoptosis of both dividing and non-dividing cells. In addition, B cell differentiation and humoral\nimmunity were also affected in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures\n3B and 3C) that may be partially dependent on cytokine signals (Figure 6) and Th cell populations (Figures\n4B and 4D). Innate immune proﬁles were also differentially affected following distinct exposures, adding\nanother layer of complexity to this model. Nonetheless, these results collectively indicate unique immuno-\ngenic proﬁles following different ionizing irradiation exposures, in the presence or absence of simulated\nmicrogravity that may be useful for future space bioscience studies to expand upon.\nAlong with different HU cage conditions/designs, head-down tilt angles (degrees of cephalad ﬂuid shifting)\nused to simulate microgravity may cause distinct immune results. For instance, Wei et al. reported reduced\nthymic and spleen weights are due to lymphocyte apoptosis induced through elevated stress responses\nand corticosterone production on day 10 of HU exposure (25\u0003–30\u0003 head-tilt angle) (Wei et al., 2003). How-\never, Ferreira et al. showed no difference in body or adrenal weights following 14 or 28 days (15\u0003 head-tilt\nangle) of HU (Ferreira et al., 2011). Furthermore, work by Tahimic et al. revealed spleen weights were\nreduced at 30 days (30\u0003 head-tilt angle) of HU, which may have partially depended on the number of circu-\nlating Th cell populations (Tahimic et al., 2019). In our study, reduced thymus, but not spleen, weights were\nnoted in HU-Sham, compared with NL-Sham controls (30o head-tilt angle) (Figures 1C and 1D). Further-\nmore, there was no signiﬁcant difference between Tc or Th populations following 14 days of HU, compared\nwith NL-Sham controls (Figures 4B–4E), but there were signiﬁcant reductions in total leukocyte populations\n(Figures 1F and 1G) and B cells (Figure 3B). Therefore, reduced thymus weights in HU-Sham compared to\nNL-Sham controls may be due to overall reduced leukocyte populations. Inﬂammation following simulated\nmicrogravity has been recorded in multiple studies (Cavey et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2010,\n2014), with an associated mechanism of elevated neutrophil counts (Dumont et al., 2007, 2008; Frenette\net al., 2002; Tahimic et al., 2019) leading to uncontrolled musculoskeletal damage (Dumont et al., 2008;\nFrenette et al., 2002). In our study, there were elevated neutrophils (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E), and Il-6\n(Figure 6C) after 14 days of HU, suggesting neutrophil persistence, as IL-6 protects neutrophils from\napoptosis (Asensi et al., 2004). Certainly, inﬂammatory neutrophil persistence can be damaging if not\nadequately controlled (Mortaz et al., 2018). Therefore, these results indicate HU, dependent on cage con-\nditions/designs, may promote inﬂammation.\nInnate immune populations were also evaluated. For one, SPE irradiation alone resulted in signiﬁcant\nelevation of eosinophils (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell (Figure 3D) percentages, compared to NL-Sham con-\ntrols. Interestingly, ionizing irradiation can cause cardiovascular complications (Puukila et al., 2017), while\nelevated NK cells (Ong et al., 2017) and eosinophils (Se´ gue´ la et al., 2015) can contribute to these pathol-\nogies. Gamma irradiation alone resulted in a signiﬁcant elevation in monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils,\nand NK/NKT cell percentages, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 2B–2D and Figure 3D), suggest-\ning distinct immune proﬁles are generated between different ionizing irradiation types. Indeed, gamma\nirradiation had considerable effects on innate immune cell recruitment into blood circulation, compared\nwith GCR and SPE irradiation, indicating different mechanisms of immunogenicity following irradiation\ndamage, which may be a factor of the high dose of gamma irradiation. Indeed, overall cell numbers\nwere reduced within all radiation exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls, indicating the damaging ef-\nfects of ionizing irradiation on the immune system (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1). However, for the purpose of\nestablishing the RBE in this study, gamma was used at a higher dose to make comparisons between\ncharged particles (GCR, SPE) and photons (gamma). In addition, there are qualitative differences between\nthe biological effects of each, such that gamma irradiation serves as a useful high-ionization control. Inter-\nestingly, all four innate populations studied are inﬂammation-producing cells upon activation and were\nsuppressed when gamma irradiation was combined with HU, indicating the potential for inhibited\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\n12\niScience 23, 101747, December 18, 2020\niScience\nArticle\n\ninﬂammation. Similar impairment was observed in SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups in terms\nof reduced eosinophil (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell percentages (Figure 3D). As such, a reduced number of\nselect innate immune cells 24 h following distinct irradiation treatments in combination with simulated\nmicrogravity, may be a result of impaired innate immune cell recruitment. In addition, miRNA immune\nGO term analyses indicated a general reduction in myeloid cell differentiation and FcR-mediated signaling\nin all exposure groups, suggesting distinct biological pathways involved in phagocytosis (Koenderman,\n2019) are suppressed during simulated deep space exposures (Figure 7A). Collectively, impairment in\nboth leukocyte recruitment and phagocytic function can result in inefﬁcient innate responses against chal-\nlenges, i.e., microbial or viral. In line with this, astronauts on board the ISS experience immune dysregula-\ntion and heightened infections (Cervantes and Hong, 2016; Crucian et al., 2015; Mehta et al., 2017; Nash,\n2000), which may be a result of poor immunogenic innate immune responses and recruitment. However,\nfurther studies with these distinct deep space-relevant exposures, circulating miRNAs, and cell types are\nrequired.\nAside from elevated Ifn-g in GCR irradiation exposure groups, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figure 6D),\nGCR irradiation in combination with HU displayed reduced inﬂammation compared with GCR irradiation\nalone, as measured by the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, Il-1b and Il-6. These results suggest simulated\nmicrogravity suppressed inﬂammation in combination with GCR irradiation (Figures 6B and 6C). Indeed,\nthis may partially explain reduced B cell percentage in GCR irradiation with simulated microgravity (Fig-\nure 3B), as IL-6 is a plasma cell differentiator that enhances humoral immunity (Dienz et al., 2009). Further-\nmore, IL-6 differentiates naive T cells into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which drives B cell maturation into\nplasma cells (Crotty, 2014). IL-1b has also recently been characterized to play an important role in Tfh\neffector cell development as well (Ritvo and Klatzmann, 2019). Therefore, reduced expression of both of\nthese cytokines in combined GCR irradiation with HU may be indirectly linked to reduced B cell differen-\ntiation. In line with this, both GCR irradiation groups displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in Th cells compared\nto NL-Sham controls (Figures 4B and 4D). Although distinct effector T cell proﬁles, including Tfh, were not\nthoroughly characterized, Tfh effector cell lineage would have been included in these overall Th cell pop-\nulations. Additionally, CD20 surface molecule expression on B cells is reduced during B cell maturation into\nplasma cells (Robillard et al., 2014; Styles et al., 2017). However, we did not see any difference in cell surface\nexpression of CD20 MFI (Figure 3C), suggesting B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells\nmay be impaired in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared to NL-Sham controls. As B cell numbers are\nreduced (with no difference in CD20 surface expression) within GCR and SPE in combination with HU\ngroups, there is a lower pool of antibody-production vehicles essential for effective humoral immunity.\nmiRNA GO immune terms displayed reduced B cell differentiation and homeostasis in SPE irradiation\nand gamma irradiation, compared with HU-Sham controls, but was no different with GCR irradiation\ngroups (Figure 7A), further suggesting distinct immune-related pathways are regulated following deep\nspace simulations. Of interest, robust gene expression of Il-4 (Figure 6E), which is produced by Th2 and\nTfh cells, directly promotes B cell maturation to plasma cells and ultimately the release of antibodies. There-\nfore, although initial B cell populations are reduced, functional output may be compensated for via robust\nexpression of Il-4. LEO spaceﬂight missions have described minimal differences in B cell numbers and anti-\nbody production of IgG or IgM; however, IgA levels in ﬂight were signiﬁcantly upregulated compared with\nground controls (Spielmann et al., 2019). This effect may be explained by the general effects of circulating\nmiRNAs, as humoral immunity is predicted to be elevated by miRNAs (Danger et al., 2014; O’Connell et al.,\n2010). In our study, general upregulation of humoral responses are shown, yet multiple miRNA GO terms\nrevealed that the humoral immune responses mediated by circulating Igs and B cells were suppressed with\nGCR combined with HU, compared to HU-Sham controls, further supporting humoral immunity may be\ndysregulated following deep space simulations (Figure 7A). Future studies addressing the level of Ig anti-\nbodies, B cell/plasma cell distribution, and circulating miRNAs involved during deep space missions would\nprovide further insight into mechanisms involved in humoral immunity.\nA principal ﬁnding in our study was reduced expression of Th and Tc cells, compared to NL-Sham controls.\nAs main components of the adaptive immune system, both Th and Tc cells provide the advantage of immu-\nnological memory and assist with humoral immunity, which are important to prevent recurrent infections\nand tumor development. This becomes particularly important during long-duration missions, where\nmedial intervention is limited. Indeed, infectious agents such as herpes simplex virus reactivate during\nLEO spaceﬂight and are dependent on impaired cytotoxic T cells (Mehta et al., 2017; Nash, 2000). Further-\nmore, previous reports have indicated ionizing irradiation activates T cells (Schaue and McBride, 2012).\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\niScience 23, 101747, December 18, 2020\n13\niScience\nArticle\n\nHowever, the overall effect of ionizing irradiation on lymphocyte outcomes (i.e., activation or apoptosis)\ndepends on multiple factors, most notably the dose and dose schedule (MacLennan and Kay, 1978; Schaue\nand McBride, 2012). For instance, preconditioning mice, i.e., irradiation for graft transplantation, relies on\nlethal bone marrow irradiation doses and fractionations to reduce lymphocyte counts (Bagley et al., 2002).\nIn our study, GCR irradiation caused extensive reduction in both Th and Tc cells, compared with SPE or\ngamma irradiation (Figures 4B–4E), indicating GCR irradiation produced more damaging effects on these\ncell types. Inhomogeneous dose depth between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photon (gamma) tracks\nmay be involved in this effect, as gamma irradiation exposure groups did not signiﬁcantly affect Th or Tc\nnumbers, compared with SPE and GCR irradiation groups. Thus, GCR and SPE irradiation may target\ndeeper immune tissues, such as lymph nodes, where the majority of T naive and circulating T effector cells\nreside when not trafﬁcking in the bloodstream (Hunter et al., 2016). The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes is\ndependent on the speed of DNA repair mechanisms relative to division, as non-proliferating cells are more\nradioresistant (Schaue and McBride, 2012). Radioresistance is observed in non-dividing cells as these cells\nare in G0 stage, during which DNA is compact and stable, protein-protected heterochromatin (Falk et al.,\n2008; Karagiannis et al., 2007). Proliferating lymphocytes, on the other hand, have exited the G0 stage and\nare in the DNA synthesis phase, which makes them more vulnerable to irradiation damage (Falk et al., 2008;\nKaragiannis et al., 2007). Cellular division requires correct, undamaged DNA to be copied to their progeny,\nand if repair mechanisms are not fast enough, elevated apoptosis results (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012).\nIndeed, miRNA Hallmark terms for DNA repair are upregulated, indicating after exposure to deep space\nsimulations, circulating miRNAs are involved in DNA repair machinery, whereby DNA damage has occurred\n(Figure 7B). Although we did not measure apoptosis directly, miRNA Hallmark terms also identiﬁed select\napoptosis pathways were engaged during GCR irradiation exposures, compared to HU-Sham controls\n(Figure 7B), suggesting elevated DNA damage may be beyond repair, leading to apoptosis, following\nGCR irradiation conditions.\nWe further assessed lymphocyte surface receptor expression of IL-7R. As described above, IL-7R is ex-\npressed on naive T cells, but not activated T cells, and then is re-expressed on memory T cells (Mazzucchelli\nand Durum, 2007). Indeed, IL-7R MFI was reduced in GCR irradiation combined with HU, compared to NL-\nSham controls, suggesting T cell activation (Figure 5C). In line with this, Il7R knockout mice have signiﬁcantly\nreduced developmental T and B cells, and are similar phenotypically as SCID mice, which are immunocom-\npromised (Peschon et al., 1994). This may somewhat explain overall reduced lymphocyte populations\nfollowing simulated spaceﬂight exposures, along with reduced thymic and splenic weights, as well. Interest-\ningly, miR-199a and miR-142–3p target Il7R (Luo and Fu, 2018), reducing its expression levels; however, in\nour report, mechanisms of this requires further investigation. Conversely, elevated IL-7R has been linked to\nmultiple inﬂammatory diseases (Anderson et al., 2011; Belarif et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2012). For example,\nblocking IL-7R inhibited JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K signaling of IFN-g from memory cytotoxic T cells, limiting\nchronic inﬂammation (Belarif et al., 2018). In line with this, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed general reduc-\ntion of PI3K/AKT signaling and inﬂammatory response pathways across all simulated deep space expo-\nsures, indicating miRNA involvement in suppression of these pathways (Figure 7B). Alternatively, HU-\nSham groups had elevated IL-7R MFI, which suggests elevated inﬂammation. Indeed, miRNA Hallmark\nterms displayed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) across all exposure groups, and HU-Sham controls\ndisplayed heightened ROS expression levels (Figure 7B). Heightened ROS can cause inﬂammation both in\nspaceﬂight and on Earth (Crucian et al., 2018; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2017), which may\nbe an associated mechanism involved during heightened inﬂammation in the HU-Sham groups. Therefore,\nIL-7R, along with neutrophil counts (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E), Il-6 expression (Figure 6C), and ROS Hall-\nmark terms regulated by miRNAs (Figure 7B) are all elevated in HU-Sham mice, further supporting inﬂam-\nmatory outcomes following prolonged microgravity. In line with this, ISS LEO crew member data displayed\ninﬂammation via elevated IL-1b and IL-1a compared with pre-ﬂight controls (Figure 8, Table S1). Impor-\ntantly, these molecules were induced early (day 15) during spaceﬂight, whereby the effects of ionizing irra-\ndiation exposures would have been minimal (Figure 8, Table S1), conﬁrming inﬂammation is induced in LEO\nastronauts, similar to our ground HU model.\nLymphopenia, or reduced T and B cell counts, poses a problem for adequate immunological protection\nagainst challenges (Schaue and McBride, 2012). Furthermore, lymphopenia recovery results in immune\nproﬁling changes that may be either detrimental or helpful to the host. In this report, compared to NL-\nSham controls, robust induction of Il-4 following all ionizing irradiation groups combined with HU was\nnoted. IL-4 is typically associated with Th2 effector cells, which are chieﬂy involved in allergic inﬂammation,\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\n14\niScience 23, 101747, December 18, 2020\niScience\nArticle\n\nincluding asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilic gastrointestinal inﬂammatory\ndisease (Nakayama et al., 2017). Interestingly, during spaceﬂight astronauts experience elevated allergic-\nlike symptoms including rashes (Dunn et al., 2018) and hypersensitivity episodes (Voorhies et al., 2019).\nTherefore, Th2 immunity may be the principal immune response generated during deep space exposures;\nhowever, further evaluation of the type of Th cell subtypes produced in response to simulated deep space\nexposures are necessary.\nDeep spaceﬂight exposures present immunologically complicated outcomes. Synergistic inﬂammatory or\nimmunogenic responses were variable in some, but not all, measurements, and in some cases were non-\nproductive. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs (cell-to-cell transfer via exosomes) (Montagner et al., 2013;\nSchwarzenbach and Gahan, 2019) contribute to unique immune proﬁles, therefore miRNAs may be impor-\ntant for immune-targeted therapies. Although not studied in this report, added complexities involving\ncombined types of ionizing irradiation, as well as protracted versus acute irradiation exposures that would\nalso be experienced during deep spaceﬂight, are necessary to consider in future studies. Furthermore,\nonly a small snippet into the immune response was assessed in this study; therefore, longitudinal re-\nsponses and functional consequences are also required in future studies. Nonetheless, we found distinct\nimmune proﬁles and miRNA signatures are produced by each irradiation exposure group, singly or in\ncombination with HU in mice. Therefore, selective countermeasures targeting distinct immune responses\nin crew members may be required during long-duration exploratory missions to the lunar surface and\nMars.\nLimitations of the Study\nIn this study, we report the immune and miRNA differentials of mice following ground-based simulations\nof deep spaceﬂight, along with analyses of crew member inﬂammation in LEO. As this study utilized\nground-based simulations in mice, deep spaceﬂight comparisons would be required to conﬁrm similar\nproﬁles. Additionally, interpretation of whole-blood transcriptomics to speciﬁc cell types is limited in\nthis study; however, these data provide insight into the overall cytokine proﬁle induced by each condi-\ntion that is independent of cell frequency. Furthermore, the contribution of miRNAs to the generated\nimmune populations is described; however, an understanding into mechanism and/or functional out-\ncomes would fully elucidate their role to overall immunity. In addition, the time point of collections\nwas at an immediate response, yet the long-term response would also be of beneﬁt, in particular, for\nlong-duration missions. Finally, the comparisons between the immune differentials in mice and humans\nis a limitation; however, this study can give some insight into the signiﬁcant immune population changes\n(i.e., T cytotoxic lymphocytes) that can be studied in humans during deep spaceﬂight mission in the near\nfuture.\nResource Availability\nLead Contact\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to the Lead Contact, Af-\nshin Beheshti, PhD (afshin.beheshti@nasa.gov).\nMaterials Availability\nThis study did not generate any unique reagents.\nData and Code Availability\nThe plasma miRNA-seq raw fastq ﬁles can be found on Database: NASA’s GeneLab data repository/plat-\nform (https://genelab.nasa.gov/).

All human astronaut data were reviewed and approved \nby the NASA Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. \n \nExperimental design  \n15-week +/- 3-day old, C57BL/6J wildtype (Wt) female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories \nand housed at BNL. Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a standard 12:12h \nlight:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for 1-week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water \nwere given ad libitum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. Mice were cage acclimated \n(n=10 mice per group; 2 mice per cage to maintain social interaction) 3-days prior to HU, followed by 14-\ndays either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, see details below). Irradiation was administered \non day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-hours post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 \noverdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated \ntubes (0.5 M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2,000xg for 15 minutes. Plasma was collected \nand flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for -80°C storage. A 100 μl aliquot of cellular fraction was flash frozen \nand stored at -80°C for RNA analyses, while the remaining cellular fraction was lysed with 1x RBC lysis \nbuffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by flow cytometric preparation and analyses, as describe below. \nBody weight tracking was performed on days -3, 0, 7 and 14. The experimental timeline is described in \nFigure 1A. \n \nHindlimb Unloading \nHindlimb unloading was performed using the adjusted Morey-Holton method for social housing (n=2 per \ncage) (Tahimic et al., 2019). Briefly, mice were suspended from the tail using non-invasive traction tape \nattached to an adjustable pulley mounted on the top of a standard rodent cage. The adjustable nature of \nthe device allows the user to position the animal in a head-down position (approximately 30° to the horizon) \nonce attached. The crossbar height, lateral crossbar position, and chain length are adjustable. The pulley \nis free to move along the crossbar that spans the length of the top of the cage enabling the mouse to \nnavigate freely on one half of the cage using its forepaws and to interact with the second mouse in the \ncage, without enabling ambulation of the limbs. Individual food and water sources are provided to each \nmouse and replaced daily. Control mice were housed in identical cages with normal ambulation.  \n \n\n \nSimulated GCR, SPE and gamma irradiation \nOn day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility \nby animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while \nmaintaining hindlimb suspension. The following doses of irradiation were administered; simplified GCR sim \n(0.5 Gy), SPE (1 Gy), Gamma (5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). To simulate GCR, we used the simplified \nGCR simulation of ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula  that consists of 5 \nions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, \nand protons at 250 MeV. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in \ndeep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 minutes instead of \nthe actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. Further, GCR sim is a mixture of high and low LET ions in a \nratio of 15% to 85%, respectfully. To simulate SPE, we used a total dose of 1Gy protons with energy ranges \nfrom 50MeV to 150MeV. For all irradiations a 60x60 beam was utilized at NSRL. For radiation dose \nequivalence and biological reference, we used 5 Gy gamma irradiation with the cesium resource available \nat BNL, in the absence of HU due to resource limitations. Sham controls were treated similar to GCR/SPE \nirradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR \nsimualtion, i.e. 25 minutes.  \n \nMETHODS DETAILS \n \nFlow cytometry \nCollected blood samples were lysed with 1x RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fixed in 4% \nparaformaldehyde for 15 minutes on ice, washed twice with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Thermo \nFisher Scientific), and stored at 4ºC until staining. Single-cell suspensions were generated for flow \ncytometry acquisition. Debris was gated off and doublet discrimination was performed. Cells were Fc \nblocked for 20 minutes and probed with mouse reactive antibodies targeting anti-CD45, anti-CD11b, anti-\nLy6G, anti-NK1.1, anti-CD20, anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, and anti-IL-7R. All antibodies and Fc block \nwere purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Unstained and single-color compensation controls were \nused. Cells were acquired using a BD FACSMelodyTM and analyzed using FlowJoTM Software (v10.5.3). \n \nQuantitative (q)PCR  \nCollected blood samples were flash frozen and total RNA isolation using miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAgen) \nfollowing manufactures’ recommendations. Concentration and purity were determined using a Bioanalyzer \n2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number > 8. 1 μg of total RNA was prepared for cDNA synthesis using \niSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kits (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR was performed using iQTM SYBR® Green \nSupermix (Bio-Rad) and primers (IDT) were designed using NCBI design tool. An ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR \n(Applied Biosystems) was used and threshold cycle values that were ≥ 35 cycles were excluded from the \nresults. Primer sequence for the following genes are listed in the key resource table. Data was analyzed \nusing the ΔΔcT method with Gapdh as the normalizer gene, and relative fold change (RFC) is displayed. \n \nmiRNA isolation, sequencing, and data analyses   \nLibrary construction and sequencing was performed from miRNAs isolated from plasma from the mouse \nexperiments described above. The miRNA extraction was carried out using the QIAgen miRNeasy \nserum/plasma kit (#217184). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 \n(Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number > 7. Approximately 1 μg of total RNA was used to prepare small RNA \nlibrary according to protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Single-\nend sequencing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LC Sciences (Hangzhou, \nChina) following the vendor's recommended protocol. \n \nRaw reads were subjected to an in-house software program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, \nHouston, Texas, USA) to remove adapter dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, \ntRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequences with length in 18~26 nucleotide \nwere mapped to specific species precursors in miRBase 22.0 by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs \nand novel 3p- and 5p- derived miRNAs. Length variation at both 3’ and 5’ ends and one mismatch inside \nof the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to specific species mature \nmiRNAs in hairpin arms were identified as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other \narm of known specific species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm \nwere considered to be novel 5p- or 3p- derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mapped \n\n \nto other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of specific species) in miRBase 22.0 by BLAST \nsearch, and the mapped pre-miRNAs were further BLASTed against the specific species genomes to \ndetermine their genomic locations. The above two we defined as known miRNAs. The unmapped \nsequences were BLASTed against the specific genomes, and the hairpin RNA structures containing \nsequences \nwere \npredicated \nfrom \nthe \nflank \n80 \nnt \nsequences \nusing \nRNAfold \nsoftware \n(http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi). The criteria for secondary structure \nprediction were: (1) number of nucleotides in one bulge in stem (≤12); (2) number of base pairs in the stem \nregion of the predicted hairpin (≥16); (3) cutoff of free energy (kCal/mol ≤-15); (4) length of hairpin (up and \ndown stems + terminal loop ≥50); (5) length of hairpin loop (≤20); (6) number of nucleotides in one bulge in \nmature region (≤8); (7) number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region (≤4); (8) number of biased \nbulges in mature region (≤2); (9) number of errors in mature region (≤7); (10) number of base pairs in the \nmature region of the predicted hairpin (≥12); and (11) percent of mature in stem (≥80). Differential \nexpression of miRNAs based on normalized deep-sequencing counts was analyzed by selectively using \nFisher exact test, Chi-squared 2X2 test, Chi-squared nXn test, Student t test, or ANOVA based on the \nexperimental design. The significance threshold was set to be 0.01 and 0.05 in each test. The plasma \nmiRNA-seq \nraw \nfastq \nfiles \ncan \nbe \nfound \non \nNASA’s \nGeneLab \ndata \nrepository/platform \n(https://genelab.nasa.gov/) with the following identifiers: GLDS-336, DOI: 10.26030/qasa-rr29. \n \nTo determine gene ontology (GO) and Hallmark pathways being regulated by the miRNAs we \nperformed miRNA gene set analysis utilizing the RBiomirGS v0.2.12 R package (Zhang and Storey, 2018) \nfrom the processed miRNA analysis for all conditions in the plasma. From the GO terms we chose an FDR \n< 0.05 cutoff for significantly regulated GO Terms. We then determined the specific immune related GO \nterms by mapping to the GO Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) information for specific GO immune terms \n(Smith and Eppig, 2009). We plotted the specific GO terms with R packages UpsetR v1.4.0 (Conway et al., \n2017) and pheatmap v1.0.12 (Kolde R. pheatmap: Pretty heatmaps).  \n \nHuman physiological inflammation data \nData are reported from three human subject experiments conducted on the International Space Station: \nNutritional Status Assessment (2006-2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in \nBone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010-2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013-\n2018). All protocols were reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Review Board and all subjects \nprovided written informed consent. While subsets of some of these data have been published in other \npapers (Crucian et al., 2018), as a whole, the data provided here have not been previously published. In \naddition, the inflammation data provided have been reanalyzed from data that were submitted with another \npaper included in this special NASA Cell issue (Malkani et al., 2020).  \n \nCrews from these experiments completed missions of 4-6 months in duration, and these studies \nincluded blood collections before, during, and after flight, with analysis of an array of inflammation \nbiochemical markers. Blood samples were collected 2 or 3 times before flight: approximately Launch minus \n(L-) 45 days. In some cases, a third blood sample was collected (typically along with the L-45 collection), \nand these tubes were centrifuged and frozen for aliquoting after flight batched with the samples collected \ninflight. Blood samples were collected inflight, at approximately Flight Day (FD) 15, FD30, FD60, FD120, \nand FD180. Postflight samples were collected in the first 24-h after landing (designated return+0, R+0) and \nagain 30-d later (R+30). The R+0 samples were not necessarily fasting, given the time of day and nature \nof return from flight. Of the 59 crewmembers reported: 8 returned on the Space Shuttle, with blood collection \n2-4 hours after landing; 51 landed in Kazakhstan, with 7 of them returning to Star City, Russia, with blood \ncollection 8-10 hours after landing; 44 were transported directly back to the Johnson Space Center in \nHouston, with blood collection approximately 24-h after landing. Pre and postflight collections included two \n24-h urine collections, and inflight collections included one 24-h urine collection. These collection \ntechniques have been previously described (Smith et al., 2012; Zwart et al., 2011). \n \nWe report here inflammatory markers were analyzed using standard techniques as reported \npreviously (Crucian et al., 2018; Zwart et al., 2016; Zwart et al., 2013; Zwart et al., 2009). As of this writing, \ndata were available for 59 crewmembers (47 males and 12 females). Age at launch was 47.0 ± 5.6 y, body \nmass at launch was 79.2 ± 11.8 kg (M: 83.3 ± 9.3; F: 63.0 ± 4.5). Body mass index was 25.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 \n(M: 26.4 ± 2.6; F: 22.3 ± 1.5). All available data are reported here, although the reported n for any given \ntest or session varies for a number of reasons, including, not all experiments had all analytes included, \nmission length differences for some crewmembers, schedule or other issues occasionally precluded sample \ncollection, and methods changes over time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to \n\n \ntest for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were \nmade using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p*** < \n0.001 are reported. \n \nQuantification and Statistical Analysis  \nFor Figures 1-5, a Grubbs test was performed on all datasets followed by testing for normal distribution via \na Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If data were normally distributed, a one-way ANOVA Dunnett test was \nperformed to compared NL and HU controls to all groups and a parametric unpaired t-test with Welsh’s \ncorrection was performed to compared between similar irradiation groups. If normality was not passed, both \na non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn’s posthoc analyses was performed to compare NL and \nHU controls to all groups and a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test compared between similar irradiation \ngroups were performed. All data are means ±SEM (p < 0.05, n = 5-10 per group depending on associated \nfigure). “*” denotes significant difference between NL-Sham and associated group, “#” denotes significant \ndifference between HU-Sham associated group, and intergroup “brackets with a &” denotes significant \ndifference between each group. Filled circles, boxes, and bars denotes normal loaded (NL) and non-filled \ncircles, boxes, and bars denotes hindlimb unloaded (HU). \nFor Figure 7, a repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during \nand after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni \nt-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for and data are means ±SEM (p*** < 0.001, n = 59 \ncrewmembers; 47 males, 12 females). GraphPad Prism software was used to analyze all associated figures \n(v. 8.4.2). \n \n\n \nSupplemental References \nConway, J.R., Lex, A., and Gehlenborg, N. (2017).
