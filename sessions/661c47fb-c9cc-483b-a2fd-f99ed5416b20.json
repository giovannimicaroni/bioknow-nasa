Yet current frameworks \nfor aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision \nmedicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine \ndatabases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas \n(SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic \nresearch profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, \nJAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA \nresource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space \nomics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine \nBiobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles \nencompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics \nand microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, \nincluding cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well \nas mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific \nmouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to \naccelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk \nmitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration- \nclass missions.\nWith an exponential increase in launches since 2019, space is rapidly \nbecoming more accessible1. Multiple commercial and state-sponsored \ngroups are developing roadmaps to construct space stations, moon \nbases, Mars colonies and other permanent establishments beyond \nEarth1. Although innovation across the aerospace sector makes these \nambitions technologically achievable, the biomedical challenges for \ncrews in these extraplanetary habitats still need to be addressed, as \nhumans did not evolve to survive in such extreme environments. The \nclinical consequences of this evolutionary mismatch of spaceflight \nexposure and adaptation have revealed a plethora of challenges to \nlong-term space habitation, including a loss in bone density and mus-\ncle mass2, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome3, perturbed \nimmune function4 and spaceflight anaemia5. These physiological \nchanges during spaceflight appear to imprint on the health status in \nhumans; a chief example of this long-term effect is the increased risk \nof cardiovascular pathology observed in astronauts compared with \nage-matched controls6.\nBefore long-term space habitation is feasible, these biomedical chal-\nlenges must be understood and mitigated. However, the aetiologies \ndriving them are not understood, with the low number of astronauts \nyielding limited opportunities for in-depth biomolecular characteriza-\ntion. For example, two of the largest multi-omic studies to date have \nbeen the NASA Twins Study, which has published an in-depth molecular \nand cognitive profile of a single astronaut7, and the Japanese Aero-\nspace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) project, \nwhich has profiled cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cfRNA in six astronauts8,9. \nThus, achieving statistical power requires integrating data from other \ncohorts, such as the MARROW study, and other missions5,10. Further-\nmore, these analyses are complicated by the substantial variation in \nphysiological responses to spaceflight among astronauts. Therefore, \nthere is a need for increasingly large, detailed multi-omic profiles of \nastronauts to characterize the diversity of physiological shifts as a \nfunction of spaceflight11.\nTo achieve this end, we have leveraged the burgeoning commercial \nspaceflight industry. With the launch of SpaceX’s 2021 Inspiration4 (I4) \nmission, a cohort of all-civilian astronauts successfully completed a \nhigh elevation (585 km), 3-day orbital mission within a SpaceX Dragon \ncapsule. Using recently developed protocols, the crew participated in \na range of biospecimen collections before, during and after their mis-\nsion12. We used the I4 biospecimens to deeply profile the effect of the \nstressors of spaceflight (for example, microgravity and space radiation) \non crew physiology and health. We also compared these results with \nprevious missions and control datasets, creating the largest-to-date \nmolecular atlas of the effect of spaceflight on the human body, encom-\npassing almost 3,000 samples and over 75 billion sequenced nucleic \nacids. Collectively, these resources are referred to as SOMA, and the \nsamples are linked to a Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank (CAMbank) \nthat stores viably frozen specimens for future, additional analyses.\nAs with Earth-based cohorts13, these accessible data — when pro-\nfiled and aggregated at scale — will enable the development of both \npersonalized and general medical guidance for astronauts14. A large \ngroup of subject matter experts in artificial intelligence has recently \nreleased recommendations focused on the importance of generating \nand archiving space data into the NASA Open Science Data Repository \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07639-y\nReceived: 30 December 2022\nAccepted: 31 May 2024\nPublished online: 11 June 2024\nOpen access\n Check for updates\nA list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper.\n\n1146  |  Nature  |  Vol 632  |  29 August 2024\nArticle\n(OSDR)15,16 to enable autonomous and intelligent precision space health \nsystems, and to monitor, aggregate and assess biomedical statuses \nfor future deep space missions17. In addition, the study of the parallels \nbetween the physiological effects of spaceflight and ageing, chronic \ndisease and immune system disorders using omics data can pave the \nway for therapeutics applicable to conditions on Earth.\nHere we present a detailed guide to the SOMA resource, which \nincludes the 2,911 samples collected during the I4 mission11,12, as well \nas spatial transcriptomics data, long-read profiles of astronaut RNA, \nmicrobiome data, exosome profiles and in-depth immune diversity \nmaps. Additional spaceflight data were annotated and compiled into \nthe SOMA portal to help contextualize gene, protein or metabolite \ndynamics, including data from the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA’s CFE \nmission8,9, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data after simu-\nlated microgravity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)18, \nand rat or mouse spaceflight data matched to human orthologues. In \naddition to rigorous dataset annotations, we detail (1) a comparison \nof conclusions on NASA Twins Study and flight dynamics comparing \nshort-duration and long-duration missions, (2) cell-type-specific \nresponses to spaceflight previously undocumented in astronauts, \n(3) cfRNA expression profiles showing haematological responses \nduring recovery from spaceflight, and (4) additional analyses on \nindividual responses to spaceflight from proteomic, transcriptomic \nand microbiome data. Data and samples generated in this study are \navailable through SOMA (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu), NASA OSDR \n(https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) and CAMbank (https://cambank.weill.\ncornell.edu/), which offer an unprecedented view of the multi-system \nomics changes before, during and after spaceflight.\nComprehensive astronaut data resource\nTo generate a comprehensive profile of the physiological changes of \nthe I4 crew (29, 38, 42 and 51 years of age), 13 biospecimen sample types \nwere collected and processed, including whole blood, serum, PBMCs, \nplasma, extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) derived from plasma, \ndried blood spots, oral swabs, nasal swabs, skin biopsies, skin swabs, \ncapsule (SpaceX Dragon) swabs, urine and stool specimens12. After \ncollection, samples were subject to a battery of multi-omic assays, \nincluding clinical (CLIA) whole-genome sequencing, a clonal haema-\ntopoiesis panel, direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq), single-nucleus RNA-seq \n(snRNA-seq), single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chroma-\ntin with sequencing (snATAC-seq), single-cell B cell repertoire (BCR) and \nT cell repertoire (TCR) V(D)J sequencing, untargeted plasma proteom-\nics (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry), untargeted \nplasma metabolomics, cfDNA sequencing, cfRNA, metagenomics, \nmetatranscriptomics and spatially resolved transcriptomics. In addi-\ntion, chemokine, cytokine and cardiovascular biomarkers were quanti-\nfied, and a CLIA lab (Quest Diagnostics) was used to perform a complete \nblood count and comprehensive metabolic panel (Fig. 1a). Datasets \nwere generated across ten timepoints: three pre-flight (L−92, L−44 \nand L−3), three in-flight (flight day 1 (FD1), FD2 and FD3), one immedi-\nately post-flight (R+1) and three recovery (R+45, R+82 and R+194) span-\nning 289 days (Fig. 1b). Assays were performed on all crew members \nunless otherwise noted (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).\nA total of 2,911 samples were banked, with 1,194 samples processed \nfor sequencing, imaging and biochemical analysis (Supplementary \nTable 1). These results and assays subsume and expand on work and \nprotocols from previous missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the \nNASA Twins Study and some NASA astronauts (Fig. 1c). This latter cat-\negory spans studies primarily from the International Space Station \n(ISS) that lack certain metadata, primarily duration spent in space \nand launch dates, to maintain astronaut anonymity. These studies \ninclude chemokine/cytokine biomarker panels (n = 46 astronauts), \ncomprehensive metabolic panels, telomere length quantitative PCR \n(qPCR) and ISS-surface metagenomic profiling (Fig. 1c).\nThe SOMA resources were first compared with the NASA OSDR \ndatabase, which contains all publicly accessible human omics data \nfrom spaceflight and ground analogue studies. OSDR hosts 76 human \nomics studies, of which 11 are from human primary cells exposed to \nspaceflight. The other studies encompassed cell line and ground \nstudies, including high-altitude studies (Extended Data Fig. 1a and \nSupplementary Table 2), which were all merged with the SOMA data-\nset. Once merged, the total number of sequenced nucleic acid mol-\necules from this study represents a more than tenfold increase in \nthe total amount of human omics data in the OSDR (Extended Data \nFig. 1b), across all spaceflight studies, ground studies, cell line and \nprimary cell experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary \nTables 2 and 3).\nThe data from the missions were then divided into three analysis \ntimeframes: (1) flight profiles, (2) recovery profiles and (3) longitu-\ndinal profiles (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Flight profiles reveal the most \nimmediate effect of spaceflight, recovery profiles catalogue changes \nthat occur after return to Earth, and the longitudinal profiles identify \nchanges that have not returned to baseline after returning to Earth. \nWe focused on several outputs for the resource, including first calcu-\nlating differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for (1) PBMC snRNA-seq, \n(2) whole-blood dRNA-seq, (3) skin spatially resolved transcriptom-\nics, and (4) cfRNA. We also mapped differentially methylated genes \nfrom whole-blood dRNA-seq, differentially accessible regions from \nPBMC snATAC-seq, isotype identification from TCR and BCR V(D)J \nsequencing, differentially abundant proteins from plasma and EVP \nproteomics, differential metabolites from liquid chromatography–\nmass spectrometry metabolomics, and microbial differentials from \nmetagenomic and metatranscriptomic assays (Extended Data Fig. 2), \nwith all raw and processed data annotated in the OSDR (Supplementary \nTable 4).\nI4 reproduces NASA Twins Study\nTelomere elongation has been previously described in three astronauts \nwho stayed for 6 months to 1 year aboard the ISS7,19,20, but it was unclear \nhow quickly such a phenotype appeared in astronauts. The average \ntelomere length in all I4 crew members increased during spaceflight \n(17–22% longer), and this trend was statistically significant \n(mixed-effects linear model P = 0.0048; Fig. 2a). This finding is par-\nticularly notable, given the shorter mission duration (3 days total) and \nhigher elevation of the I4 mission than the ISS studies, indicating that \ntelomere length dynamics respond much more rapidly to spaceflight \nthan previously observed.\nWe then compared the DEGs and cytokine changes from the Twins \nStudy with those observed in the snRNA-seq data from the I4 mission, \nas well as compared with the expected DEGs of the assay from repli-\ncate negative control donor PBMCs (see Methods). The cross-mission \nDEG comparison highlighted a consistent response between both \ntypes of T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ markers (552 and 608 DEGs, \nrespectively, both <2.2 × 10−16), across both sorted T cells or single-cell \nannotated cells (Fig. 2b). Conversely, B cells were less responsive to \nspaceflight, as expected from previous work in the Twins Study7, which \nshowed B cells as either not significant or less responsive to spaceflight. \nFor the four overlapping cytokines measured in the Twins Study with \nour panel, we found significant increases in three: IL-6 (P = 0.014), IL-10 \n(P = 0.021) and CCL2 (P = 0.040) (Fig. 2c); these cytokines also showed \nchanges and similar increases in other long-duration (more than \n6 months) crews (Fig. 2c). However, we also ran a differential analysis \nof all cytokines detected on the I4 mission, to detect any differences \nfrom the Twins Study. Indeed, the levels of BDNF showed a statistically \nsignificant decrease (P = 0.00011, q = 0.0153), and IL-19 levels showed \na statistically significant increase (P = 0.00015, q = 0.0153) during the \npost-flight (R+1) timepoint that returned to baseline during recovery \n(R+45 and R+82; Fig. 2d).\n\nNature  |  Vol 632  |  29 August 2024  |  1147\nDistinct RNA fingerprints of spaceflight\nBeyond recapitulating known biomarkers of spaceflight, the atlas inte-\ngrated newer assays that were not available in previous missions, with a \nparticular emphasis on RNA profiling. The first novel assay was spatially \nresolved transcriptomics on skin biopsies, which were obtained from \nall crew members during one pre-flight timepoint (L−44) and the day \nafter landing back on Earth (R+1). The 4-mm biopsies were stained \nwith markers for DNA, PanCK, FAP and α-SMA and then processed with \nthe NanoString/Bruker GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, where regions \nof interest were selected based on the tissue structures identified by \nthe fluorescence staining (Extended Data Fig. 3a). After filtering out \noutliers, the RNA counts were used for downstream data analysis, gen-\nerating 95 regions of interest across four skin compartments: outer \nepidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis and vasculature (Extended \nData Fig. 3b,c). This analysis revealed a distinct set of DEGs, including \nJAK–STAT signalling, and melanocyte signatures (Fig. 3).\nA second RNA assay for spaceflight integrated into SOMA was cfRNA \nprofiling, which has recently been established as a dynamic tool for \nmapping temporal alterations in cfRNA composition and cell lysis21. \nHowever, bulk cfRNA had not been utilized to measure the response \nof spaceflight until the JAXA CFE study8,9 and the I4 mission12. Using \nprincipal component analysis, we identified a distinct separation in \ncfRNA profiles pre-flight versus post-flight and recovery for I4, sug-\ngesting a systemic physiological shift probably induced by space travel \n(Extended Data Fig. 3d). This was further reflected in the differential \nabundance of cfRNA genes across various timepoints, revealing spe-\ncific patterns of noncoding expression (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and \nRNA types (Extended Data Fig. 3f) that correspond with the space-\nflight timeline. The cell-type proportions inferred from the cfRNA \nprofiles also exhibited spaceflight-associated variation over time and \nshowed variation distinct from a set of healthy blood donor controls \n(n = 35; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5).

Of note, the melanocyte cell pro-\nportions that demonstrated significant changes post-flight (Fig. 3c) \nwere also found in the spatial skin transcriptomics data, providing addi-\ntional evidence of adaptive skin responses to the space environment.\nA third novel RNA method applied to these spaceflight samples \nfocused on RNA isoforms and RNA modifications (epitranscriptome), \nthrough dRNA-seq on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION \nand deep RNA-seq (more than 400 million reads per sample) on the \nUltima Genomics UG100. These data quantified genes that were dif-\nferentially expressed and displayed differential N6-methyladenosine \nmethylation (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), or both, and were analysed \nfor enriched Gene Ontology pathways. We identified a set of sites (set \nM-I; Extended Data Fig. 4b) that undergoes hypomethylation during \nrecovery, another set (set M-II) that is detectably hypermethylated from \nspaceflight, and a set (set M-III) that exhibits novel hypermethylation \nduring recovery and longitudinally as well. The common pathways in \nall three sets (Extended Data Fig. 4b) showed evidence of radiation \nand telomere response, including ‘TSAI response to radiation therapy’ \nand ‘Wiemann telomere shortening’22. In addition, the set of down-\nregulated pathways after landing (recovery) was distinct, including \ngenes associated with breathing regulation (for example, CO2 and O2 \ntake-up and release by erythrocytes), which matches those pathways \nassociated with crew response ranges (below, Fig. 5). Although further \nstudies are needed to validate and delineate the potential mechanisms \nof these RNA dynamics (cfRNA, spatial and RNA modifications), these \npathways suggest a potential relationship between RNA expression \nand methylation in regulating haematological and dermatological \nfunctions upon return to Earth.\nGene regulatory changes during recovery\nLeveraging the time-series data, we next analysed PBMC gene expres-\nsion from snRNA-seq to discern whether unique DEGs are present \nat each timepoint. We examined DEGs from immediately post-flight \n(FP1) through the recovery profiles (RP1 and RP2) to observe how gene \nexpression profiles are re-established after spaceflight. The number of \nDEGs was used to quantify the severity and recovery of crew response, \nand we also compared identified DEGs from a negative control group, \nincluding two healthy donors and read-depth- and cell-count-matched \npermutation group (Extended Data Fig. 5), with an average of more \nthan 700 cells per crew member, per timepoint, per cell type.

However, the DEG count increased in B cells, CD4+ \nT cells, CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 4a); by RP2, all cell types \nhad lower DEG counts than at FP1 and began to approach the expected \nnoise range of single-cell DEGs (Fig. 4a).\nAs DEG counts were higher at RP1 than at FP1 for several cell types, \nwe hypothesized the introduction of distinct DEGs after landing back \non Earth. First, we calculated the percentage of DEGs unique to FP1 \nat both RP1 and RP2, focusing on cell-type-specific DEGs (Fig. 4b). By \nLP2 (L−92, L−44 and L−3 versus R+82), we observed that nearly all dif-\nferential gene expression was driven by the same set of genes that were \ndifferentially expressed at FP1, with the exception of CD14+ monocytes, \nwhich had a unique longitudinal profile not strongly connected with \nthe DEG responses in other cells. With the exception of CD14+ mono-\ncytes, the RP1 profile is distinct in the abundance of DEGs not present \nin FP1, but this perturbation almost entirely (more than 95% of genes) \ndisappeared after flight (RP2 and LP2). From the DEGs shared with FP1, \nwe observed that gene expression directionality reversed for nearly \nall DEGs between FP1 and each recovery profile (Fig. 4c), indicating a \nreturn to baseline for those DEGs. The exception to this were two genes \nfrom the CD14+ monocyte population — AHR (log2FC of 0.742 (FP1) and \nlog2FC of 0.808 (RP1)) and PELI1 (log2FC of 0.539 (FP1) and log2FC of \n0.560 (RP1); Fig. 4c) — in which there was a positive log2FC expression \nat both FP1 and RP1.\nFrom the DEGs that were unique to FP1, we next quantified the \nuniformity of the pathway enrichment between two PBMC lineages: \nT cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and monocytes (CD14+ and CD16+; Supple-\nmentary Table 6). Of note, 211 (70.8%) genes were unique to individual \ncell types and 87 (29.2%) were shared between two or more cell types \n(Extended Data Fig. 6a). To identify enriched pathways among the \ngene set for each cell type, overrepresentation analysis was performed \non Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways \n(Supplementary Table 6). Even though 70.8% of genes were unique \nto each cell type, their response was more convergent; unique path-\nways only ranged from 4.2% (CD4+ T cells) to 42.5% (CD14+ monocytes; \nExtended Data Fig. 6b). Yet some pathways were cell-type specific, \nsuch as the circadian entrainment pathway in CD14+ monocytes, \nwith genes GNG2, GNAS, PRKCB, CREB1 and CAMK2D driving the \noverrepresentation from the gene set for this pathway (Fig. 4d).

Other pathways, such as the IL-17 signalling pathway, con-\ntain mixtures of shared genes and unique genes and are significantly \noverrepresented across all cell types (Fig. 4d). This also indicates \nthat although cell types are distinct, they appear to have a set of core \npathways in response to spaceflight, with 30–60% of overrepresented \npathways shared both within and between lineages (Extended Data \nFig. 6b).\nTo examine the chromatin accessibility and regulatory landscape in \neach cell population, we then analysed the transcription factor-binding \nsite (TFBS) motif accessibility changes from snATAC-seq data to identify \nthe top motifs in flight and recovery profiles (Extended Data Fig. 7). We \nfirst observed that increased gene expression was correlated with more \naccessibility at the transcription start sites, and closed chromatin was \nassociated with downregulated genes (all P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum \ntest, for all cell types; Extended Data Fig. 7a). The motif accessibility \nchanges associated with recovery profiles recapitulated the trend in \ngene expression and chromatin accessibility data, which showed lower \naccessibility in regions of the genome with closed chromatin and higher \nexpression in regions of more accessibility (Extended Data Fig. 7b). In \naddition, we showed the top five upregulated and downregulated TFBS \nmotifs per cell type in FP1, RP1 and RP2, which revealed both common \nand distinct motifs and their accessibility across cell types (Extended \nData Fig. 7c–e). These data also provided further evidence of cell-type \nspecificity in the differences of chromatin and transcription factor \naccessibility dynamics.\nIntra-individual spaceflight responses\nTo understand individual variation during spaceflight, the coefficient \nof variation was measured across microbial, proteomic, cytokine and \ngene expression normalized count data, calculated by time interval \n(pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight and recovery). Normalized coefficient \nof variation scores (see Methods) were calculated for each body area \nfrom the microbial swabs from both metagenomic and metatranscrip-\ntomic data. The oral and forearm microbial variation (Extended Data \nFig. 8a,b) showed Rothia mucilaginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis \nas leading variable strains, but each body site has distinct higher coef-\nficient of variation species (other body sites are shown in Extended \nData Fig. 8c–j and Supplementary Table 7).

To characterize the participant-to-participant variation \nand null distributions, we also calculated the differentials for FP1 along \nwith label permutation testing on these calculations to confirm that \npost-flight coefficient of variation was not higher than other timepoints \n(see Methods; Supplementary Table 8).\nWe then utilized the data across missions (I4, Twins Study and JAXA), \nassays (scRNA-seq, cfRNA, bulk RNA-seq and proteomics) and cell \ntypes (CD4, CD8, CD14 and CD16) to find the most recurrent pathways \nassociated with spaceflight. The most enriched pathways were antigen \nbinding, haemoglobin, cytokine signalling and immune activation, \nwhich confirmed the DEG-related signatures and also validated the \nsignatures from our I4 mission (Fig. 5). Moreover, the NASA Twins Study \ndata and cfRNA profiles from the JAXA study confirmed many of the \ntop-ranked pathways, while also showing differences between bulk \nblood RNA and protein markers and purified cell populations. These \ndata indicate that leveraging both bulk and sorted cell populations \ncan help to clarify signals coming from crew blood dynamics related \nto spaceflight.\nAccess to datasets and crew samples\nThis study introduces full accessibility of astronaut data to the sci-\nentific community. Datasets are accessible through an online web \nportal and scientific data repositories, as well as controlled access \nto more sensitive data (for example, genetic sequence data) and \nphysical specimens. The online web portal splits the data into three \ndata browsers: the SOMA browser, the I4 single-cell browser and the \nmicrobiome browser (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). The SOMA browser \n(https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/SOMA_Browser/) enables visu-\nalization of gene expression (bulk RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, cfRNA-seq \nand spatially resolved transcriptomics), mass spectrometry (plasma \nproteomics, plasma metabolomics and plasma EVP proteomics) and \nmicrobial (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic) data. Gene expres-\nsion and protein abundance are visualized for each astronaut by time-\npoint, with fold-change values, statistical significance (q value) and \nsummary tables. Any selected gene is also then plotted across data \nfor other missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the NASA Twins \nStudy, mouse spaceflight datasets from NASA OSDR and Genelab, and \ncontrol cohorts. For additional granularity, the single-cell browser \n(https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Multiome/) provides \nvisualizations specific to single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) \nand chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data, and includes qual-\nity metrics, cell-type annotations, gene co-expression and chro-\nmatin accessibility magnitude estimates. Finally, the microbiome \nbrowser contains metagenomic and metatranscriptomic boxplots \n(https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Microbiome/) from each \ntimepoint of the study, spanning eight skin locations, deltoid swabs \ncollected pre-skin biopsy, swabs of the SpaceX Dragon capsule and \nstool samples.\nThe remaining biospecimens from this study have been preserved \nand catalogued for continued use by the scientific community \n(https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/). These samples include venous \nblood plasma, venous blood serum, viably frozen PBMCs, vacutainer \nred blood cell pellets, urine (both crude and with nucleic acid pre-\nservative), extracted saliva nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), extracted \nwhole-blood total RNA, extracted skin swab nucleic acids (DNA and \nRNA) and extracted stool nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). A subset of \nthese samples will be available for additional assays and hypoth-\nesis testing by other groups, and the remainder are allocated for \nlong-term biobanking. These data and specimen resources for astro-\nnauts can help enable larger cohorts for increased statistical power \nand also for new biomedical technologies that will emerge in the \nfuture.\nI4\nI4\nCD4 T cell\nI4\nNASA\nTwins\nI4\nNASA\nTwins\ncfRNA\nI4\nJAXA\nCFE\nMixed cell type\nI4\nNASA\nTwins\nProteomics\nI4\nFP1\nFP1\nFP1\nReturn\nversus\npre-ﬂight\nFP1\nReturn\nversus\npre-ﬂight\nFP1\nPre-ﬂight\nversus\npost-ﬂight\nFP1\nReturn\nversus\npre-ﬂight\nFP1\nFP1\nReactome IL-17 signalling\nKEGG neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction\nHP mitochondrial respiratory chain defects\nNemeth inﬂammatory response LPS UP\nGOBP positive regulation of inﬂammatory response\nSesto response to UV C2\nPID IL-6–IL-7 pathway\nGOBP regulation of phagocytosis\nWP microglia pathogen phagocytosis pathway\nGOBP nervous system process\nMikkelsen NPC HCP with H3K27me3\nRaghavachari platelet-speciﬁc genes\nKEGG lysosome\nGOBP sensory perception of smell\nGOBP innate immune response in mucosa\nReactome viral infection pathways\nKEGG spliceosome\nGnatenko platelet signature\nWP cell lineage map for neuronal differentiation\nReactome FCERI-mediated MAPK activation\nHP mitochondrial inheritance\nReactome response to elevated platelet cytosolic CA2\nGOBP antibacterial humoral response\nHP abnormal haemoglobin\nReactome binding and uptake of ligands by scavenger receptors\nReactome FCERI-mediated NF-κB activation\nGOMF antigen binding\nPathway\n–2.5\n–0.5\n0.5\n2.5\nNormalized enrichment score\nP value\n0.05\n0.01\n0.001\n<0.0001\n0\n4\n8\nCount\nDirection\nPositive\nNegative\nCD14\nmonocyte\nCD16\nmonocyte\nCD8 T cell\nPlasma\nEVP\nFig. 5 | Pathway enrichment of most variable genes.

In addition, we have demonstrated \nthat short-duration, high-elevation (585 km) spaceflight results in \nbroad-ranging molecular changes, in which some of these changes \nmirror what has been observed during longer-duration spaceflight, \nincluding elevated cytokines, telomere elongation and gene expres-\nsion changes for immune activation, DNA damage response and oxi-\ndative stress. Although more than 95% of markers return to baseline \nin the months after the mission had ended, some proteins, genes and \ncytokines appear to be activated only in the recovery period after space-\nflight and persist post-flight for at least 3 months.\nThese results collectively indicate a dynamic recovery profile that \nsubstantially reverses the direction of differential gene expression in \nmultiple key biological pathways from the post-flight timepoint (R+1) \nand afterward. This suggests that re-adaptation to Earth activates a \nrange of restorative mechanisms that help to recover, at least in part, \nthe physiological stress imposed by exposure to the space environ-\nment. The systematic analysis of the molecular and cellular changes \nobserved post-flight afford us with a unique opportunity to capture \nnaturally occurring health-restoring mechanisms, which can be used \nfor therapeutic target discovery. Furthermore, we observed a nuanced \nregulatory landscape, in which enriched recovery pathways are both \nunique to individual cell types and span cell types in unique combina-\ntions. We have carefully indexed various profiles for flight, recovery and \nlongitudinal analysis that are annotated in processed data files available \nin the NASA OSDR. The RP1 profile indicates that we need more frequent \nsampling in the 1–2 months directly after flight to untangle the gene \nand pathway responses during re-adaptation from spaceflight. This \nwill be especially true during longer missions, in which re-adaptation \nwill probably be more intense.\nOf note, these data are, to our knowledge, the first-ever joint single- \nnucleus chromatin profiles (RNA and ATAC) for astronauts, and they \nalso leverage new methods that can track gene expression and epige-\nnetic changes within the same cells. This single-cell, dual-measurement \nassay provides new data on the molecular changes and regulatory \nresponse to spaceflight (for example, chromatin and TFBS accessibil-\nity), and the data revealed distinct levels of stress and adaptation by \neach cell type. Specifically, the T cell and monocyte cell populations \n(CD14 and CD16) had the largest changes in expression and response \nof any cell type. The differences between PBMC subpopulations also \nsuggest that single-cell sequencing can be helpful for delineating \nunique cell-type responses in future studies as well. Indeed, although \nthe immune system and haematopoietic systems both show thousands \nof transient changes at the gene expression level, the chromatin archi-\ntecture is distinctly disrupted, in both scale and duration, in these CD14+ \nand CD16+ monocyte populations. These cell types were also found to \nbe disrupted in the NASA Twins Study7,23, and thus represent a key cell \ntype to be studied for future missions.\nThe cfRNA, dRNA and spatial RNA profiles revealed unique profiles \nthat differed based on recovery and longitudinal analysis, suggesting \nthat the multi-omic footprint of spaceflight is much wider than previ-\nously observed. Although some focused studies of cfRNA have shown \nthat it can be used to detect mitochondrial increase in blood related \nto spaceflight7–9,24, to our knowledge, it had never been applied as a \n‘full-body molecular scan’ to detect differential tissue and cell stress. \nOf note, the SOMA resource enables comparisons of the cfRNAs and \ncell-encapsulated RNAs, as well as the exosomal fractions, all within \nthe same framework, which is essential for delineating and ranking the \ncells and tissues in the body that are the most disrupted by spaceflight. \nSimilar to the utility of single-cell data23, the granularity of seeing cell \nlysis from all tissues across the body in one assay makes cfRNA profil-\ning an ideal addition to some of the proposed standard measures for \nspaceflight monitoring. So far, cfRNA data indicate that each part of \nthe body may show its own transcriptional response, shedding rate \nor RNA excretion rates, and thus each tissue should be examined on \nits own and then compared with other sites and assays. Similarly, in \nthe microbiome data, the taxonomic classifications yielded differ-\nences in variation by body site, timepoint and crew member (Extended \nData Fig. 8), indicating the need for multi-site and multi-omic sam-\npling for ideal understanding of microbiome changes associated with \nspaceflight.\nHowever, this study is not without limitations. Although cell-specific \ncomparisons could be made between the I4 mission and previous \nstudies, the assays and collection protocols were slightly different \n(for example, column purification versus droplet-sorted cells), and \nthus comparisons will be imperfect. In addition, although the same \ntube types and methods were used whenever possible, cross-mission \ncomparisons will inevitably include noise from various other types of \ntechnical variation, including batches of library preparation and extrac-\ntion kits, slightly different collection intervals (L−3 versus L−10) and \ndifferent sequencing or profiling technologies (for example, Illumina \nversus Ultima or liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry \nversus NULISASeq). Finally, as our comparisons to other NASA and JAXA \ndatasets span, at most, 64 astronauts, these data are not sufficient to \nguide medical interventions or inference of mechanisms. As such, these \nSOMA data and resources should be viewed as preliminary molecular \nmaps of the response of the human body to spaceflight.\nFuture directions\nNonetheless, the data from the I4 mission will be an invaluable \nresource for future studies. Deep analyses of secretome profiling25, \nsingle-nucleus multiome26, viral activation and ecological restructur-\ning27, skin spatial transcriptomic profiling28, epitranscriptomic profil-\ning22, and genome integrity and clonal haematopoiesis29 have already \nleveraged this resource. In future missions, additional biomedical pro-\nfiling can help to delineate the short-term and long-term health effects \nof spaceflight, including changes in telomere length dynamics, DNA \nmethylation, non-coding RNAs, as well as additional sample types, \nsuch as hair follicles, tears, sperm and other biospecimens. Indeed, \nthe remaining samples from the I4 mission have been biobanked for \njust this reason and to help the scientific community tackle future \nobjectives12. In addition, aliquots of DNA, RNA, protein, serum, urine \nand stool from the protocols performed in this paper have acquired \nconsent for release and are available (https://cambank.weill.cornell.\nedu/) for request, in which researchers can then append new results \nto this extensible SOMA repository.\nDifferences between the biomedical and cellular responses of crew \nmembers may be caused by several factors, including inter-individual \ngenetic differences (Fig. 5), the duration of the mission, the higher \nflight elevation (585 km), the unique environment of the SpaceX \nDragon capsule, or a combination of these and other factors. To \naddress these hypotheses, other molecular assays can be informa-\ntive for future missions, including other epigenetics and chromatin \nconformation assays. For example, we have investigated using the \nmethod cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (Cut&Run) \nto profile histone modifications using 5,000 and 10,000 T cells as \nassay input (Supplementary Fig. 3a), down from the 10 million cells \nrecommended in the original protocol30. T cells were collected \nfrom C002 during the R+194 recovery timepoint, but showed high \nvariance at lower input. Nonetheless, the combination of current \nmodifications profiled can be used to annotate active enhancer \nregions in the genome (Supplementary Fig. 3b), which is a novel pro-\nfile for astronauts, and opens the door to better understanding of \nthe gene-regulatory changes induced by spaceflight for each crew \nmember.\n\nNature  |  Vol 632  |  29 August 2024  |  1153\nMolecular changes described here can also help to guide research \nand countermeasure development, but are only the start of the process \nof mitigating risks, especially as year-long and multi-year space habitat \nmissions will represent greater biomedical challenges. To aid in this \neffort, the SOMA resource will continue to expand as further samples \nare sequenced from the I4 mission11,12 and samples are collected from \nfuture missions that travel farther into space, and then compared with \nother longitudinal, multi-omics cohorts31. Biospecimen samples have \nbeen collected and processed from Polaris and Axiom crews, and this \nAtlas also represents an open call for research participation for astro-\nnauts from any commercial or governmental programs.\nFinally, although the multi-omic data and resources from the I4 crew \nrepresent the largest release of data from astronauts to date, the I4 \ncrew is still a small cohort, and represents only the first step towards \nresolving the many hazards and needs for long-term missions32, build-\ning towards enough statistical power and contextualization of normal \nhuman biological variation33,34. Fortunately, one of the crew mem-\nbers for I4 will continue to donate to the SOMA Biobank for multiple \nmissions, including the Polaris Dawn mission, and data and samples \nfrom additional crews (for example, long-term Twins Study follow-up, \nAxiom Saudi, JAXA and Malta missions) are now being collected and \nintegrated. These cross-mission datasets create a unique opportu-\nnity for long-term, in-depth analysis of the effect of spaceflight on the \nhuman body. Such data are especially important as missions travel \nfarther away from Earth35 and for longer periods of time, in which the \ndata and biomedical discoveries can help to prepare commercial and \nstate-sponsored agencies for the lunar, Mars and exploration-class \nmissions.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa-\nries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl-\nedgements, peer review information; details of author contributions \nand competing interests; and statements of data and code availability \nare available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07639-y.\n1.\t\nBushnell, D.

All crew members consented to data and sample sharing.\nI4 data compendium data generation\nFull methodology for sample preparation, nucleic acid/protein \nextraction, sequencing, mass spectrometry and analysis are reported \nin Supplementary Note 1. Sample collection has been previously \nreported12.\nI4 versus NASA Twins Study cytokine analysis\nDifferential abundance analyses of cytokines and other analytes were \nconducted using a mixed-effects model. This model included fixed \neffects for time, treated as a categorical variable with levels correspond-\ning to preflight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), immediate return (R+1) and recov-\nery periods (R+45, R+82 and R+194). In addition, participant-specific \neffects were incorporated as random effects in the model. The P values \nfor the coefficients obtained from this model were adjusted for multiple \ncomparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.\n10x Genomics snRNA-seq negative control data\nWe acquired cryovials of PBMCs from a healthy man 22 years of age \n(AllCells) and stored them in vapour-phase liquid nitrogen cryotanks. \nTwo cryovials from this donor were thawed and processed on two dif-\nferent days in the same week, at the same laboratory, using the 10x \nGenomics demonstrated protocol called Nuclei Isolation for Single \nCell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000365). From \neach day’s nuclei suspension, ATAC and gene expression libraries were \ngenerated (in technical triplicates on the same chip) according to the \nChromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User \nGuide (CG000338) and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencer. The \nresulting single-nucleus GEX and single-nucleus ATAC files were aligned \nusing the cellranger-arc pipeline (v2.0.2) from 10x Genomics against \nthe human reference genome hg38. Quality control and cell annotation \nwere performed on the snGEX gene-cell matrices using the R Seurat \npackage (v4.2.0)36. Subpopulations were clustered and labelled using a \npublicly available Azimuth human PBMC reference37 in conjunction with \nSeurat’s supervised clustering functionality. DEG analysis for labelled \nsubpopulations was performed using the FindMarkers functionality of \nSeurat, with a log fold change (logFC) cut-off point of 0.5. P values of \nresultant genes were measured using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and \ndeemed significant for P < 0.05. Correlation of chromatin accessibility \nand gene expression changes in FP1 was characterized by summing \nup the accessibility in a promoter window consisting of the transcrip-\ntion start site ± 500 bp for every cell in a given cell type across every \ngene, normalizing it to counts per million, taking the log2 difference \nbetween the different timepoints and matching it to the log2FC from \nthe differential RNA analysis.\nRecovery profile analysis\nDEGs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data \nwere filtered for |logFC| > 0.5 and adjusted P < 0.05 for the FP1, RP1, RP2 \nand LP2 profiles. An UpSet plot of shared genes was generated using \nIntervene38. Overrepresented pathways were calculated using Web­\nGestalt39 using the default parameters and the KEGG database. Pathways \nincluded in the analysis were within the top 40 lowest false discovery \nrate values or all pathways with a false discovery rate under 0.05.\nTranscription factor motif accessibility analysis\nchromVAR40 was used for the analysis of sparse chromatin accessibility \nfrom 10x Genomics single-cell data. The FindMarkers function of the \nSeurat package was used for differential analysis with setting mean.\nfxn as rowMeans and fc.name = “avg_diff”. The top five differentially \naccessible transcription factor motifs from each cell type from the \nPBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data for the FP1, RP1 and RP2 were \nselected for visualization by heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated by \nthe ComplexHeatmap R package.\nCalculation of individual variation\nTo distinguish the analytes that varied with the greatest magnitude \nbetween individual crew members (C001, C002, C003 and C004), a \ncoefficient of variation (CV) calculation was applied across measure-\nments collected for each: metagenomic species, metatranscriptomic \nspecies, plasma protein abundance, EVP protein abundance, metabolite \nabundance, cytokine abundances (Alamar Bio) and gene expression val-\nues (Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq). CV calculations \nwere performed using the formula ‘np.std(x, ddof = 0)/np.mean(x)’, \nwhere ‘x’ is the array of normalized analyte values and ‘np’ refers to the \nnumpy scientific computing package (v = 1.26). CV calculations were \nsplit into pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), post-flight (R+1) and recovery \n(R+45 and R+82) intervals. The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic \ndata also include the in-flight (FD2 and FD3) interval.\nBefore performing the CV calculation, data were first normalized. The \n‘limma’ R package was applied to the plasma proteomic, EVP proteomic \nand metabolite data (v3.52). DESeq2 (v1.36.0) was applied to the Oxford \nNanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq data. For microbiome data, \nto measure individual contributions per astronaut and for each tissue \ntype (‘armpit’, ‘forearm’, ‘nasal’, ‘oral’, ‘post-auricular’, ‘T-zone’, among \nothers), we averaged MetaPhlAn4, species-level, relative abundance \nvalues across our collected sample points. CVs were calculated for \nindividual genes, proteins and microbial organisms.\nAn abundance standardized CV calculation was also performed to \ncorrect for the mean/CV relationship in the assays. First, the normal-\nized abundance values across all the analytes of a given dataset were \nsplit into approximately 100 mean-abundance quantiles (M_q where q \nis 1–100 or fewer, in case it resulted in less than 10 points per quantile \ngroup). For each quantile group, the mean and the standard deviation of \nCV values for the analytes belonging to M_q were calculated (CVmean_q \nand CVs.d._q, respectively) to prepare the mean/CV distribution refer-\nence set across all timepoints and samples. Then, for a given timepoint, \nthe CV calculated for each analyte was matched to the corresponding \nCVmean_q and CVs.d._q based on cross-referencing to the M_q interval \noverlap. Finally, the abundance standardized CV was calculated as the \nz score of the CV as (CV − CVmean_q)/(CVs.d._q). Permutation testing \nof the post-flight versus pre-flight difference was performed by repeat-\ning this procedure 10,000 times on shuffled labels for samples, taking \nthe difference. Rank and z score of the observed value were calculated \nagainst the random permutations to order the genes and used as input \nto fGSEA for pathway enrichment analysis. Gene Ontology analysis on \nabundance standardized CVs was performed with Enrichr41,42 using \nthe default settings.\nAdditional methods and details\nIn-depth methods and protocol information for all assays in Fig. 1a is \nlocated in Supplementary Note 1.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Port-\nfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nDatasets have been uploaded to two data repositories: the NASA OSDR \n(https://osdr.nasa.gov; comprising NASA GeneLab15 and the NASA Ames \nLife Sciences Data Archive16,32).

(a) Patterns of gene \nexpression across seven time points and 13 comparisons. Left: z-scored \nlog-transformed normalized gene counts obtained from salmon (bottom left \nof each cell) and featureCounts (top right of each cell). Right: log2(fold-change) \nvalues obtained from edgeR (bottom left of each cell) and from DESeq2  \n(top right of each cell). The genes are clustered by z-scored log-transformed \nnormalized counts using the correlation distance metric. (b) Patterns of \nbase-level m6A modifications across seven time points and 13 comparisons. \nLeft: z-scored log-transformed positional methylation probabilities obtained \nfrom m6anet.

The sites are \nclustered by the pattern of differential methylation across all comparisons \nusing the correlation distance metric. On both panes (a) and (b), only the genes \nand sites with significant differences in expression and/or methylation in at \nleast one comparison are plotted; the significance of individual comparisons  \nis annotated with up and down arrows.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 5 | Single-Nuclei RNA-Sequencing Controls. (a) The \nnumber of DEGs in I4 flight profiles (FP1: grouped crew or individual crew \nmembers), I4 longitudinal profiles (LP3: grouped crew or individual crew \nmembers), and negative control groups (mock control day 2 vs day 1, mock \ncontrol same day technical replicate differences, and I4 inter-subject \ncomparisons in preflight). All comparisons were done with downsampling  \nto the same number of cells. Intra-timepoint subject comparisons are crew-to- \ncrew comparison in the pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3), immediately post-flight \n(R + 1), and recovery (R + 45, R + 82) time intervals. The bars show the mean of \nthe total number of DEGs, and error bars show the standard error for groups \nthat have 3 or more comparisons summarized. (n = 4 independent subjects \nwith 6 timepoints, and n = 1 control subject with 2 timepoints and 3 technical \nscRNAseq replicates for each timepoint.) (b) The number of total DEGs identified \nby DESeq2 and pseudobulk counts in I4 flight profiles (FP1), I4 longitudinal \nprofiles (LP3), and negative control groups (mock control day 2 vs day 1). All \ncomparisons were done with aggregation into a single sample for each crew \nand each cell type. The bars show the mean of the total number of DEGs. (c) DEG \ndirectionality heatmap represents the overlap of up-regulated (orange) and \ndown-regulated (purple) DEGs across comparison groups (I4 timepoint \ncomparisons, I4 individual variation, 10x negative controls).
