Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a
leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered
from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic
and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut
health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference
strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic
resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine
their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged
with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of
the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the
culmination of this study, there were no deﬁning signatures that separated known
pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available
resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be
shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically
relevant microorganisms.

INTRODUCTION
Enterococcus faecalis represent a core, yet quantitatively minor portion of the human gut
microbiome (Schloissnig et al., 2013) that are well suited to persist outside of the host environment.
Evidence recently emerged that the enterococci may have split from their last common ancestor
at approximately the time animal life began to colonize terrestrial habitats (∼425 million years
ago), and traits that promote survival and transmission in the exposed land environment selected
for the characteristic ruggedness of the genus (Lebreton et al., 2017). Supporting that proposition,

enterococci display signiﬁcantly higher levels of resistance to a
variety of antiseptics, salts, organic compounds, desiccation, and
starvation than ancestral outgroups (Lebreton et al., 2017).
Because traits contributing to environmental persistence
also contribute to persistence in the hospital environment,
enterococci rank among leading causes of healthcare associated
infections (Weiner et al., 2016). While certain strains of
E. faecalis are pathogenic for hospitalized patients, e.g., MMH594
(Huycke et al., 1991) and V583 (Sahm et al., 1989), and
possess genomes swollen to 3.3 Mb by the accretion of mobile
genetic elements (MGEs), the genomes of commensal isolates
are 25% smaller, as typiﬁed by the strain OG1RF (Bourgogne
et al., 2008). In the antibiotic era, loss of CRISPR (clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) protection of the
chromosome further facilitated the accumulation of additional
antibiotic resistance by enterococci (Fiore et al., 2019). Several
other MGEs have been directly linked to virulence factors
(Shankar et al., 2002), however, the selective value of most
mobile elements in clinical isolates of enterococci remains
to be determined.
The ISS provides a unique opportunity to study the
establishment of a microbiome in what originated as a clean,
hermetically sealed built environment, where the inﬂux of new
microorganisms only occurs periodically with the arrival of
new crew and supplies. The microbiome of the ISS has been
extensively characterized in recent years by metagenomic (Be
et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018b; Urbaniak
et al., 2018; Blaustein et al., 2019; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaﬀet al.,
2019) and culture-based investigations (Schiwon et al., 2013;
Venkateswaran, 2017; Singh et al., 2018a; Blaustein et al., 2019;
Mora et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019),
yet only recently have these eﬀort been combined (Mora et al.,
2019; Sielaﬀet al., 2019). The results are divided among those
that report similarities to Earth built environments (Schiwon
et al., 2013; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaﬀet al., 2019) including
United States based spacecraft assembly cleanrooms (Be et al.,
2017), and those that detected signiﬁcant diﬀerences from
terrestrial residences, the Human Microbiome Project (Lang
et al., 2017), the Japan-based ISS analog module (Ichijo et al.,
2016), and a French Guiana-based cleanroom (Mora et al.,
2019). Despite the diﬀerences in methodologies and results, the
detection of opportunistic human pathogens (Schiwon et al.,
2013; Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Mora et al., 2019;
Singh et al., 2018a,b; Sielaﬀet al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019;
Urbaniak et al., 2019) including E. faecalis, is a common
phenomenon. With the exception of Be et al. (2017), the
previous metagenomic eﬀorts were limited to characterizing
diversity at the genus level or identifying antibiotic resistance or
virulence gene content, and thereby lacked the genetic resolution
to conﬁdently identify pathogenic bacterial strains. While
genome-based pathogenicity analyses have been performed for
Staphylococcus aureus (Blaustein et al., 2019) and Enterobacter
bugandensis (Singh et al., 2018a), only a single culture-based
report has quantiﬁed pathogenicity (Fusarium oxysporum isolates
from the ISS Urbaniak et al., 2019) in a host model. As a result,
the ability to predict how opportunistic pathogens may impact
crew health remains unclear.
In addition to characterizing the microbiome of the ISS,
understanding the eﬀects of spaceﬂight on bacterial physiology
will be imperative for assessing the impacts on crew health.
When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was exposed to spaceﬂight, there
was an increase in the total cell viable numbers, biomass,
bioﬁlm thickness, and the cells produced a unique bioﬁlm
architecture not seen in ground controls of the species (Mclean
et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2013). Su et al. (2014) documented
growth curve, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations (related
to amino acid transport, metabolism, energy production, and
conversion) in Bacillus cereus and Serratia marcescens during
spaceﬂight (Wang et al., 2014). Carbon utilization proﬁles
were altered among S. marcescens clones after ﬂight, and
transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed signiﬁcant changes
in metabolic functions (Wang et al., 2014). Additionally,
Wilson et al. (2007) utilized proteomic analysis and expression
proﬁles to demonstrate that changes in genomic regulation of
Salmonella typhymurium were widely distributed, and virulence
was increased in response to spaceﬂight. Although Hammond
et al. (2013) report a signiﬁcant decrease in E. faecalis OG1RF
virulence when grown under spaceﬂight conditions, this was
inferred by a reduction in the optical density of cultures
grown in the presence of adult Caenorhabditis elegans rather
than worm viability.
In addition to altered microbial physiological responses,
astronaut health is also impacted by the spaceﬂight environment.
Factors such as microgravity, physiological stress, isolation,
abnormal circadian rhythms, and altered nutrition have been
shown to weaken an astronaut’s immunity in as little as 10 to
15 days (Crucian et al., 2013), and these eﬀects can persist up to
6 months post mission ISS (Crucian et al., 2015). This weakened
immunity, combined with the prevalence of E. faecalis strains, or
other potential pathogens including viruses (Rooney et al., 2019),
could result in severe human health consequences on board the
ISS, even in incidences of routine medicinal procedures (i.e., the
introduction of a percutaneous catheter Mermel, 2012).
With the detection of enterococci, we sought to determine
the risk they posed to residents within the ISS – speciﬁcally, do
they represent pathogenic lineages commonly associated with
infections in hospitals, or do they represent commensals shed
into the environment as a consequence of human habitation?
In order to determine if the challenging environment of the
air and surfaces of the ISS have selected for pathogenic strains
of E. faecalis, we coupled previously employed genomic data
analyses (Singh et al., 2018a) with phenotypic characterization of
E. faecalis isolates recovered onboard the ISS. By assessing their
antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, and pathogenicity in
the well-established C. elegans model (Garsin et al., 2001), we
sought to test existing methods for identiﬁcation of strains of
E. faecalis with a high likelihood of causing in-ﬂight infections.

as
previously described (Castro et al., 2004). E. faecalis isolates
OG1RF, MMH594, V583, and the genome sequences of
E. faecalis 5952 and JH-1 were made available from the Gilmore
lab strain collection. All additional available whole genomes of
E. faecalis (N = 44) were obtained from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
Except where described below, cultures of E. faecalis OG1RF,
MMH594, V583, and the ISS isolates (Table 1) were grown
aerobically with shaking (250 RPM) at 37◦C in brain heart
infusion (BHI; DifcoTM, cat. no: 237500) broth. Growth kinetics
for each isolate was assessed using a Synergy 2 microplate reader
(Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.), measuring optical density at 620 nm.
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for various antibiotics
was evaluated in both Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth or in BHI, as
further detailed below. For the desiccation experiments, isolates
were grown overnight in a chemically deﬁned medium (CDM;
Hussain et al., 1991) and plated onto M9 (DifcoTM, cat. no:
237500) agar plates amended with 1.0% glucose. To perform the
C. elegans pathogenicity assays, cultures of Escherichia coli OP50
were prepared on nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates as
previously described (Powell and Ausubel, 2008).
Genome Sequencing of ISS Strains
For preparation of DNA, isolates were grown overnight in BHI
broth. Cells were lysed using lysozyme (50 µg mL−1) and
mutanolysin (2500 U mL−1), and the total DNA was isolated
using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen©, cat. no: 69504).
Puriﬁed DNA was used for preparing libraries, which were then
sequenced on Illumina HiSeq (250 nucleotide paired end reads)
as previously described (Supplementary Table S1 in Lebreton
et al., 2017).
Additionally, a MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies©;
ONT) library was prepared using the “one-pot” barcoding
protocol, as developed by Josh Quick and the Loman Lab1. For
each isolate, 24 µL of AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter
R⃝Life
Sciences cat. no.: A63880) eluate was used as input for library
preparation. This was incubated at room temperature (RT) for
5 min, 65◦C for 5 min, then placed on ice for 30 s. Samples were
barcoded using the Rapid Barcoding Kit (ONT cat. no.: SQK-
RBK001) and each was incubated at RT for 10 min, 70◦C for
5 min, then placed on ice. The reaction product was then pooled
with other samples (N = 4 total) in a clean 1.5 mL low-bind
Eppendorf tube, before addition of 26.75 µl AMPure XP beads
per sample. This was incubated at RT for 5 min, placed on the
magnet rack until clear, and the supernatant removed. The beads
were washed with 200 µl 70% ethanol, incubated for 30 s, and the
supernatant removed (2X) before spinning down and removal of
the residual 70% ethanol. After air drying for 1 min, the beads
were resuspended in 31 µl elution buﬀer (EB, 10 mM Tris–HCl
pH 8), incubated oﬀthe magnet rack for 5 min, returned to

the rack. DNA was quantiﬁed by ﬂuorescence (ThermoFisher
Scientiﬁc© Qubit 3.0 with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit; cat. no.:
Q32854) and the sequencing adaptors were ligated (ONT cat.
no.: SQK-LSK109) following the manufacturer’s protocols. This
tube was incubated at RT for 10 min, 45.5 µl AMPure XP beads
added, incubated for another 5 min, placed on magnet rack
until clear, and the supernatant removed. Next, 150 µl ABB was
added and the beads resuspended by ﬂicking, before placing the
tube back on the magnet rack until clear. The supernatant was
removed and the ABB wash repeated before spinning down the
tube and removing the residual supernatant. Next, 12 ul EB was
added and the bead resuspended by ﬂicking before incubation
at RT for 5 min. The tube was placed again on the magnet
rack until clear, and the elution library was loaded on to an
ONT MinION ﬂow cell (R9.4.1) according to the manufacturer’s
protocols and sequenced using MinKNOW (v1.11.5) with live
basecalling (Supplementary Table S2). Output fastq ﬁles were
concatenated and adaptors were removed and debarcoded with
PoreChop (v0.2.32). Reads were quality ﬁltered (≥Q9) using
NanoFilt (v2.2.0), and NanoPlot (v1.13.0) was then used to
characterize sequencing datasets (De Coster et al., 2018).
Genome Assembly
Unicycler (v0.4.4) was used for long-read and hybrid assembly
using default parameters, with the initial long-read assembly
speciﬁed via the –existing_long_read_assembly ﬂag for hybrid
assembly (Wick et al., 2017). BWA (v0.7.17-r1188 with -x ont2d
ﬂag; docker container alexcoppe/bwa:latest) was used to map
long reads onto the hybrid assembly to inspect assemblies and
verify lack of evidence of mis-assemblies based on coverage.
CheckM (v1.0.7) was used to evaluate completeness of ﬁnal
hybrid assemblies described in Table 1 (Parks et al., 2015).
Pangenomic and Phylogenetic Analysis
Genomes were annotated using Prokka (v.1.14.6; docker
container
quay.io/biocontainers/prokka:1.14.6–pl526_0
Seemann, 2014), and the pangenome analysis was performed
using Roary (v3.12.0; docker container staphb/roary:3.12.0 Page
et al., 2015). Genes that were present in a single isolate were
deﬁned as unique genes and, for strains utilized in this study,
their identities were further examined by BLASTn (Altschul
et al., 1990) for comparison to the NCBI non-redundant
database. Based on DNA sequence comparison, an E. faecalis
phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A) was constructed from the Roary-
determined core gene alignment (1.69 Mb) using FastTree
(docker container staphb/fasttree:2.1.11) using the General Time
Invariant (GTR) model, and visualized using IcyTree (Vaughan,
2017). For a list of all genomes and gene presence/absence data
see Supplementary Data File S1.
Comparative Genomic Analysis
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed by evaluating
seven E. faecalis genes (aroE, gdh, gki, gyd, pstS, xpt, and yqiL)
and sequence types (STs) assigned based on the alleles present
in each genome (Larsen et al., 2012). The potential presence

Enterococcus faecalis on the ISS
FIGURE 2 | Whole genome analysis of Enterococcus faecalis. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of E. faecalis strains was determined based on FastTree
generalized-time-reversible (GTR) analysis of SNPs present in the 1,844 core genes as determined by Roary (Page et al., 2015) and visualized with IcyTree (Vaughan,
2017). The alignment, when corrected for gaps and ambiguous bases, was 1.69 Mb. Branch support was 100% except as indicated. Isolates used in this study are
indicated in bold. Asterisk (*) denotes an unﬁnished genome assembly (contigs). Clinical isolates that are phylogenetic neighbors of the ISS isolates are tagged with

of plasmids was assessed using PlasmidFinder (Carattoli et al.,
2014). VirFinder was used to detect potential E. faecalis virulence
factor genes (Joensen et al., 2014), and PathogenFinder provided
a predictive score for each strain’s potential pathogenicity for
humans (Cosentino et al., 2013). Additionally, the web server
PHAge Search Tool – Enhanced Release (PHASTER) was used to
detect the presence of phage sequences within bacterial genomic
data (Arndt et al., 2016), and the Comprehensive Antibiotic
Resistance Database (CARD) was used to identify genes
potentially associated with antimicrobial resistance (Jia et al.,
2016). The presence of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats) arrays and Cas (CRISPR associated
proteins) was detected using the online tool, CRISPRCasFinder
(Couvin et al., 2018). Capsule type polymorphisms were
determined as described by McBride et al. (2007). Brieﬂy the
presence, or absence, of genes in the locus (EF2485 to EF2495)
were veriﬁed in the genomes of each isolate. CPS type 1 strains
are deﬁned as isolates with cpsA and B, and hcp1 (EF2484), while
CPS type 2 strains consist of the full cps locus and hcp1 (EF2484 to
EF2495). CPS type 5 strains are similar to the type 2 gene proﬁle,
but do not contain cpsF (EF0090).
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of
Antibiotics
Antibiotic MIC was determined by broth microdilution as
described (CLSI, 2017). Brieﬂy, overnight cultures of isolates
were diluted and 104 cells in MH broth were inoculated into
each well of 96 well plates containing serial 2-fold dilutions of
antibiotics. Maximum concentration tested: penicillin (10 µg
mL−1), amoxicillin (10 µg mL−1), ampicillin (10 µg mL−1),
oxacillin (256 µg mL−1), erythromycin (50 µg mL−1), and
tetracycline (64 µg mL−1). This procedure was repeated in BHI
(McBride et al., 2007), and isolates were additionally evaluated for
high level aminoglycoside resistance (HLGR) with: gentamicin,
streptomycin, and kanamycin (each at a maximum concentration
of 2 mg mL−1). Plates were incubated at 37◦C and growth was
monitored at 24 and 48 h. Wells containing the lowest antibiotic
concentration lacking growth after 48 h were designated the MIC
for the respective antibiotics.
Desiccation Survival
Survival to desiccation was assessed as previously described
(Lebreton et al., 2017; Bryan et al., 2019) with the following
modiﬁcations.
E.
faecalis
isolates
were
harvested
from
stationary phase by centrifugation, and washed twice with
sterile (autoclaved, 0.22 µm ﬁltered) water (sH2O). Prior to
desiccation, the concentrated cells were resuspended in CDM,
and a 10 µL sample was track diluted (Jett et al., 1997) onto
M9 medium (M9; Amresco
R⃝, cat. no.: J863-500G) amended
with 0.1% glucose agar, and incubated at 37◦C. After ∼24 h,
the number of CFUs recovered from 10 µL track dilutions
prepared according to Jett et al. (1997) were used to determine

the original concentration of cells mL−1 (t = −1). Aliquots of
cell suspensions (50 µL) were spotted onto autoclaved coverslips,
and placed into the desiccation chamber containing Drierite
R⃝
(≥98% CaSO4, W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Ltd., cat.
no.: 778-18-9) until the liquid evaporated (t = 0, 24 h). The
relative humidity (RH) in the chamber was monitored using a
digital hygrometer, and maintained between 30-40% by adding
additional Drierite
R⃝. Three replicates were prepared for each
isolate at each timepoint. The dried cells were removed from the
coverslips by rinsing and resuspending the material with a pipet
into 1 mL of sH2O. To ensure the samples were homogenously
resuspended, rehydrated cells were incubated at 37◦C for 1 h
while shaking (225 RPM), and vortexed for 15 minutes. The
cells were then serially diluted into sH2O and 10 µL track
dilutions were plated onto M9 agar. At the t = 0 time point, the
number of CFUs recovered from the substrate was designated
as the starting population size that survived the initial drying
on the coverslip (N0). Subsequent samples were removed from
the desiccation chamber every three days and rehydrated as
described above to determine the number of surviving CFUs
over time (N). The surviving fraction of cells was determined
from the ratio of N/N0. Each time point was evaluated when N
was ≥30 CFU.
Pathogenicity of E. faecalis isolates in a
C. elegans model
Nematode killing assays were performed as previously described
(Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). Brieﬂy, C. elegans fer-15;fem-1
(CF512) worms were grown on NGM inoculated with E. coli
strain OP50 and incubated at 15◦C until they reached the
L4 stage. Approximately 30–40 of the L4 stage worms were
then transferred to BHI agar plates (amended with kanamycin,
10 µg mL−1) inoculated with 100 µL aliquots of each log
phase E. faecalis isolate. The plates were incubated at 25◦C and
worms were examined for viability. Worms that did not exhibit
movement nor respond to physical touch were scored as dead
and removed from the plate. Moving worms were scored as alive
and also counted.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical
analyses
for
the
desiccation
experiments
were
performed using JMP
R⃝Pro v.14.3 (JMP
R⃝, 2019). Prior to
evaluating the data for signiﬁcant diﬀerences, the data were
assessed for equal variances. Subsequent one-way ANOVAs were
performed to determine the signiﬁcant diﬀerences of desiccation
survival at diﬀerent timepoints and among individual isolates.
Post hoc comparisons for time were performed using parametric
comparisons with a control using Dunnett’s method (N = 18
for each isolate, with the exception of t = 12 d where N = 17).
The mean N/N0 for each isolate at t = 21 d was evaluated
using the non-parametric comparison with a control performed
following the Steel method (N = 3 for each isolate). Individual
comparisons for survival at two timepoints were performed
using a homoscedastic Student’s t- test.
The survival of C. elegans on each E. faecalis isolate was
performed in triplicate. A Kaplan-Meier log rank analysis
was performed to evaluate the survival curves using OASIS-2
(Han et al., 2016) as previously described Yuen (Yuen and
Ausubel, 2018). The data were determined to follow the normal
distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test (Han et al., 2016), and
pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni-corrected p-values < 0.05
were considered signiﬁcant. Data are reported as the average and
the standard error (± SE) of the number of worms scored, and is
reported in Table 2.
RESULTS
Isolates Recovered From the ISS
The E. faecalis isolates recovered from air samples (ISS_1 and
ISS_4) were both collected mid-module. ISS_1 was isolated from
air samples collected in the United States Lab in 2009, and ISS_4
was recovered from the air in Node 3 in 2013 (Figure 1). ISS_2
and ISS_3, were two isolates recovered in 2011 from the same
location, United States Lab handrail surfaces, approximately 14
feet apart. One was collected from the aft end of the module
(at the interface with Node 1), and the other was recovered
mid-module. The United States Lab was launched in 2001, and
houses the various science payloads conducting research onboard
the ISS (Singh et al., 2018b). Node 3, launched in 2010, and
houses the air revitalization and water recovery systems, as well
as amenities for crew hygiene, the restrooms, and exercise devices
(Singh et al., 2018b). With preliminary identiﬁcation based solely
on the VITEK identiﬁcation system, the ﬁrst task for the isolate
characterization was to create a fully sequenced genome for each
isolate (Table 1).
Pangenome Analysis
With the complete genomes for each isolate assembled, several
web-based tools were utilized for genomic characterization. First,
seven gene loci were evaluated for their respective MLST using
the web-based MLST server (Table 1; Larsen et al., 2012). ISS_1
was determined to be a single locus variant of sequence type (ST)
875, with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 583
bases of pstS. Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 were identiﬁed as ST30.
ISS_4 was classiﬁed as ST40, a commonly recovered ST and a
member of one of the largest clonal clusters, CC40 (McBride et al.,
2007). A clonal cluster is deﬁned as a ST consisting of three or
more isolates (McBride et al., 2007). CC40 is comprised of ST40
and ST114, many of which were isolated from clinical sources
(McBride et al., 2007).
Based on the ST data described above, representative type
strains were chosen for each as a comparator for each ISS ST
(McBride et al., 2007), and a core genome of 1,844 genes shared
by all 51 strains was deﬁned (Page et al., 2015). An alignment
of the core genome was then used to construct the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 2A). Phylogenetic proximity of the selected type
strains to the ISS isolates validated the selection based on ST.
Genome size and gene count (Figure 2B) show patterns of
genomic expansion and loss within clades; for example, within
the clade containing V583 a general pattern of larger genome size
and higher gene count is evident, yet nearby ISS_1 has a more
streamlined genome in comparison to its neighbors. Genes are

classiﬁed into core, soft core, shell, and cloud on the basis of the
number of isolates sharing each gene (Figure 2C; Supplementary
Figure S1) and the Roary-estimated patterns of gene presence
and absence highlight potential patterns of gene loss or gain
(Supplementary Data File S1).
Unique chromosomal genes, deﬁned as those genes that
were present in a single isolate, were non-uniformly distributed
across each isolate genome (Supplementary Data File S1).
ISS_1 (Accession no.: CP046113) contained the fewest number
of unique genes (11 genes), 9 of which were designated
hypothetical by Prokka (Seemann, 2014) yet had homology
with other E. faecalis genomes on the basis of BLASTn
searches. Seven of the 11 unique genes formed a contiguous
region suggestive of an operon, which contained two genes
with known annotations, mazG, which encodes a nucleoside
triphosphate
pyrophosphohydrolase
involved
in
survival
under nutrient stress, and another that encodes an LPxTG-
motif
protein

protein.
Neither
ISS_2 (Accession no.: CP046112) nor ISS_3 (Accession no.:
CP046111) contained individually unique genes. Consistent
with this ﬁnding, analysis of the core alignment revealed
that isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 diﬀered by only 14 bases.
However, these two isolates shared 39 genes that were not
present in any of the other strains analyzed, of which 30 were
classiﬁed as hypothetical. ISS_4 (Accession no.: CP046108-
110) had 25 unique genes, 16 of which were located on a
plasmid (pTEF2); no unique genes were found on the second
(pAD1) plasmid. Based on BLASTn analysis (Supplementary
Figure S2), the majority of genes unique to the ISS strains
are closely related to genes present in Enterococcus species,
with all non-Enterococcus genera restricted to Lactococcus,
Lactobacillus, and, with lower identity and query coverage,
Listeria (Supplementary Figure S3).
Following the designations of McBride et al. (2007), the
capsule type for each ISS strain was determined. All three
known capsule type polymorphisms were detected from the
ISS strains. ISS_1 contained the full cps locus (EF2485
to EF2495) and hcp1 (EF2484), and similar to MMH594
and V583, was designated CPS type 2. Isolates ISS_2 and
ISS_3 contained the cps locus and hcp1, but lacked cpsF
(EF0090). In agreement with previous analysis of two additional
ST30 isolates (McBride et al., 2007), these strains were
classiﬁed as CPS type 5. The strain ISS_4 contained only
cpsA (EF0095), cpsB (EF0094), and hcp1, and like the other
isolates of CC40 and OG1RF, was classiﬁed as CPS type 1
(McBride et al., 2007).
Assessment of Mobile Elements and
Defense Systems
The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)
database identiﬁed the tetracycline resistance gene, tetW/N/W,
in isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, which was not present in
OG1RF (Jia et al., 2016). The ISS tetW/N/W shared 69.3 (ISS_2
and ISS_3) and 69.1% (ISS_4) sequence homology with the
reference sequence (Accession no.: ARO:3004442). The reference
gene has been detected in 2.70% of the available E. faecalis
isolates surveyed (Jia et al., 2016). A standard nucleotide
BLAST search conﬁrmed the tetW/N/W genes present in ISS_2
and ISS_3 shared 100% sequence identity to each other, and
diﬀered by three SNPs to the tetW/N/W gene present in ISS_4
(Altschul et al., 1990).
PHASTER identiﬁed the presence of intact phage in isolates
ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 (Supplementary Table S3; Arndt et al.,
2016). ISS_2 and ISS_3 each contained three intact phage
nucleotide sequences. The CC40 member ISS_4 contained a
single intact phage region. No intact phage were detected
in either ISS_1 or OG1RF. Thirty two (82%) of the 39
genes shared only by ISS_2 and ISS_3 were associated with
intact or incomplete phage (Supplementary Data File S1).
Plasmid-born genomic elements were only detected in ISS_4
using the tool PlasmidFinder (Table 1; Carattoli et al., 2014).
Two plasmids were determined to share 96.7% sequence
identity, and 99% coverage, to the V583 plasmid pTEF2
(accession number: AE016831; Paulsen et al., 2003), and 96.0%
identity, with 100% coverage, to the pheromone responsive
plasmid pAD1 (accession number: L01794; Ehrenfeld and
Clewell, 1987). Notably, evidence for Lactobacillus prophage
Lj928 was identiﬁed for ISS_2, ISS_3, ISS_4, and V583
(Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, evidence for Enterococcus
phage phiFL4A was identiﬁed for ISS_2, ISS_3, ISS_4, and
MMH594 (Supplementary Table S3). Overall, mobile elements

Enterococcus faecalis on the ISS
explained a majority (65%) of the unique genes identiﬁed in
the ISS isolates. High conﬁdence CRISPR-Cas systems were
detected in isolates ISS_1, ISS_4, and OG1RF (Supplementary
Table S4). CRISPR loci without the Cas genes were detected
in the genomes of each of the ISS isolates and OG1RF
(Supplementary Table S4).
Genome-Based Assessment of the
Potential for Pathogenicity
The PathogenFinder server scored each of the ISS isolates and
the reference strains as potential human pathogens (Table 1;
Cosentino et al., 2013). The commensal strain OG1RF had the
lowest pathogen score of 81.6%. With pathogen scores > 84%,
all of the ISS strains had a higher assigned probability to
be pathogenic than the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583
(each at 82.9%).
By comparing the genomic content of the isolates to
known E. faecalis genes associated with disease, a second
predictor of pathogenicity could be compiled (Table 3; Joensen
et al., 2014). The genomes of the clinical isolates contained
the highest proportion of predicted virulence factors (18/20),
while ISS_2 and ISS_3 contained the least (13/20). ISS_1
and OG1RF both contained 15/20 virulence factors, and the
genome ISS_4 was positive for 16/20. The clinical isolates and
ISS_4 were the only strains to contain agg, encoding for the
E. faecalis aggregation substance involved in bioﬁlm formation,
plasmid transfer, and increased virulence in endocarditis models
(Bhatty et al., 2015).
MMH594 was the only isolate with cylA, one of the genes
responsible for the production of cytolysin. Neither OG1RF nor
the ISS isolates carried any of the genes in the cytolysin pathway
reviewed by Coburn and Gilmore (2003).
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of
Antibiotics
Dilution concentration broth assays were used to determine
the MIC for various antibiotics. Optical density measurements
revealed there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the growth
kinetics between the ISS isolates and the reference strains. Strains
were ﬁrst evaluated in Mueller-Hinton broth for comparison to
clinical laboratory standards for antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis
ATCC
R⃝29212 (CLSI, 2017), and in the commonly used growth
media BHI to determine MICs relative to the commensal isolate
OG1RF. In MH broth, all strains tested exceeded the resistance
levels set forth by ≥2-fold for amoxicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin,
gentamycin, and kanamycin (CLSI, 2017). ISS_2, ISS_3, and
ISS_4 were also categorized as resistant to tetracycline. When
evaluated in BHI, all ISS strains exhibited MICs equivalent
to OG1RF with the exceptions of oxacillin and tetracycline
(Table 4). All ISS strains showed ≥4-fold more resistance
to oxacillin. Isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, each carrying a
tetW/N/W gene, displayed an MIC of 64 µg mL−1. These isolates
were 4-fold more resistant to tetracycline than OG1RF (MIC of
16 µg mL−1), and displayed resistance levels equivalent to the
clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583. Unlike the clinical isolates,
the ISS strains did not exhibit HLGR.
Desiccation Tolerance of E. faecalis
Strains
During the initial 24 h dry down period, the RH in the desiccation
chamber spiked to 56%. For the remainder of the experiment,
the RH was maintained between 30-40% by adding additional
Drierite
R⃝. The concentration of cells surviving the drying process
(N0) ranged from 1.2 (± 0.044) x 1010 to 5.5 (± 0.091) x
107 CFU for ISS-1 and OG1RF, respectively. The average number
of survivors (N) after three weeks of desiccation ranged from 0.11
(± 0.024) to 8.5 (± 0.79) x 108 CFU for OG1RF and MMH594,
respectively. OG1RF demonstrated the greatest loss in viability
during dry down with a 2.1-log reduction, and ISS-2 was the
only isolate that did not experience a signiﬁcant loss in viability
between t = 0 and t = 3 d (p = 0.11). There was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in N/N0 at any of the timepoints evaluated (p = 0.98;
Figure 3). When the variances of N/N0 at t = 21 d for each isolate
were determined to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other
(F = 58, p < 0.001), a non-parametric comparison was performed
with OG1RF chosen as the control using the Steel method. There
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in N/N0 at t = 21 d among the
isolates tested when compared to OG1RF (Figure 3).
Pathogenicity of Isolates in a C. elegans
Model
The survival data (Figure 4) were determined to follow the
normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test (Han et al.,
2016). With the exception of ISS_1, all data are reported as the
mean (± SE) of three replicates. For ISS_1, one sample became
contaminated with fungus on day 9, and all subsequent data are
reported as N = 2. C. elegans was least susceptible to strains ISS_2,
ISS_3, and V583 with mean survival times of 13 (± 0.53), 13
(± 0.59), and 11 (± 0.91) days, respectively (Table 2). While
the time for 50% of the worm population to die (LT50; Garsin
et al., 2001) for these isolates ranged from 9 days (V583) to 14
(ISS_3), the total lifespan of worms challenged with these isolates
were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other. For isolates
ISS_2 and ISS_3, all worms were deceased by day 18 and 17,
respectively. While 90% of worms fed V583 were dead by day 18,
some survivors persisted until day 24. Additionally, the lifespan
of worms infected with ISS_3 was also statistically similar to those
challenged with ISS_4. With a 31% decrease in the mean lifespan,
worms infected with ISS_1 were signiﬁcantly more susceptible
than isolates fed ISS_2 or ISS_3 (p < 0.001). Based on the survival
curves of worms fed ISS_1, ISS_4, OG1RF, MMH594, and V583
there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the pathogenicity proﬁles
for these isolates (p > 0.05).
DISCUSSION
While multiple studies have detected the presence of a wide
range of opportunistic human pathogens onboard the ISS, the
consensus was that additional data was needed to determine
if these microorganisms posed an actual threat to crew health

Urbaniak et al., 2019). Here, we expanded upon previous
genomic analyses in an eﬀort to provide a framework for the
determination of the pathogenic potential of E. faecalis isolates.
For the comparative analyses, the commensal type strain OG1RF
and the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583, were chosen
because of their extensive genotypic (Shankar et al., 2002; Paulsen
et al., 2003; McBride et al., 2007; Bourgogne et al., 2008) and
phenotypic characterization, speciﬁcally in regards to C. elegans
pathogenesis (Garsin et al., 2001; Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). In
addition, the E. faecalis genomes of strains 5952 and JH-1 were
chosen as representative ST strains of the ISS isolates ISS_2 and
ISS_3, and ISS_4, respectively.
While the amount of information that can be gleaned
from a complete genome is large, the current methodologies
(Singh et al., 2018a) are insuﬃcient for the accurate assessment
of pathogenicity for E. faecalis strains. The scores from the
tool, PathogenFinder (Cosentino et al., 2013), predicted each
of the ISS isolates as possessing > 84% probability of being
pathogenic to humans, placing them above known clinical
isolates MMH594 and V583 (Table 1). Another tool related
to scoring pathogenicity, VirFinder, identiﬁed twenty virulence
factors among the ISS strains, but ﬁfteen were present in the
commensal isolate OG1RF as well (Table 3). We cautiously
interpret this to mean that ISS isolates do share some of the
potentially virulence-related properties found in clinical isolates,
but many of these are also shared by prototype commensal
strains of E. faecalis. Further validation for these predictive
algorithms applied to enterococci is needed in order to make
more accurate predictions of which strains could impact human
health. Predictions from PathogenFinder or its equivalent can be
expected to improve if additional training data at the genus or
species level is incorporated.

Enterococcus faecalis on the ISS
FIGURE 3 | Desiccation survival of Enterococcus faecalis strains from the ISS
and the control strains, OG1RF and MMH594. The data are presented as the
average (± SD) of triplicate measurements. Some error bars have been
obscured by the data points.
FIGURE 4 | The average survival of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to ISS
and control strains of Enterococcus faecalis.
Because of the diﬃculty in interpreting potential pathogenicity
of the ISS strains based on genome content alone, we tested them
directly in the C. elegans infection model (Figure 4). Previous
studies identiﬁed parallels in the pathogenicity proﬁles of various
enterococcal lineages when tested in C. elegans (Garsin et al.,
2001) and in mice (Bourgogne et al., 2008). In contrast to
that report (Garsin et al., 2001), we did not detect signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in C. elegans survival when exposed to commensal
OG1RF, or pathogenic V583 and the cytolytic strain MMH594.
E. faecalis proliferate in the intestine of C. elegans (Garsin et al.,
2001) ultimately occluding it (Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). As a
result, C. elegans infected with E. faecalis reach the LT50 33%
faster than worms fed a normal diet of E. coli OP50 (Garsin et al.,
2001). None of the E. faecalis strains tested here, including ISS
strains, exhibited enhanced C. elegans killing (Figure 4). Closely
related strains ISS_2 and 3, despite possessing a high computed
pathogenicity score, were found to be least able to kill C. elegans
(Figure 4).
Additionally, there are currently no validated methods to
predict phenotypic responses of enterococci to environmental
stressors (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased cosmic radiation)
based on their genomic content alone. Because each of the
ISS isolates were recovered from air and surface samples, we
examined them speciﬁcally for the ability to survive desiccation
at RH relevant to the clinical environment (ASHRAE, 2013). In
general, members of the genus Enterococcus are more desiccation
tolerant than closely related microorganisms (Lebreton et al.,
2017). Blaustein et al. (2019) demonstrated that the spaceﬂight
environment onboard the ISS did not select for “extremo-
tolerant” strains of B. cereus and S. aureus. Likewise, we found
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in desiccation tolerance between the
ISS E. faecalis isolates and their representative type strains
(Figure 3). This indicates that their environmental survival in
the ISS was attributable to the previously described intrinsically
rugged nature of E. faecalis (Lebreton et al., 2017). Tirumalai et al.
(2018) compared the genomes of the highly resistant B. safensis
FO-36b and B. pumilus SAFR-032 to over 60 reference strains,
and also failed to ﬁnd genomic signatures for their increased
environmental resistances (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased
ultraviolet radiation). Rather, it is more likely the regulation of a
suite of genes that confers increased resistance as a generalized
stress response. In agreement with Blaustein et al. (2019) we
conclude that the interior space environment (e.g., microgravity,
increased cosmic radiation) selects for intrinsically rugged species
of bacteria, such as E. faecalis, but as of yet, there is no evidence
suggesting selection for enhanced environmental persistence.
In agreement with previous observations (Schiwon et al.,
2013; Sobisch et al., 2019), the E. faecalis isolates examined
here were resistant to multiple antibiotics. While the detection
of multidrug resistant bacteria may sound alarming, much of
that resistance is intrinsic to all enterococci, and other genetic
signatures indicate that these are largely commensal strains
(Table 3). However, resistance to tetracycline displayed by ISS_2,
ISS_3, and ISS_4 was found to be mediated by an acquired
tetW/N/W gene, which confers an MIC equivalent to that of
clinical isolates (Table 4). In addition to harboring genes that
make combating infections diﬃcult, E. faecalis strains possess the
ability to spread antibiotic resistance to genes to other bacterial
species, including the commonly isolated ISS inhabitant S. aureus
(Sobisch et al., 2019). Although there have been no reports of
VRE isolated from onboard the ISS at the time of this publication,
it is important to note that both vancomycin resistance genes
and E. faecalis genomic signatures were detected concurrently
from the surface of the dining table during expedition 43 (Singh
et al., 2018b). During the same mission, E. faecalis was also
ranked the second most abundant BSL-2 microorganism in
the metagenomic analysis of the entire campaign (Singh et al.,
2018b). In fact, Mora et al. (2019) determined Enterococcus to
be one of the ten indicator genera that distinguished the ISS
microbiome from the human and indoor samples of the Home
Microbiome Project (Mora et al., 2019).
There were several limitations to the data presented above.
The desiccation survival experiments were terminated before
any signiﬁcant decrease in viability was observed. Extending the
experiment until no surviving cells remained may have revealed
a diﬀerence in the survival curves among the strains and provide
insight to the length of time E. faecalis can remain viable. The lack
of experimentally validated computational tools for E. faecalis
led to conﬂicting results when comparing the genomes known
clinical isolates to commensal strains. In addition, C. elegans
serves as a rudimentary model system for human infection.

Enterococcus faecalis on the ISS
However, the challenges presented here provide the foundation
for future investigations of E. faecalis, on Earth or in space.
As members of the core gut microbiome, E. faecalis will
continue to be transported to the ISS and the ability to
detect pathogenic strains will be beneﬁcial for crew health.
Unlike most environmental bacteria (Staley and Konopka,
1985), E. faecalis strains are routinely recovered on culture
media. Based on the antibiotic resistance proﬁles presented
here, incorporating the above high-level aminoglycosides to the
routine onboard culturing activities could serve as the ﬁrst step
toward distinguishing pathogenic from commensal strains of
E. faecalis. Because of their commonness as survivors on abiotic
surfaces, their potential ability to infect, as well as the ability
of E. faecalis to readily acquire and spread mobile elements
conferring antibiotic resistance, continued microbial monitoring
and pathogen identiﬁcation will be important.
Current microbial monitoring of ISS air and surface sampling
occurs once a month for the ﬁrst 90 days of a mission, and
decreases to one sample event for every 90 days thereafter (ISS-
MORD, 2013). Because these microbial monitoring procedures
are culture based, there is an inherent bias toward the small
fraction of bacterial species that will form a colony on a plate
(Staley and Konopka, 1985). Assessing the total microbial burden,
and viable fraction, by combining genomic and culture-based
analyses provides a more accurate representation of the ISS
microbiome (Be et al., 2017; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaﬀet al., 2019).
However, it is still unclear which, if any, of these microorganisms
are relevant to crew health (Schiwon et al., 2013; Be et al., 2017;
Lang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018a,b; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaﬀ
et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019).
The
need
for
expedient
identiﬁcation
of
pathogenic
microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance proﬁles is
not a challenge unique to the spaceﬂight environment. Recent
advances in rapid diagnostics have helped alleviate the clinical
reliance on culture based techniques to identify infectious agents,
yet these resources are not always widely available (Maurer et al.,
2017). Fortunately, this is not the case for the ISS where the
crew have access to Wetlab-2 Cepheid© SmartCycyler that can
be used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of air, surface,
water, and clinical samples3. Although it is currently conﬁgured
to detect only a limited number of microbial pathogens, the
RAZORTM EX BioDetection System (Idaho Technology Inc.)
is currently being developed for in-ﬂight microbial monitoring
and could be modiﬁed for a wider range of microbial targets.
Another promising technology for pathogen detection is the
ONT MinION sequencing device employed above. Castro-
Wallace et al. (2017) have previously validated its eﬃcacy in the
spacecraft environment. The MinION is currently capable of
identifying bacterial species in near real time from metagenomic
data (Sanderson et al., 2018) or isolated samples (Gargis et al.,
2019) and has been used for the ﬁrst ever oﬀ-Earth identiﬁcation
of bacteria cultured and sequenced in ﬂight (Burton et al., 2020).
Due to the inability for the existing tools to distinguish
pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis, we make the
following recommendations: Rather than continuing to wait
3https://www.nasa.gov/spacebio/microbiology/hardware
for sample return and analysis using the current unvalidated
databases, we suggest performing an initial screen for HLGR.
Then, any isolates exhibiting HLGR should be sequenced using
the MinION and evaluated for the presence of the type 2
capsule (McBride et al., 2007), the vancomycin resistance operon
observed in V583 (Paulsen et al., 2003), components of the
pathogenicity island (e.g., cytolysin production loci and the
enterococcal surface protein, Esp), and the absence of functional
CRISPR-Cas arrays (Van Tyne et al., 2019). This information
would then provide near real-time information for the crew
regarding the need for additional decontamination procedures.
These advancements would not be limited to E. faecalis isolates,
however more accurate genomic targets for additional pathogen
detection will need to be experimentally validated (Chiu and
Miller, 2019). With the development of such targets, multiple
pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) can quickly be
identiﬁed within a single sample (Miller et al., 2019).
