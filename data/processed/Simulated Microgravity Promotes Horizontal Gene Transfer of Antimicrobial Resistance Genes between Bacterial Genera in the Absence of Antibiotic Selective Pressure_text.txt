Abstract: Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many
mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the
leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and
could pose a signiﬁcant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space
missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety
level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth
with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter
pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes)
using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that were co-cultured with A. pittii under
SMG had a signiﬁcantly higher number of isolates that were now blaOXA-500- and ISAba1-positive
compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic
change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible
to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the ﬁrst time, increased HGT activity under SMG and
the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased gene dissemination within
bacterial communities.

1. Introduction
Bacteria are able to adapt to a wide variety of conditions, as evidenced by their survival
and growth in extreme environments, such as the arid Atacama desert [1], hypersaline salt
mines and lakes [2,3], acidic rocks in the Yellowstone geothermal environment [4], and
the multi-stressor environment of Antarctica [5]. Bacterial communities have also been
found beyond the Earth’s surface on the International Space Station (ISS), a low-gravity,
high-radiation, hermetically sealed built environment [6]. The microbial communities
characterized here consist of environmental organisms, human-associated commensal
bacteria and biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) microbes, resistant to various antibiotics, and carrying
numerous anti-microbial resistance genes [7–9]. This resistance could potentially pose
a serious threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions, as
medical attention would not be readily available.
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the movement of genetic material (i.e., DNA) be-
tween microorganisms through either transformation, conjugation or transduction, and is
considered to be central to microbial evolution [10,11]. In dynamic mixed communities,

either human or environmental, HGT between species may confer an overall ﬁtness ad-
vantage to the community, as the acquisition of new traits in individual cells within that
community allows them to better adapt to changing conditions [12–15]. In other cases,
HGT may have an unfavorable effect if it leads to an excessive accumulation of genes, or
a neutral one [16], if there is no impact on the ﬁtness of the organism [16].
In a recent study comparing bacteria from two extreme built environments, one on
Earth (Concordia Research Station in Antarctica) and one in space (International Space
Station), a comparison between isolates of the same species showed that those from the
International Space Station (ISS) had more mobile genetic elements within their genomes
than those from Concordia [17]. In a follow-up analysis conducted by our group using the
ISS resistome and microbiome data presented by Urbaniak et al. 2018 [7], we performed
a series of correlation analyses to determine which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes
were associated with which species. Interestingly, no statistically signiﬁcant correlations
were found. These data, coupled by the Concordia/ISS study, led us to hypothesize that the
stressors of the ISS, speciﬁcally microgravity, promote enhanced HGT between organisms,
compared to what would be observed on Earth.
To address this hypothesis, co-cultures between donor and recipient strains were
grown under simulated microgravity (SMG) (which we used as a proxy for µgravity
conditions on the ISS) and normal gravity (1G), using the high-aspect-ratio vessel (HARV),
with gene transfer tracked using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The donor and recipient
strains were Acinetobacter pittii (strain IIF1SW-P1) and Staphylococcus aureus (strains IF4SW,
IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW), respectively. All strains were previously isolated from various
locations on the ISS as part of the Microbial-1 Tracking study [8]. A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 was
chosen as the donor, since it was previously shown by our group to be resistant to oxacillin
and contained the chromosomally located blaOXA-500 gene within its genome [7], a beta-
lactamase which alone can confer resistance to oxacillin [18]. The four S. aureus strains,
IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW, were chosen as recipients because they were susceptible to
oxacillin and harbored neither the blaOXA-500 gene nor any other beta-lactamase genes [7].
The donor, A. pittii, harbored ISAba1, a transposable element that can jump between
segments of the genome and, in some cases, can act as a promoter region for blaOXA genes,
allowing for increased resistance to oxacillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics [19,20].
ISAba1 was not found in either of the recipient S. aureus strains. HGT ability was, therefore,
tracked between A. pittii and S. aureus using the AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1.
2. Methods
2.1. Co-Culture Experiments
All strains examined in this study were cultivated from the ISS environment collected
during Flight 2 (May 2015) as per the published protocol [8]. A. pittii strain, IIF1SW-
P1, was isolated at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small
module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities,
spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. S. aureus strain IF4SW was isolated
from Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the
table was for dining, crew members also used the table for experimental work. S. aureus
strain IIF6SW was cultured from the sample collected at Location #6, a stowage rack where
experimental materials were stored for long duration. S. aureus strain IF7SW was isolated
from Location #7, an overhead three-panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack
1, which is used for basic material research in the microgravity environment of the ISS.
S. aureus strain IIF8SW was retrieved from the samples at Location #8, an exterior aft wall
of crew quarters. The crew quarters are a permanent personal space for crewmembers to
sleep and perform personal recreation and communication, as well as provide on-orbit
stowage of personal belongings.
Donor (A. pittii strain IIF1SW-P1) and recipient (S. aureus strains IF4SW-P1, IIF6SW-P1,
IF7SW-P3, IIF8SW-P1) bacteria were streaked from −80 ◦C freezer stocks onto tryptic soy
agar plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) and incubated overnight (~16 h)

Life 2021, 11, 960
3 of 9
at 37 ◦C. A single colony from each plate was added to 10 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB)
in a 50 mL Falcon tube for S. aureus, and 8 mL of TSB in a snap cap tube for A. pittii and
grown overnight (~20 h) in a shaking incubator at 85 rpm. A low speed was chosen, so as
to not dislodge pili or ﬂagella that could be used for HGT, but high enough that the bacteria
did not settle out of culture over time. The overnight culture was centrifuged for 10 min at
3000× g, the supernatant decanted, and the pellet washed in 1× sterile phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Pellets were then resuspended in 10 mL of 1× PBS. For S. aureus, 1 mL was
then transferred to 9 mL of PBS and, for A. pittii, the tube was topped with 3 mL of PBS.
The biomass of the cultures was measured with DENSICHEK® (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile,
France) and adjusted with PBS to reach a concentration of 108 cfu/mL, which was then
serially diluted to 106 cfu/mL. 100 µL of one S. aureus recipient strain was added to 10 mL
of TSB and 100 µL of the donor A. pittii was added to the same 10 mL tube to set up the
co-cultures. After gentle mixing, the complete 10 mL volume containing the donor and
recipient was carefully added to HARVs to avoid any bubbles. HARVs were grown under
SMG (vertical position) and 1G (horizontal position) at 33 rpm for 20 h at 37 ◦C.
2.2. Isolation of Colonies after HARV Growth
After incubation, the liquid from each HARV vessel was collected and 100 µL, in dupli-
cate, was plated on MSA (selective for S. aureus) (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA), MSA+ 4 µg/mL
oxacillin sodium salt monohydrate (VWR, USA) (selective for S. aureus that had become
resistant to oxacillin) and Leeds agar (selective for A. pittii) (VWR, USA). MSA and Leeds
plates were incubated overnight at 37 ◦C and MSA+ oxacillin plates were incubated for
72 h at 37 ◦C. Colonies on MSA, MSA+ oxacillin, and Leeds plates were counted, and
cfu/mL was calculated. Colonies that grew on MSA+ oxacillin plates were picked and
placed in 250 µL 1× PBS and stored at 4 ◦C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted
using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep Kit (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA, USA) following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.3. Designing Primers
Primers were designed using the A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 draft genome that we had previ-
ously published, in which blaOXA-500 gene resides on scaffold 5 and ISAba1 gene on both
scaffolds 44 and 70 [21]. Primers were designed using IDT DNA PrimerQuest for genes of
interest. IDT DNA OligoAnalyzer was used to ensure no hairpins and correct PCR melting
temperature. NCBI BLAST was used to ensure no off-target binding sites for strains used in
this study. Ampliﬁcation product of the primers for blaOXA-500 and the location within the
genome is shown in Figure S3A and for ISAba1, in Figure S3B in Supplementary Materials.
The product size of blaOXA-500 is 591 bp and for ISAba1, is 390 bp.
2.4. PCR
Each 25-µL reaction consisted of 12.5 µL of GoTaq® Green Master Mix (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), 1 µL each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (10 µM
each), 5.5 µL of nuclease free water (Promega, USA) and 5 µL of template DNA. The
following primer pairs were used:
•
blaOXA-500_F (5′-CCGAGTTGTTCCAATCCCTTAT-3′) and
•
blaOXA-500_R (5′-ATATGTTCCCGCCTCTACCT-3′) to amplify blaOXA-500
•
and ISAba1_F (5′-ATGCAGCGCTTCTTTGCAGG-3′) and
•
ISAba1_R (5′-AATGATTGGTGACAATGAAG-3′) to amplify ISAba1.
The reaction conditions were as follows: 95 ◦C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 ◦C for 30 s,
55 ◦C for 30 s, 72 ◦C for 1 min and then a ﬁnal extension of 72 ◦C for 5 min. Ampliﬁed PCR
products were run on the E-Gel™Power Snap Electrophoresis System (Thermo Fischer,
Waltham, MA, USA, cat # G8300) using their pre-cast 1.2% SYBR Safe, E-gels (cat # G521801).
Gels were run with a 1 Kb plus DNA ladder (cat # 10488090). Gel images were captured
with the built-in camera. The positive control consisted of DNA isolated from the parental
A. pittii strain and the negative controls were DNA isolated from the parental S. aureus

Life 2021, 11, 960
4 of 9
strains. A no-template control (NTC) consisting of molecular-grade water instead of DNA
was used.
For PCR reactions that were negative, a follow-up PCR was performed using the 16S
rRNA gene to conﬁrm that the DNA extraction procedure produced sufﬁcient DNA. The
following primers were used for 16S rRNA gene ampliﬁcation: the forward primer, 27F
(5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC
CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 ◦C
for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 ◦C for 50 s, annealing at
55 ◦C for 50 s, and extension at 72 ◦C for 1 min 30 s and ﬁnalized by extension at 72 ◦C for
10 min. PCR with the 16S rRNA gene showed that all our samples did indeed have the
DNA product and that extraction was successful.
2.5. Calculating the Efﬁciency of Gene Transfer
The number of colonies that had grown on MSA+ oxacillin and were positive for at
least one gene (blaOXA-500 or ISAba1) was divided by 0.1 mL (the volume of the HARV
culture used for plating). This number represents the theoretical concentration (cfu/mL) of
cells in the culture that have acquired one of the genes. This number was then divided by
the total concentration of S. aureus cells (cfu/mL) in the culture, which was calculated from
the number of colonies that grew on MSA.
2.6. Chromosome vs. Plasmid Location of blaOXA-500
Others have documented in the literature that blaOXA-500 is located on the chromosome
and is not a plasmid. To conﬁrm that the same was true for our donor strain, A. pittii
IIF1SW-P1, the following analyses were performed. plasmidSPAdes was used to assemble
plasmid sequences from the whole genome-sequencing data of our strain. A simple
blastn comparison between the blaOXA-500 sequence and the plasmid sequences showed
the absence of the gene from the plasmid-assembled contigs. Furthermore, oriTﬁnder
was used to determine whether scaffold_5 (length = 172 kb), on which blaOXA-500 was
found, as well as the assembled sequences not characterized as plasmid sequences (from
the plasmidSPAdes output above), contained evidence of plasmid markers, such as an
origin of transfer site (oriT) and relaxases. None of these plasmid markers were detected
on scaffold_5 and the “chromosomal” sequences.
3. Results
In order to determine whether HGT occurred between donor and recipient, suitable
PCR primers were designed to amplify regions of the blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 genes from
A. pittii IIF1SW-P1. The sequences of the two genes, used to design the primers, were
extracted from the draft whole-genome sequence of A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 [21]. PCR analysis
performed on DNA isolated from A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 using the designed blaOXA-500 and
ISAba1 primers showed strong bands on an agarose gel, while PCR analysis performed on
DNA isolated from the four S. aureus strains showed no amplicons.
To compare HGT potential between SMG and 1G, co-cultures of A. pittii (donor strain)
and S. aureus (recipient strain) were grown in the HARV under SMG (vertical rotation) or
1G (horizontal rotation) for 20 h, after which the culture was plated on mannitol salt agar
(MSA) to select for S. aureus. The MSA was also supplemented with oxacillin to select only
those S. aureus colonies that had acquired resistance to the antibiotic. To verify that this
newly acquired resistance to oxacillin was not due to spontaneous mutations but rather
through the HGT of blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 from A. pittii, the S. aureus colonies that grew
on MSA supplemented with oxacillin were picked for PCR analysis. A schematic of the
experimental set-up is shown in Figure 1.

resentative gel images are shown in Figure S1. On average, 77% of the S. aureus colonies
that were grown with A. pittii under SMG and had acquired resistance to oxacillin now
harbored both blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 (89% of the colonies had acquired at least one). This
is in contrast with 1G, where only 1% of S. aureus colonies that had acquired oxacillin
resistance were positive for both blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 (8% of the colonies had acquired at
least one).

Figure 2. Comparison of HGT activity between SMG and 1G. Four strains of S. aureus (IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW) were
used as the recipient and were co-cultured (separately) with the donor strain A. pittii for 20 h at 37 ◦C under SMG or 1G
conditions. Cultures were plated on MSA containing 4 µg/mL of oxacillin. Colonies that grew were picked, subjected to
DNA extraction and then analyzed by PCR with primers speciﬁc to blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 from the donor strain. The graphs
show the percent of S. aureus colonies, from each strain, that grew on MSA+ oxacillin that had acquired (A) blaOXA-500,
(B) ISAba1 or (C) both genes from the donor A. pittii.
The differences in proportions observed between SMG and 1G were not due to differ-
ences in growth at these different conditions, as each strain showed the same biomass after
20 h, whether grown under SMG or 1G (Figure S2).
The efﬁciency of transfer under SMG for all four strains was, on average, 3.06 × 10−7
while, for 1G, it was 3.21 × 10−9 (Table 1). While all strains had similar efﬁciencies, IIF8SW
had the highest and IIF6SW the lowest.

To determine how stable these donor genes were in the recipient, two resistant S. aureus
1F4SW colonies that had acquired both genes were sub-cultured on MSA + oxacillin
plates, a total of four times. Even after the 4th sub-culture, the colonies were still resis-
tant to oxacillin, and PCR conﬁrmed that blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 were still present within
the genome.
4. Discussion
We have shown that HGT is increased under SMG compared to 1G. The transfer of
AMR genes, which were tracked by PCR, occurred in the absence of selective pressure by
antibiotics. This transfer led to functional changes, as the acquisition of the two AMR genes,

Life 2021, 11, 960
7 of 9
blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, that were tracked in the four strains of S. aureus, made them resistant
to oxacillin, to which they were previously susceptible. These results have signiﬁcant
implications for long-duration space missions because pathogens that are susceptible to
antibiotics could become resistant and thus harder to treat. In addition, even if astronauts
are screened for problematic microbes prior to ﬂight, issues could still arise, as commensals
are known to act as reservoirs for AMR genes that can be disseminated to (opportunistic)
pathogens [22–24]. For example, a study conducted in a hospital in the Netherlands showed
that mecA gene transfer occurred in a patient between mecA+ S. epidermidis and a mecA−
strain of S. aureus [25].
It was beyond the scope of the study to determine the cause of the increased HGT that
was observed, but one mechanism could be increased competence, allowing for transfor-
mation to occur, one of three modes of gene transfer. Competence allows bacterial cells to
uptake DNA from its environment and increase the response to different stressors [26–29].
In this case, naked DNA released from dead A. pittii cells could have been readily taken up
by S. aureus when exposed to SMG due to an increase in its competence. While S. aureus
is not classically considered to be naturally competent, as Streptococcus pneumoniae and
Bacillus subtilis are, it does harbor genes that are involved in competence and thought
to promote natural competence under the right conditions [30,31]. The conditions that
S. aureus needs are not yet known, but, similar to other bacteria, it could be an adverse
environment. Indeed, when S. aureus cells were subjected to heat-shock, cold-shock and the
stringent response, there was increased expression of competence gene orthologs compared
to the non-stressed conditions [32]. In S. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, competence confers
a survival advantage when cells are subjected to stress [33,34], so there is a possibility that
growth under SMG led to an adverse environment for S. aureus, causing cells to become
more competent to increase survival. Conjugation is a less likely scenario since, consistent
with what others have documented in the literature, blaOXA-500 is located on the chromo-
some and not a plasmid. A second mechanism could be increased transduction caused by
growth under SMG. Transduction is the transfer of genetic material via bacterial phages. It
is well known that prophage activity is increased during stress, leading to increased phage
production, helping the host survive these adverse conditions [35,36].
5. Conclusions
This paper describes, for the ﬁrst time, the effects of SMG on HGT and has shown that
it is increased in SMG compared to 1G. If the same trend is observed on the ISS, this will
have a signiﬁcant impact on how we view bacterial interactions in space and its effects on
astronaut health. The next steps would be to elucidate the mechanisms behind the HGT, to
develop appropriate countermeasures for long-duration space missions.
