Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint
rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceﬂight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle
atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceﬂight
experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce
hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was
conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned
as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e)
2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean
myotube diameter increased signiﬁcantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic
markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inﬂammatory, catabolic
markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were signiﬁcantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of
phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was signiﬁcantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic
signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceﬂight research bioreactor, using uniaxial
cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of
stretch.

INTRODUCTION
Mitigating the adverse effects of spaceﬂight requires a better
mechanistic understanding of the profound challenges that are
imposed upon astronauts, including the upcoming missions to
Mars and the moon. Extended spaceﬂight missions that travel
beyond the cocoon of the Earth’s magnetosphere subject
astronauts to microgravity and outer space radiation. Risks
inherent to the mechanical unloading of microgravity include
degeneration of musculoskeletal tissue and the cardiovascular
system. The microgravity of spaceﬂight indeed causes substantial
wasting of skeletal muscle and weakness1–4. Mounting evidence
indicates that altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and
impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading-
induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue4–8.
Therefore, the identiﬁcation of mechanosensing pathways during
the unloading of spaceﬂight, and thus the effect on musculoske-
letal morphology and contractile function, continues as one of
NASA’s long-term mission objectives.
Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that drive body move-
ment, protect joints and bones, serve as the primary glucose sink,
and are central to systemic energy metabolism. Skeletal muscles
adapt readily to changes in various stimuli, including changes in
loading9,10. Indeed, skeletal muscles remodel their morphology in
response to changes in the mechanical, nutrient, and energy-
sensing environments11–15. Load-bearing skeletal muscles adapt
to changes in the mechanical environment, allowing mature
muscle ﬁbers to hypertrophy in response to increased loading and
atrophy when presented with decreased loading. For example,
when humans participate in resistance exercise, skeletal muscles
can undergo increased mass through hypertrophy of muscle
ﬁbers16,17. In response to mechanical unloading that occurs during
the microgravity of spaceﬂight, chronic bedrest, or casting,
skeletal muscles adapt rapidly by degrading contractile protein
into constitutive amino acids, suppressing protein synthesis, and
thus reducing muscle ﬁber cross-sectional area4,6. A common
teleological argument for skeletal muscle atrophy as a biological
response to unloading is that extreme disuse would accompany a
signiﬁcant injury or disease, both of which require an increased
demand for amino acids and protein18–20. However, the skeletal
muscle wasting or atrophy that occurs with microgravity21,
disuse22, cancer23, and aging24 compromises physical function
and systemic health.
Rotating wall vessel bioreactors are frequently utilized in tissue
engineering and cell culture research to simulate spaceﬂight
microgravity conditions25–27. These bioreactors produce a low-
shear, three-dimensional culture environment that mimics certain
aspects of weightlessness27. However, they are not suitable for
inducing tensile mechanical loading in skeletal muscle ﬁbers
experience during exercise in spaceﬂight. Although tumbler
bioreactors create a low-shear environment through rotation,
they largely produce compression rather than tension on skeletal
muscle ﬁbers. Therefore, tumbler or centrifugal fail to accurately
reproduce the changes in tensile mechanical forces encountered
by skeletal muscles during weightlessness and exercise.

Skeletal muscles produce and transfer tensile loads to attached
tendons and bones by two mechanisms: (1) in series through
muscle ﬁbers and (2) in parallel through transverse loading of
z-discs and linked costamere interaction with surrounding layers
of connective tissue (e.g., endomysium, perimysium)28. Skeletal
muscles are organized as multinucleated myoﬁbers, whose
function is to generate length and velocity-dependent forces for
movement and stability. Skeletal muscle contractions and outside
resistance produce net tension down a skeletal muscle’s long axis.
Indeed, skeletal muscles respond to dyanamic alterations in
mechanical loading by adapting muscle mass, ﬁber cross-sectional
area29,30, and shifting the % of slow-twitch ﬁbers31,32. Unloading
induced skeletal muscle atrophy is believed to be a function of
both elevated protein degradation coupled with decreased
protein anabolism8. In addition, there is an increase in connective
tissue in unloaded skeletal muscle as well33. Thus, maintaining
mechanical loading, such as tension and stretch, is crucial for
muscle health and function. Therefore, the development of a
bioreactor for experimental use of skeletal muscle cells (i.e.,
myotubes) to simulate spaceﬂight or exercise during spaceﬂight
should impose similar uniaxial tensile loading or stretch, that
cannot be currently reproduced with rotating wall vessels
bioreactors.
Ergo, to study the physiological responses of skeletal muscle
ﬁbers to tensile loading, myoblasts were seeded and differentiated
into myotubes on an laminin-coated elastic membrane, which was
then stretched to observe the cellular responses34. Based upon
our ﬁndings we propose a microgravity bioreactor for the cellular
stretch that is an analog of the FlexCell® system, which uses a
vacuum instead to stretch the silastic membrane, eliciting radial
loading35. Instead, we employed a StrexCell® system ﬁtted that
includes a stepper motor to produce true uniaxial, cyclic stretch
while eliciting tensile loading on myoblasts or myotubes. There-
fore, the purpose of this study is to use cyclic stretch and cessation
protocols with the StrexCell system on skeletal muscle myo-
tubes36,37 as a potential bioreactor for microgravity and re-entry
into gravitational environments.
RESULTS
Myotube morphology in response to cyclic stretch, cessation
of daily stretch
To study the effects of cyclic stretch and cessation of stretch on
skeletal muscle myotube morphology and size, we used C2C12
mouse lineage myoblasts to generate myotubes, and mounted on
laminin. β-sarcoglycan immunoﬂuorescence positive staining was
used as a membrane marker to calculate the myotube diameter as
a marker of hypertrophy and atrophy (Fig. 1). Confocal immuno-
ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcation revealed a signiﬁcant increase of 51%
and 94% in mean myotube diameter following 2 and 5 days of a
cyclic stretch, compared to the 2-day and 5-day quiescent
controls, respectively (Fig. 1b). When myotubes underwent three
days without cyclic stretch in myotubes, following 2 days of cyclic
stretch, then myotube diameter was 32% lower compared to the
loaded, stretched myotubes (Fig. 1b). Quantiﬁcation of the total
nuclei population per ﬁeld revealed a signiﬁcant reduction as a
result of 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching compared to the controls
(Fig. 1c), indicating an increase in ﬁber size while the nuclear
number was relatively static. The fusion index was found to be
increased signiﬁcantly by the 2, and 5 days stretching protocol
compared with quiescent controls (Fig. 1d). However, three days
of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT), did not alter the
fusion index compared to the 2 days cyclic stretching.
Functional protein turnover marker with cyclic stretching and
cessation of stretch
We then determined the effects of (1) uniaxial cyclic stretching
and (2) release from or cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch on
markers of protein synthesis and proteolysis commonly used in
muscle atrophy and hypertrophy studies35,38,39. Protein abun-
dance of the focal adhesion complex and cytoskeletal protein talin
was chosen as a muscle hypertrophy marker, while the activity of
calpains was chosen as a proteolytic marker (Fig. 2). Our ﬁndings
revealed that both 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching signiﬁcantly
elevated the levels of talin protein compared to the control levels
(Fig. 2a). There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between 2
and 5 days of stretch on talin protein levels.
However, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch
(3dAT) resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower level of talin than 2 and 5
days of daily cyclic stretch. Talin protein levels were not
statistically different from quiescent myotubes that experienced
no daily stress and strain due to stretch.
In contrast, calpain activity that was measured by ﬂuorescence
revealed a signiﬁcant increase in activity in the 2dHY and 5dHY
groups, indicating that daily bouts of cyclic stretch elevated
calpain levels and presumably remodeling (Fig. 2b). Myotubes that
completed stretch cessation myotubes displayed calpain levels
that were not statistically different than the no-stretch and 2dHY
groups. Calpain activity was signiﬁcantly lower in the 3dAT group
vs. 5dHY myotubes.
Akt and Foxo3a signaling is altered by cyclic stretch and
removal of cyclic stretch
The Akt activation pathway has been involved in regulating
muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. To reveal the effects of daily
cyclic stretch and subsequent cessation of daily bouts of cyclic
stretch, we measured total Akt, phosphorylated Akt at Thr308,
total protein levels for FoxO3a, phosphorylated FoxO3a, and the p-
FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio (Fig. 3). Our data revealed that
phosphorylated Akt levels were elevated after daily bouts of
cyclic stretch (Fig. 4b). The phosphorylated Akt to total Akt activity
ratio trended upwards with 2 days of a daily cyclic stretch but was
not different from than controls (Fig. 3c). Akt phosphorylation
levels were signiﬁcantly lower in 3dAT than in 2dHY but were no
different than controls (Fig. 3b). pAkt/total Akt for 3dAT was
similar to the no stretch control group.
The FoxO3a transcription factor can be phosphorylated and
inactivated by Akt phosphorylation or conversely dephosphory-
lated and stimulated by pro-inﬂammatory signaling. Total protein
levels for FoxO3a were elevated by almost 3-fold after cessation of
daily cyclic stretch compared with the no stretch, 2dHY and 5dHY
groups (Fig. 3d). However, the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a levels were
signiﬁcantly lower in the 3dAT group than in controls and trended
lower than in the myotubes subjected to daily bouts of cyclic
strain (Fig. 3f). The data suggest that FoxO3a levels are elevated,
and the proportion of dephosphorylated FoxO3a and thus
activated FoxO3a is upregulated with when daily bouts of cyclic
stretch are removed.
Catabolic, inﬂammatory signaling in response to daily cyclic
stretch and cessation of stretch
In order to understand whether the cessation of cyclic strain and
subsequent atrophy was linked with catabolic, inﬂammatory
signaling, we interrogated three canonical inﬂammatory proteins
that contribute to skeletal muscle ﬁber atrophy during unloading.
For this purpose, we measured myotube levels of the inﬂamma-
tory cytokines interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well
as

statistical difference in IL-1ß, IL-6, and p65 among myotubes
subjected to no stretch, 2 days of cyclic stretch, and 5 days of
cyclic stretch (Fig. 4). However, there was a 2–3 fold increase in IL-
1ß, IL-6, and p65 compared with 2dHY, 5dHY, and the no stretch
controls, similar to the pattern observed in total FoxO3a levels.
These data suggest a signiﬁcant role of key pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines and NF-kappaB in myotube atrophy following the
removal of daily bouts of cyclic stretch.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we examined the efﬁcacy of the application
and withdrawal of uniaxial cyclic stretch on myotubes as a
prospective bioreactor for use in spaceﬂight research. The uniaxial
cyclic stretch produced tensile loading on myotubes with some
shear in anchoring interface with laminin on the dish or
membrane. Withdrawal from cyclic stretch elicits an ‘off-transient’
period that our data suggest mimics unloading-microgravity. The
cyclic stretch protocol (12% sinusoidal stretch, 0.7 Hz waveform
frequency, 1 hour/day) over 2 and 5 days produced marked
hypertrophy of skeletal muscle myotubes, accompanied by
elevated anabolic markers (talin, Akt phosphorylation at Thr308).
In contrast, withdrawal and cessation of cyclic stretch resulted in
substantial atrophy on myotube diameter, concomitant with
reduced Akt phosphorylation, and elevation of catabolic, pro-
inﬂammatory markers (e.g., IL-1ß, IL-6, NF-kappaB subunit p65) as
well as proteolytic signaling (e.g., reduced FoxO3a phosphoryla-
tion/total FoxO3a ratio, elevated total FoxO3a). A discussion of the
physiological and technological development relevance follows.
These ﬁndings have a number of parallels with the data
published by Soltow, et al. (2013)35 using the FlexCell® as a model
for overloading and unloading (e.g., microgravity). The FlexCell®’s

2 days cyclic stretching
protocol
(12%, 0.7 Hz,1 h/d)
using
collagen-coated plates increased myotube diameter, talin levels,
Akt phosphorylation activity, and FoxO3a phosphorylation leading
to stretch-induced muscle hypertrophy and growth. In contrast,
48 h after the removal of bouts of cyclic stretch resulted in
decreased anabolic signaling, increased FoxO3a dephosphoryla-
tion, thus activating pro-inﬂammatory and muscle atrophic
signaling and causing smaller myotube diameter. These data
suggest that uniaxial stretch and cessation of stretch can be
validly used to test myotube responses to both increased and
decreased mechanical loading.
In contrast, rotating wall vessels bioreactors are commonly used
in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate
microgravity
conditions.
These
bioreactors
create
a
three-
dimensional culture environment with low shear forces, mimick-
ing some aspects of weightlessness. However, they are not
effective in inducing the primary consequence of weightlessness
on skeletal muscles, which is a dramatically reduced tensile load.
Furthermore, centrifugation adds compressive stress to alleviate
microgravity, a far different loading proﬁle that skeletal muscles
and attached tendons experience (e.g., tension along the long
axis) in a terrestrial environment.
Increased tensile stress and strain in skeletal muscle ﬁbers
promote muscle growth by elevating protein synthesis and
altering protein degradation, thus initiating muscle hypertro-
phy40–42. Recent reports also characterized an increase in myotube
diameter
ex
vivo
in
response
to
mechanical
stretch
and
stimulation35,43,44. In our StrexCell application, the uniaxial cyclic
stretching protocol for 2 days and 5 days produced tensile loading
on myotubes, which resulted in muscle ﬁber hypertrophy. Thus,
loading of tensile force stimulated an increased myotube diameter
and size, conﬁrming that cyclic stretch in myotubes elicits
hypertrophy of the muscle ﬁbers (Fig. 1). Overloading produced
by cyclic stretch induced muscle hypertrophy that was directly
linked to increased markers of anabolism and hypertrophy,
including upregulation of talin and increased Akt phosphorylation
at Thr308. Akt activation is a causal regulator in protein synthesis
signaling in skeletal muscle45,46. For example, the overexpression
of active Akt levels previously elicited skeletal muscle myotube
hypertrophy47. Furthermore, we found that bouts cyclic stretch
activated Akt through phosphorylation at Thr308, which was
linked to an elevated phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio
which could suppress catabolism. Consistently, we previously
demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme mimetic EUK-134
relieved unloading induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation
(deactivation)
and
decrease
in

phosphorylation
(activation)5.
Withdrawal and cessation of the cyclic stretching protocol affect

alterations. Using the StrexCell system to release from daily cyclic
stretch, C2C12 myotubes underwent a signiﬁcant reduction in
myotube size after 3 days cessation of cyclic stretch (Fig. 1). A
rapid reduction in skeletal muscle size mimics the muscle disuse
atrophy that occurs with mechanical unloading4,6,35. Indeed,
mechanical unloading and spaceﬂight lead to both a suppression
of anabolic signaling and an elevation of proteolytic pathways,
thus leading to muscle ﬁber atrophy1,12. FoxO3a is an atrophy-
associated transcription factor that is translocated to the nucleus
in its active form during skeletal muscle unloading. Indeed,
nuclear accumulation of active FoxO3a is the atrophy-associated
transcription factor FoxO3a is linked to muscle atrophy48,49. In our
StrexCell protocol, withdrawal of daily cyclic stretching led to
increased
levels
of
unphosphorylated
(i.e.,
active)
FoxO3a,
consistent with protein degradation’s role in muscle atrophy
(Fig. 3). The total amount of FoxO3a was nearly tripled, also
suggesting potential stimulation of catabolic signaling. There was

a smaller 40% increase in phosphorylated Foxo3a. thus was a
statistically signiﬁcant decrease (more than 50%) in the p-FoxO3a/
total FoxO3a ratio, consistent with greater potential for rapid
protein degradation and myotube ﬁber atrophy. Notably, space-
ﬂight microgravity lowered the Akt activity pathway by down-
regulating the eIF4/p70S6K signaling50. Furthermore, Bodine and
Baehr (2014)51 reported that the FoxO3a transcription factor
regulates the MuRF1 and MAFbx expression involved in the
protein degradation process leading to muscle atrophy52.
Akt activation is a well-known causal regulator of protein
synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle45,46. Downregulation of the
Akt activation pathway, which is associated with dephosphoryla-
tion of Akt and 4E-BP1, has been consistently reported in muscle
atrophy53–55. Our laboratory previously reported downregulation
of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation in response the mechanical
unloading, prevented by EUK-134 an antioxidant mimetic of
superoxide dismutase and catalase8. In this study, Akt phosphor-
ylation was signiﬁcantly decreased when daily cyclic stretch was
withdrawn for three days. This observation would be consistent
with reduced protein synthesis and thus muscle atrophy.
Simultaneous activation of FoxO3a and suppression of an Akt-
mTOR pathways with skeletal muscle wasting, including mechan-
ical unloading has been a frequent observation12,40,46,56–58.
Indeed, historical and recent studies have consistently documen-
ted increased proteolysis59 coupled with decreased skeletal
muscle protein synthesis in response to hindlimb unloading of
hindlimb muscles13,60. Furthermore, we previously documented
greater dephosphorylation of FoxO3a, accompanied by down-
regulation of an Akt-mTOR pathway with unloading-induced
skeletal muscle atrophy8. This is consistent with the argument that
dephosphorylation of Akt can activate FoxO3a and thus enhance
proteolysis during unloading-induced atrophy8,61. Integration of
Akt1 and FoxO3a signaling illustrated
the role of Akt in
simultaneously regulating muscle protein synthesis and protein
degradation62.
Various pro-inﬂammatory signaling pathways activated by
cytokines, inﬂammatory transcription factors, and inﬂammatory
substrates have been implicated in muscle atrophy by affecting
muscle protein turnover or myonuclear turnover63,64. Unloading-
induced muscle atrophy has been consistently linked to an
elevation of inﬂammatory cytokines including interleukin-1-beta
(IL-1ß), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF-α)65. Furthermore, the transcription factor NF-
kappaB (NF-κB) is often elevated during mechanical unloading
and may contribute to the atrophy process12. We found that the
inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-6 and the p65 subunit of NF-
kappaB were markedly higher in the muscle myotubes after daily
cyclic stretching had been discontinued for three days (Fig. 4). The
large magnitude of upregulation for IL-2, IL-6, and p65 while
myotubes were in a humoral free medium clearly indicated that
circulating cytokines and endocrine factors could not exclusively
account for the marked elevation of inﬂammatory signaling.
Indeed, these
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
much
of
inﬂammatory medication in unloaded muscle ﬁbers could be
localized within the muscle ﬁbers. Therefore, upregulation of
inﬂammatory mediators during the loading period must be a
result of mechanosensing within the myotubes, rather than
circulatory factors.
Physiologically, a 2–3 fold elevation of IL-1ß and IL-6 would be
expected to stimulate pro-inﬂammatory signaling, oxidative stress,
protein degradation, and muscle atrophy66. Spaceﬂight and
hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy are not surprisingly char-
acterized by increased levels of IL-1ß and IL-667,68. Given that IL-1ß
and IL-6 can activate or be activated by NF-κB57, thus it was
expected that NF-kappaB subunit p65 would also upregulated
following cessation of daily cyclic stretch (Fig. 4C). NF-κB has
previously found to be involved in mechanical unloading-induced

muscle atrophy69–71. Upregulation of NF-κB, IL-1ß, and IL-6 can
lead to a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3
phosphorylation, consistent with a shift toward catabolic signal-
ing72. Therefore, it is likely that the large elevation of IL-1ß, IL-5,
and p65 contributed to suppression of anabolism, elevation of
catabolic signaling, and thus atrophy of the myotubes.
This study has some limitations, while the unloaded/micro-
gravity model was not free ﬂoating we argue that there is a
tradeoff is being able to induce cyclic tensile strain and release of
cyclic stretch bouts as a reasonable simulation of the unloading of
microgravity. Skeletal muscles are complex tissues that generate
tensile forces to produce body movement and stability. Muscles
adapt to changes in tensile loading by adjusting their mass and
cross-sectional area. When mechanical tensile loading is dimin-
ished or absent in vivo (e.g., spaceﬂight, casting, bedrest) during
periods of immobility or inactivity, muscle ﬁber cross-sectional
area is decreased in response. Even with the limitations outlined
above, myotubes in this study responded signiﬁcantly to bouts of
cycle stretch by myotube hypertrophy and underwent atrophy
when unloaded. Thus, our StrexCell model of increased and
release of tensile loading resulted in biological responses that
would be predictable given the physiological responses to
overloading and unloading in vivo.
While tensile loading produces stretch on the myotubes, there
is a limitation of a lack of contractile activity during stretch.
Indeed, StrexCell modules may not fully mimic resistive training
bouts, and there could be signiﬁcant differences in mechanosen-
sing, Ca2+ homeostasis, etc. the response of calpains to both
loading and unloading recapitulate in vivo responses to exercise
and disuse (Hyatt & Powers 2020). In addition, anabolic, catabolic,
and inﬂammatory responses would be predictable and consistent
with in vivo loading and unloading data.
While calpain activity is accepted as an important indicator of
cellular Ca2+ overload, we were unable to measure cellular Ca2+
directly, using a ﬂuorescence probe (e.g., ﬂuo-4), We will measure
[Ca2+] levels in future as well as additional, important markers of
Ca2+ overload such as SERCA1, SERCA2a, sarcolipin, etc.
In conclusion the development of a uniaxial bioreactor for
skeletal muscle will assist future studies, on the ground and during
spaceﬂight, to elucidate mechanisms that cause skeletal muscle
atrophy and remodeling during spaceﬂight. In addition, the
StrexCell bioreactor would allow direct testing of countermeasure
strategies against the adverse effects of spaceﬂight, including
microgravity and radiation. In this study, we tested and developed
an alternative bioreactor to mimic the effects of both overloading
and microgravity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by imposing
and withdrawing periods of cyclic tensile strain, using a StrexCell

uniaxial stretch system. The withdrawal of cyclic stretch was used
to demonstrate that mechanical inactivity turns off signaling for
muscle
hypertrophy,
while
elevating
pro-inﬂammatory,
pro-
catabolic pathways that drive protein degradation, thus causing
myotube atrophy. Therefore, we conclude that the StrexCell
uniaxial stretch system is a viable alternative bioreactor to study
spaceﬂight and re- (over)loading in skeletal muscle cells.
METHODS
Cell culture proliferation and differential protocol
We used a commonly used immortal cell line (C2C12) (American
Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA, USA) derived from mouse
skeletal muscle, generously provide by Dr. James Fluckey’s Muscle
Biology Laboratory at Texas A&M University. C2C12 cells were
capable of differentiation and are a widely used model to study
differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The C2C12 myoblasts were
cultured in a 10 cm2 chamber ﬁlled with Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium, growth medium (DMEM + NA Pyruvate), supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO235,73. Once the myoblast cultures
reached 60–65% conﬂuency, the myoblasts were then trypsinized
and re-cultured in 4 well-2 cm2 silicone chambers coated by
laminin at 37 °C and 5% CO2, using 1 ml per well. Once the cells
reached 70–80% conﬂuency, myotube differentiation was initiated
by switching to differentiation medium DMEM (-) NA Pyruvate,
supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
and 0.4% insulin-transferrin-selenium. To study the effects of
increased and decreased mechanical stress in C2C12 myotubes,
we maintained myotubes on laminin-coated silastic membrane
and initiated stretch through a StrexCell® system, then observed
the effects of stretch and cessation of stretch on cellular
responses34. Twelve hours after beginning differentiation, the
myotube
silicone
chambers
were
exposed
to
the
uniaxial
stretching using the StrexCell® unit. The differentiation medium
was refreshed daily under sterilized conditions.
StrexCell loading and unloading protocol
Cyclic stretch of skeletal muscle cell cultures or “myotubes” has
been used to mimic the loading pattern of skeletal muscle-
induced hypertrophy and atrophy74. However, several limitations
for the FlexCell system that could impair compatibility for research
in spaceﬂight, including the necessity of a powerful vacuum
pump, considerable weight, and difﬁculty generating true uniaxial
stretch. StrexCell® uses a stepper motor and modular contractile
cartridges to generate uniaxial stretch on muscle ﬁbers mounted
on the silastic membrane. StrexCell is automated and computer-
controlled, which enables precise control of the strain levels on
the cells, providing a consistent stretch at high and low
frequencies of 1–20%.
Myoblasts and myotubes on a StrexCell system were exposed to
uniaxial stress/tensile loads and release of tensile loading. While
the myotubes were not free ﬂoating, they are plated on laminin
that simulates the extracellular matrix/endothelium normally
attached to muscle ﬁbers surrounding myocytes. The myoblast
and myotubes were then suspended in an aqueous medium,
which induces equal pressure on all sides. At the micron level,
gravity is a relatively weak force compared with adhesions, ion
afﬁnity, intermolecular forces, and ﬂuid dynamics, especially in an
aqueous medium that surrounds the myoblasts and myotubes.
Importantly, adhesion to laminin allows controlled levels of
uniaxial stretch to be exercise on myotubes that simulates tensile
loading in an aqueous environment.

We used a StrexCell® STB-1400 (B-Bridge International, Inc.,
Cupertino, CA, USA) to apply a cyclic uniaxial stretch on C2C12
myotubes (Fig. 5a). The stretch instrument employs a computer-
controlled stepper motor to drive two metal frames apart. A
ﬂexible silicone chamber was attached to both frames, and the
chamber
was
stretched
and
released
in
a
programmable
sinusoidal oscillation. STB-1400 includes a 10 cm2 stretch chamber
model (Culture area: 3.2 × 3.2 × 1.0 cm), which supports up to 6
chambers simultaneously. The C2C12 cells (2 × 105 cells) were
seeded in silicon stretch chambers coated with laminin (Fig. 5a).
The amount of strain experienced by the myotubes was measured
as the percent change in the stretch from the starting position
(Fig. 5b). Based on the preliminary validation experiments and the
published report of Soltow, et al. (2013)35, the strain program was
set at 0.7 Hz frequency, 12% stretch using a sinusoidal wave
pattern for 1 hour/day for 2 or 5 days. Exposure to the uniaxial
cyclic
stretching
was
utilized
to
induce
hypertrophy
with
increased
loading.
Conversely,
cyclic
stretch
cessation
was
deemed off-transient unloading to induce myotube atrophy
release of cyclic tensile loads, with replicate control cultures
maintained under quiescent conditions with no applied cyclic
strain.
Twenty-four-hour-old myotubes were used at the commence-
ment of this experiment. Five different groups were assigned
(n = 4/group): (a) 2 days no stretch controls (no Stretch 2d), (b)
5 days no Stretch controls (no Stretch 5d), (c) 2 days cyclic
stretching (1 h/d) (2dHY), (d) 5 days cyclic stretching (1 h/d)
(5dHY), (e) 2 days cyclic stretching (1 h/d) + 3 days cessation of
stretching (3dAT). Myotubes cultures were collected at the end of
each group protocol to be ﬁxed for immunoﬂuorescence imaging
or homogenized using lysis buffer for western blot analysis.
Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy
Immunoﬂuorescence imaging was performed to observe cell
morphology. C2C12 myotubes were ﬁxed in a 4% paraformalde-
hyde (PFA) solution for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the myotubes were
washed three times with 1X PBS. Cell membranes were solubilized
for intracellular assays using a 0.5% Triton-X-100 for 3 min until
washed with 1X PBS. Myotubes were blocked with 1X PBS with
0.05% Tween20 and 5% goat serum for 30 min at RT. Myotubes
were then incubated with β-sarcoglycan (membrane marker)
primary antibody (1:200 β-sarcoglycan mouse mAb, abcam, Cat #
ab55683) for 1 h at RT, and subsequently washed with 1X PBS
(3 × 5 min). Myotubes were then incubated with the appropriate
secondary antibody (1:250 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Flour 488,
ThermoFisher, Cat # A-11029) for 1 h at RT, followed by washing
with 1X PBS (3 × 5 min) and then counterstaining with 1 µg/µl
DAPI. After washing with 1X PBS (3 × 5 min) and then double-
distilled water (2 × 5 min), slides were mounted with antifade
mounting medium (ProLong™Gold Antifade, Invitrogen, cat #
P36930). Myotubes immunoﬂuorescence staining was visualized
using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP8
Confocal Lightning GPU-based Deconvolution (20X, zoom 2.25,
emission wavelength 450–500 nm) in the Texas A&M Image
Analysis Core Laboratory. Images were analyzed using Leica LAS X
software v.4.3 and NIH ImageJ (Fiji. ImageJ v.1.53k) software for
ﬁber diameter assessment and nucleus quantiﬁcation.
Western immunoblot
Protein abundance was as described by Lawler et al. (2021)4 and
determined by Western immunoblot analysis. The whole-cell lysate
was collected using TRIS HCL lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The
protein concentration was measured using Bradford assay using a
microplate reader (Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector).
Twenty µg of protein samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and
electrophoresed at 120 V for 75 min using a Bio-Rad Protein III gel
box onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad: Hercules, CA). The
membranes were then blocked in a non-fat milk buffer (5% non-fat
milk in TBS) for 1 h. Following blocking, membranes were incubated
overnight (4 °C) in a blocking buffer with the appropriate primary
antibodies: Anabolic signaling (anti-total Akt (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell
Signaling Cat# 4691 S), anti-Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (rabbit
pAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 9271 S), anti-Talin (rabbit mAb; 1:500;
Cell Signaling Cat# 4021); Catabolic signaling with anti-Foxo3a
(rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 12829 S) and anti-phospho-
Foxo3a at Ser473 (rabbit pAb; 1:300; Cell Signaling Cat# 9464 L);
inﬂammatory markers anti-IL-1β (rabbit mAb; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling,
Cat #12703), anti-IL-6 (rabbit mAb; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Cat
#12912), and anti-P65 (mouse mAb; 1:500; abcam, Cat# ab32536).
Then, the membranes were washed with T-TBS (3 × 5 min) and
incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C.
Proteins were visualized using Clarity Western ECL Substrate
(BioRad, cat# 1705061) enhanced chemiluminescence detection
and developed using a Cytiva Amersham ImageQuant™800
Western Blot Imaging System (Cytiva). Quantiﬁcation was per-
formed by ImageQuant™TL10 v.10.2 and NIH ImageJ software
with Ponceau-S staining serving as a loading control.
Calpain activity
Calpain activity was performed using a Calpain Activity Assay
Fluorometric Kit (Abcam # ab65308) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions, using 20 µg of the whole-cell lysate (mixed
with lysis buffer provided with the kit). Calpain activities for each
sample were expressed as relative ﬂuorescence units (RFUs) per
milligram of protein per minute (RFU/μg/min). The ﬂuorescence
signal was detected at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission
using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode
Detector).
Statistical approach
Results were collected and processed for statistical analysis using
Prism 9.0 (GraphPad). One-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s post-hoc
analysis was performed to distinguish among group mean
differences and between the different variables with signiﬁcance
set at P < 0.05. A nested ANOVA design was used to quantify
myotube diameter.
