Abstract
The International Space Station (ISS) is a complex built environment physically isolated
from Earth. Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its
crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term
human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember’s microbial profile
from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different
time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from
eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental
samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight
were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environ-
ment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing
and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to
sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear
samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva
samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember’s skin samples are more
closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight
than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these col-
lections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and
rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a
crewmember’s microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We observed that the
microbiome of the surfaces inside the ISS resemble those of the crew’s skin. These data
support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of preventive mea-
sures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for long term space travel.

Introduction
An increased focus on the relationship between indoor buildings and human health has led to
a recognition that the International Space Station (ISS) is particularly well suited for studying
microbiome within structures because the orbiting outpost is a uniquely isolated “island” in
space [1]. Onboard the ISS, investigators can systematically track microbial arrival, circulation,
and transmission—unlike other settings used for studying microbiology of built environments,
such as homes [2], hospitals [3], submarines [4], subways [5], aircraft [6], or remote scientific
stations [7]. Moreover, the influx and outflow of microorganisms at the ISS generally occurs at
preplanned intervals when crewmembers, cargo, and experiments are exchanged between
transport spacecraft. For these reasons, the ISS is an unparalleled location for studying the
interactive dynamics between humans and microorganisms inside closed habitats. Compara-
tively, terrestrial efforts to monitor microbial dynamics in buildings must address a variety of
confounding study factors (e.g., ventilation, human occupants, environmental conditions such
as temperature, humidity).
Remarkably, up to 40% of microbial signatures inside terrestrial buildings are derived from
humans living or visiting the space [8], due to microbial debris associated with shedding, exha-
lation, expectoration, skin shedding, cuts in the skin, bladder and bowel waste [9]. Hospodsky
et al. [10] estimated that every hour approximately 10 million bacteria or fungi can be released
inside a built environment by a single human occupant. People with uncompromised respira-
tory tract and healthy immune systems can usually fight off potentially harmful microbes
residing within built habitats. However, human spaceflight introduces new risks that must be
considered because astronauts can become more susceptible to infections during long space-
flight missions [11]. The beneficial, benign or detrimental pathways associated with microbe-
host interactions in spaceflight remain poorly understood [12, 13]. Notably, recent ISS surveys
of habitable surface, air, and water samples observed novel species, some of which might have
become more abundant due to space-unique stressors including microgravity and solar/cos-
mic radiation [14–16]. It was also recently shown that Zinnia plants that were grown on the
VEGGIE system on the ISS, had succumbed to wilt and rot disease due to a fungal pathogen,
Fusarium oxysporum [17]. The plant pathogen was also isolated from surface wipes from the
Microbial Tracking -1 study [18]. Numerous spaceflight experiments testing Bacillus subtilis,
Bacillus pumilus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium reported mutations and a sub-
set of differentially expressed genes associated, or not associated with virulence [19–24]. Taken
together, the previous body of ISS microbiology research highlights many unknowns that can
only be addressed with more systematic, spatiotemporal measurements directly correlated to
ISS occupants. Collecting and interpreting microbial profiling data onboard will be crucial for
future mission plans (i.e., traveling to the Moon or Mars) where rapid crew return and Earth-
based medical interventions seem unlikely.
Recently, ISS surface samples from several locations were acquired and microbial diversity
profiles were documented utilizing shotgun metagenome [25] and amplicon (bacteria and
fungi) sequencing [26]. These investigations revealed a previously unmonitored richness of
microbial diversity inside the ISS [25, 27]. One study has, for the first time, examined correla-
tions between resident astronauts and the ISS surface microbiomes using 16S rRNA sequenc-
ing, and found that surface microbiome shares similarities to the skin microbiome [28]. The
study also presented evidence that the microbial communities of the gastrointestinal tract,
skin, nose and tongue change during the space mission. Recently, one astronaut was moni-
tored for a 1-year spaceflight study, and the gastrointestinal microbiomes pre-, during and
post-flight were analyzed and compared to a control subject on earth [29]. There were no sig-
nificant differences between the two subjects in the overall microbial diversity, though the

richness of the astronaut’s microbiome was lower than his control subject. Within the astro-
naut samples, there did not appear to be any significant decreases in richness or diversity in
inflight samples relative to pre-flight and post-flight samples.
Motivated by a predecessor Microbial Tracking-1 project described by Singh et al. [25] and
Checinska-Sielaff et al. [26], and the need for more comprehensive and metagenomic sequenc-
ing analysis of crew and environmental microbiome (including bacteria, archaea, fungi and
viruses), we conducted a study called Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) that aimed to measure the
relationship between environmental microorganisms and astronauts in spaceflight which
could be insightful for future mission planners assessing threats or benefits to astronaut health
(i.e., commensal, mutualistic, and pathogenic relationships). To achieve these objectives, eight
defined ISS surface locations were sampled two times over the course of six months from 2017
to 2018, DNA extracted, and microbial diversity were catalogued using shotgun metagenome
sequencing. Alongside these environmental surface samples, skin, ear, mouth, nostril and
saliva samples provided by a crewmember (pre-flight, inflight, and post-flight) were collected
to identify trends in temporal and spatial dynamics. Analyses with data collected from addi-
tional crewmembers will be needed to rigorously test identified trends. The overarching
hypothesis for MT-2 was that the arrival, 6-month stay, and departure of a crewmember to the
ISS could be sensed via an increase or perturbation of microbial similarity between crewmem-
ber body sites and various habitat surfaces. A related objective for MT-2 was to determine if
the astronaut microbiome would inherit microbiome from the ISS and if those taxa would be
retained months after returning from the mission.
Methods
Crewmember sample collection
Crewmember sample collection was a study approved by the Johnson Space Center Institu-
tional Review Board (IRB) under IRB protocol Pro1974. Informed Consent forms were
obtained and were part of the IRB approval. The crewmember was in spaceflight for a total of
135 days. Samples were collected from the crewmember at two time points (i.e., “day codes”)
pre-flight: 180 (±30) days and 90 days before flight (day codes L-180 and L-90 respectively);
three time points during flight: early (1st-2nd months), middle (2nd-4th months), and late (10
days before return) (day codes FD60, FD97, and R-9 (+126) respectively); and three time
points post-flight: one day after return (day code R+1) (+136), 30 days (day code R+30) (+165)
and 180 (±30) days after return (day code R+180) (+315). Body swabs include the mouth,
nasal cavity, forehead, armpits, navel, forearms (antecubital fossa), navel region, and the back
of both ears. Swabs were collected first thing in the morning, with no hygiene 6 hours prior to
the session. Multiple saliva samples were collected and associated with each day code: L-180
(-180, -178, -176, -174); L-90 (-90, -88, -86, -84); FD60 (+60, +62, +64, +66); FD97 (+97, +99,
+101, +103); R-9 (+126, +128, +130, +132); R+1 (+136, +138, +140, +142); R+30 (+165, +167,
+169, +171); R+180 (+315, +317, +319). Due to the low biomass from forehead, armpits, navel
and forearms, the DNA extracted from these four skin swabs were pooled for sequencing anal-
ysis. One saliva R+180 sample did not have a successful sequencing library preparation due to
poor DNA quality. The total number of samples for downstream analysis were 64 (Table 1).
For saliva sample collection, a sample was collected on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 of each pre-, dur-
ing, and post-flight time point (i.e., day code) to cover possible variations between different
days. Saliva samples were collected in the morning just after waking up and before eating and
drinking, and no exercise 4 hrs prior to collecting samples. SalivaBio Swabs (Salimetrics, LLC,
Carlsbad, CA) were used for saliva collection as described [30]. For skin and mouth, a polyes-
ter swab, EnviroTrans Saline 0.85% Swabs (SRK35 from Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA),

was used. Prior to sample collection, the subject was required to wear a pair of sterile gloves,
Kimtech Pure G3 Sterile Nitrile Gloves (Kimberly-Clark Professional, Roswell, GA). Each
swab was pressed on the skin or in the mouth and the nose with different pressure (light, mod-
erate, and strong) based on the sampling location and swabbed in serpentine or rotation pat-
terns. A control swab, waving the swab in the air for 10 seconds, was also collected at each
time point. The samples were frozen at or below -80˚C onboard the ISS and during transit
back to Earth and kept frozen until processed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
upon arrival.
For DNA extraction, saliva rolls and body swabs were vortexed in 4 mL of Phosphate Buff-
ered Saline (PBS) at maximum speed for 2 min. Two mL of liquid was collected, one mL for
bead beating to lyse the microorganisms that are hard to lyse without bead beating; and the
other mL was not subjected to bead beating in order to preserve the microorganism that might
be sheared by this procedure. The two fractions with and without bead beating (2 mL) were
then placed in a Maxwell cartridge for DNA extraction as described previously [25]. The DNA
was eluted in 60 μL sterile water. The procedure was repeated starting with the remaining 2
mL of liquid after vortexing so two tubes of 60 μL total DNA were collected. DNA extraction
was performed with the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accor-
dance with manufacture instructions using the Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV Total RNA purification
kit.
ISS surface sample collection
Environmental surface wipes were collected from the same locations and in the same manner
as previously described [25]. Briefly, eight locations within the US on-orbit segments were
sampled: Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3; US Laboratory Module; and Permanent Multipurpose
Module (PMM). In this paper, location #1 is labeled as “port_panel”; #2 as “WHC”; #3 as
“ARED_foot_platform”; #4 as “dining_table”; #5 as “overhead_4; #6 as “PMM_port_1”; #7 as
“lab_overhead_3”; and #8 as “port_crew_quarters”. The crewmember collected Flight 4 envi-
ronment surface samples. Flight 5 surface samples were collected after the crewmember had
departed. The number of samples and locations from Flights 4–5 in MT-2 and Flights 1–3
from MT-1 is shown in Table 2.
Sample collections were conducted using pre-moistened sterile polyester wipes (23 cm × 23
cm; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) that were placed in a sterile Ziploc bag and sent to the ISS as
described [25] except that samples were collected during early flight for Flight 4 (64 days after
launch), and mid-flight on Flight 5 (approximately 120 days after the crewmember’s departure
from the station). Collected samples were stored at 4˚C prior to return. This is in contrast to
samples from Flights 1–3, which were stored at room temperature due to power restrictions

[25]. Upon return, samples were processed and concentrated using the InnovaPrep concen-
trating pipettor [31]. DNA extraction was performed using the Maxwell 16 System (Promega,
Madison, WI) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.
Metagenomic sequencing
The Illumina NextSeq500 was used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing with the NextSeq
500/550 300 cycle High Output Sequencing Kit v2.5 (Catalog number 20024908, Illumina, San
Diego, CA), using 150 base pair, paired-end reads. DNA libraries were prepared for sequenc-
ing using the Nextera Flex DNA Library Preparation Kit (20018705, Illumina). Quality and
fragment size were assessed on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
Libraries were quantitated using the Qubit fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) and normalized to equivalent DNA quantities where possible, pooled, and diluted
according to the manufacturer’s standard recommendations. The numbers of Illumina read
pairs from 16 environmental surface (8 locations x 2 flights (F4 and F5)), 63 crewmember (one
sample failed to produce usable data) samples, and control samples are shown in S1 Table.
The metagenomic sequence data generated from the ISS surfaces in this study can be found
under NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number PRJNA497280. The
crewmember associated microbiome sequencing data is deposited in NASA Life Sciences Data
Archive (LSDA) (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Dataset). All intermediate analysis files are provided
in Supporting document as Zip File Archive (S1–S10 Datasets). The sample metadata is pro-
vided in S9 Dataset.
Taxonomic classification
Livermore metagenomics analysis toolkit analysis.
The metagenomic sequencing data
from crewmember samples and ISS surface samples from Flights 4 and 5 were analyzed using
the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. LMAT is a metagenomic analysis pipeline to
search for taxonomic identifiers associated with k-mers found in its reference genome database
[32, 33]. LMAT operates and is parameterized differently from the pipeline in [25] resulting in
potentially higher sensitivity. In recent metagenomic sequencing benchmarking studies,
LMAT was shown to have good limit of detection (~80% sensitivity for genomes with 0.04X
coverage), and precision in the range of 20–100%, which can be tuned by post-hoc threshold-
ing on abundance depending on whether remote homology detection is desired (e.g., mapping
shuffled reads to nearest phylum) [34, 35]. Reads mapping to the genus Homo were removed

prior to depositing to public databases. Counts of reads mapping to kingdom Metazoa, Viridi-
plantae, or which were not mapped at the kingdom level were removed, as well as reads map-
ping to synthetic constructs at the species level. Metagenomic sequences from Flights 1–3,
generated from MT-1 [25], were also re-analyzed using LMAT for consistency in analysis. Per
sample relative abundance of each genus or species in the LMAT database was estimated from
the proportion of reads assigned at the genus and species in each sample. For brevity, we refer
to this quantity as the proportion of the taxon throughout the remainder of the paper. Though,
this is a biased estimate because genome lengths and genome copy numbers vary across species
and even within a strain. In addition to cellular abundance, this variation affects the propor-
tion of reads sequenced from each taxon [36]. All LMAT read analysis files (all ranks, genus
level, species level) are included in supporting document as Zip File Archive (S5–S7 Datasets).
Alpha diversity estimation.
The alpha diversity of each sample was estimated separately
with the phyloseq (version 1.24.2) [37] and the vegan (version 2.5–4) [38] packages, using the
functions: estimate_richness, estimateR, specnumber, and renyi. We quantified alpha diver-
sity at both the genus and species level using Hill numbers of order a (Na) [39], also known as
the effective number of observed taxa. The effective number of taxa is weighted by each taxon’s
relative abundance of reads per sample [39]. Hill numbers of order a = 0, 1, and 2 correspond
to the following popular diversity indices: observed richness (i.e., N0 is richness, a.k.a, the
number of taxa seen), exponentiated Shannon index (N1 is exp(H)), and the reciprocal Simp-
son index (N2 is 1/S). Detailed methods are available in S1 Text Section 4.2.2.
Ecological distances.
Samples were visualized by non-metric multidimensional scaling
and Principal Coordinates Analysis (NMDS and PCoA) with Jaccard and Euclidean distances
respectively, using the function ordinate from the phyloseq package (version 1.24.2) [37]. Jac-
card and Euclidean distances were calculated between samples using phyloseq’s distance func-
tion. The read counts for each taxon (treated as compositions) were transformed to Euclidean
space via the centered log-ratio (clr) transform [40, 41]. Therefore, transformed values should
be interpreted as relative to the mean abundance in each sample. Crewmember samples,
Flights 4–5 surface samples from this study and Flights 1–3 surface samples from the MT-1
study were included in the analysis.
Sample distances were visualized within and between groups of interest: skin and flight sur-
faces from flights F1-5, body sites and Flight 4. Assessment of the differences among the sets of
between-group distances was done via Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test.
We additionally performed a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMA-
NOVA) [42, 43] to test whether these distances were significantly different within groups of
samples versus among groups. We used adonis2 from the vegan package (version 2.5–4) [38]
for the PERMANOVA, including terms for sequencing effort, surfaces vs crew, flight group,
flight status, whether the sample is oral (mouth or saliva), whether is sample is from skin or
Flight 4 or Flight 5 (See Section 5.3.2 PERMANOVA in S1 Text for detailed procedures).
Differential abundance.
The package ALDEx2 (version 1.12.0) [40] was used to trans-
form relative abundances prior to ordination (aldex.clr), and for testing for differentially
abundant taxa (aldex.glm). For each taxon and instance, the method performs both a Krus-
kall-Wallis test between conditions and a likelihood ratio test for including a condition term as
an explanatory variable in a generalized linear model (“glm” test). P-values are adjusted for the
false discovery rate (FDR) using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (reported as “kw.
eBH” and “glm.eBH” for the Kruskall-Wallis and glm tests, respectively). Finally, the multiple-
taxa-adjusted P-values for each taxon are averaged across the sampled Dirichlet instances.
Microbial Source Tracking.
SourceTracker models the composition of each “sink” sam-
ple as a mixture of compositions from presumed “source” environments using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation, producing an expected value for each sink’s contribution from each source over a

series of Gibbs sampling runs [44]. ISS surface samples were designated as sinks and the crew-
member sequences were designated as a source environment of sequencing reads that unam-
biguously map to species. SourceTracker adds an additional “Unknown” environment as a
source with uniform read counts to account for sources absent in the experiment. Source-
Tracker performed Gibbs sampling 10 times with a burn-in of 100 passes before drawing a
sample with the following default parameters: alpha1 = 0.001, alpha2 = 0.001, beta = 10.
Alpha1, alpha2, and beta-1 represent prior knowledge of uniform counts in the known and
unknown sources and in the sinks as a proportion of the number of reads in the sinks. Gibbs
samples were of size 1000 reads.
Results
Crewmember body site microbiome
Prevalent and abundant microbial genera and species.
Overall, sequencing reads from
crewmember samples were mapped to 1,394 genera and 5,192 species. The top 12 microbial
species detected from all crewmember samples pre-, during and post-flights are shown in
Fig 1. Ear and skin samples were dominated by Propionibacterium acnes, a common skin asso-
ciated bacteria [45]. Staphylococcus epidermidis is prevalent in both Ear and nostril samples.
Malassezia restricta and Peptoniphilus rhinitidis are prevalent in nostril samples. Mouth and
saliva samples were dominated Rothia mucilaginosa, Actinomyces sp. ICM47, Haemophilus
parainfluenza, and Veillonella sp. oral taxon 158. These organisms are associated with oral
microbiome [46]. The top five most abundant genera in each of the body site are shown in S2
Table. Propionibacterium was the most abundant bacterial genus in skin and ear. Streptococcus,
Prevotella, and Actinomyces are the top three genera in mouth and saliva. In nostril, Coryne-
bacterium, Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus are the most abundant. A detailed list of the
prevalent species and genera by sample type is included as Zip File Archive in supporting doc-
ument (S5–S7 Datasets).

Microbial diversity in crewmember saliva.
Alpha diversity. In saliva samples, a total of
748 genera detected were shared among pre-, during and post-flight samples, additionally, 59
taxa were unique to pre-flight, 93 to during flight and 80 to post-flight (S1 Fig). Alpha diversity
was quantified as the effective number of species or Hill numbers, N0 (Richness), N1 (exp
{Shannon’s diversity}), and N2 (reciprocal of Simpson’s diversity). Fig 2 shows the three diver-
sity measurements per saliva sample pre-, during and post-flight. All three diversity indexes
showed that the average species diversity at the two time points pre-flight (days -180, -90) were
similar. The species diversity decreased across the three time points during flight (days 60, 97,
126). N1 and N2 showed that the saliva microbial diversity gradually recovered across the three
time points post-flight (days 136, 165, 315), though still not to the same level as pre-flight. The
species richness (N0) recovered at day 136 and day 165 post-flight, but there was a drop at day
315, indicating that the species richness was not fully recovered after 6 months of return.

Differential abundance by flight state. The observations in alpha diversity changes in saliva
supported further investigation of differential abundance amongst flight states. Fig 3 shows the
relative abundance of the eight genera with smallest adjusted P-values for a differential abun-
dance test among pre-, during and post-flight samples (Kruskall-Wallis P < 0.02). The P-val-
ues associated with the eight genera area also shown in Fig 3. The relative abundance of
Microbacterium, Leuconostoc, Negativicoccus, Escherichia, and Atopobium during flight was
decreased. The abundance of Budvicia and Alloprevotella was elevated during flight. The abun-
dance of Alloprevotella, Escherichia, Negativicoccus, and Microbacterium in post-flight samples
returned to the level closer to pre-flight. The abundance of Atopobium and Leuconostoc post-
flight returned to the level more similar to pre-flight. Of these eight genera, abundance of Bud-
vicia has the most variation within pre- and post-flight states, with relative abundances both
above and below the sample averages. The full set of differential analysis at the genus level is
provided in Zip File Archive (S8 Dataset).
ISS surfaces microbiome
Reads were mapped to 1,351 genera and 5,281 species across all environmental surface samples
from Flights 4 and 5 (16 samples). Fig 4 shows the relative abundance of the top 12 species
across eight locations. Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most
prevalent in all eight surface locations from both Flights 4 and 5. Staphylococcus sp. AL1 and
Corynbacterium sp GD7 are the most dominant in port_Panel and PMM_port_1 from Flight
4, but not in Flight 5. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is more abundant in Flight 4 than Flight 5
in ARED_foot_platform and lab_overhead_3 locations. A detailed list of the prevalent species
and genera by sample type is included as zipped archive file in supporting document (S5–S7
Datasets).

Similarity of microbial profiles from crewmember and ISS surface samples
Beta-diversity estimates the differences between two microbiomes or samples by quantifying
the overlap of shared taxa between them. The similarities and differences between crewmem-
ber and surface samples were visualized using NMDS with Jaccard distances (Fig 5). Flights 4
and 5 surface samples are more similar to crewmember samples than Flights 1–3 from previ-
ous Microbial Tracking -1 study. Within crewmember samples, skin samples appear to overlap
with ISS surface samples, and they are closer to surface samples than other crewmember sam-
ples including saliva, mouth, nose and ear. When the during flight skin sample group was
compared to each of the Flights 1–5 surface sample groups, the distances were different among
flights (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.001). The median distance between skin microbiome to Flights 4
and 5 surface microbiomes were smaller than to Flights 1–3 (S2 Fig). When Flight 4 and skin
samples were compared, a large percentage of species in skin were shared with F4 surfaces,
with the during flight samples sharing the most species (pre: 93.8%, during: 97.0%, post:
94.6%) (S3 Table).
The distances between all of Flight 4 surface samples and each of the during flight crew-
member body sample groups (ear, mouth, nostril, saliva and skin) were also compared, and
the medians differ among body sites (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.001) (S3 Fig). Additionally, PER-
MANOVA analysis showed that body sites rather than flight state (pre, during and post) were
more important in explaining differences among samples (P = 0.001 vs P = 0.152) (S1 Text
Section 5.3.4 and 5.3.5). For ISS surface samples, PERMANOVA analysis showed that Flight
numbers rather than surface locations were more important in explaining differences among
samples (P = 0.001 vs P = 0.267).
Microbial contribution from crewmember to surfaces
SourceTracker was used to assess the proportion of sequences in the F4 and F5 microbiomes
that could be expected to come from the crewmember microbiome (Fig 6). F1-3 data was also
included for comparison. The proportion of crewmember sequences contributing to the F4
microbiome was on average 56%, ranging from 20% at Dining Table to 89% at WHC. Flight 4

environmental surface wipes were collected two months after the crewmember arrived on the
ISS. The crewmember’s microbiome persisted even after their departure from the ISS and was
still evident during the F5 sampling event, which occurred four months after the crewmember
had departed. The proportion of the crewmember’s sequences during F5 sampling was on
average 42% and ranged from 25% to 57%. The average contribution from the crewmember to
F4 versus to F5 were not statistically different (P = 0.27 paired t-test). As expected, there was
negligible predicted contribution from the crewmember to F1, F2 and F3 as these were sam-
pling dates prior to the crewmember’s arrival.
Comparison of surface microbiome from Flights 4–5 to Flights 1–3
In Flights 4 and 5, 208 microbial genera were seen in each sample (100% prevalence in 16 sam-
ples). In Flights 1–3 which were conducted under MT-1, 42 genera were seen in each sample
(100% prevalence in 21 samples). The top 12 most abundant genera from both studies are
shown in S4 Fig. The top three genera, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus from
Flights 4 and 5 are also among the top 15 in MT-1 (Flights 1–3) (S4 Table). The overall number
of detectable genera that are shared between samples from MT-1 and MT-2 were 990 (70% of
all MT-1 or MT-2 genera), 361 genera were unique to MT-2 (26%), while 54 were unique to
MT-1 (4%) (S5 Fig). The detailed list of genera detected from MT-1 vs MT-2 and the preva-
lence of the genera in each study is included in S10 Dataset. Additionally, the genera that are

Discussion
Learning the rules governing microbial communities is important for the advancement of
spaceflight activities. In a relatively small mostly closed environment, the consequences of
these communities deviating from normal could present significant challenges—as minor as
increased cleaning time to food, air, and water problems that can have negative implications
for crewmember health and the success of the whole mission. Studies have shown that the
environmental microbiome can affect both the human microbiome and human health out-
comes such as metabolic and immune function [47]. Human occupancy is also a source of
indoor bacteria such as Propionibacterineae, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae,
and Corynebacterineae [48]. Better understanding of these microbiome interactions between
humans and the shared environment will require continued monitoring, sampling, and devel-
opment of effective detection and statistical analysis methods. A first step in understanding
Fig 6. Assessment of astronaut contribution to the ISS microbiome. SourceTracker was used to assess the proportion of crewmember 1 microbiome
sequences to Flight 4 and Flight 5 ISS surface microbiome sequences. This was done by comparing the species compositions of reads found in the
crewmember inflight samples (“source”) with those of various flight samples (“sink”). The expected proportion of reads contributed by crewmember 1
for each sink (i.e., surface location, by flight) is shown along the x-axis. The standard deviation of the predicted proportions for each sink was either 0.00
or 0.01, computed from 10 Gibbs samples per sink location, and thus treated as point estimates. The mean contribution per flight across surface
locations (diamond) and its standard error are shown in red.

what normal microbial dynamics look like in human spaceflight is collecting data from ongo-
ing successful missions.
Voorhies et al. have taken one of the first steps to show that the astronaut microbiome is
affected by long term spaceflight and confirm that astronaut skin microbial composition is
similar to ISS environmental surfaces [28]. The NASA twin study also monitored microbiome
changes pre, during and post-flight, though no significant changes were observed [29]. The
present data is the initial report of a study employing metagenomic sequencing to analyze the
composition of crewmember microbiome at the ISS and its association ISS environmental
microbiome, leveraging an extensive taxonomically annotated sequence database and a fast
and sensitive k-mer based read mapping strategy. This is the first study to report an in-depth
analysis of crewmember saliva microbiome changes due to spaceflight conditions.
The current study is limited to one crewmember subject. Analysis of samples from addi-
tional crewmember subjects will increase statistical significance and confidence of the observa-
tions. The current study has the most saliva samples since four saliva samples were collected
every other day over a week for each of the eight time points (two pre-flight, three inflight and
three post-flight). The saliva samples allowed better exploration of alpha diversity over time. In
this study, environmental samples cross different flights grouped more strongly by flight than
by location. The limited flights in this study could influence these observations and findings.
In this study, 63 samples from one crewmember and 16 environmental surface wipe sam-
ples collected from two separate flight missions were analyzed by metagenomic sequencing.
Similar to other human microbiome studies, we have observed Propionibacterium as the most
abundant bacterial genus in skin and ear. Propionibacterium was also the most abundant bac-
teria found on the surfaces of the ISS, present in all 16 surface samples analyzed from Flights 4
and 5 (Fig 4). When compared with ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember (Flight
4, collected in June 2017), another flight in the same MT-2 study (Flight 5, collected in January
2018) and three previous flights conducted in the prior MT-1 study (Flights 1–3, collected
between March 2015 to May 2016), it was observed that the crewmember skin samples were
more closely related to Flights 4 and 5 environmental samples than Flights 1–3, and skin sam-
ples were more similar to the ISS surface samples than saliva, mouth and nostril samples (Fig
5). The SourceTracker results (Fig 6) predicted that the crewmember microbiome contributed
to 55% of the Flight 4 surface microbiome and 42% of the Flight 5 microbiome, averaged
across all eight locations, with the largest contribution being at the WHC, the ARED foot plat-
form, and the port crew quarters.
With the SourceTracker and ordination results together, we are inclined to believe that there
could be an exchange of microbial composition between crewmember skin samples and sur-
faces at the ISS. This observation of microbiome exchange between crewmember microbiome
and surface microbiome was also supported by another recent NASA research effort [28].
The oral microbiome is the second most diverse microbial community in the human body
with distinct health and diseased state [49]. The effect of spaceflight on oral microbiome pro-
vides a good view of human microbiome. Environmental disruption can alter the microbial
balance and lead to the overgrowth of pathogens. This could lead to tooth decay, gingivitis,
and periodontal disease which can cause major discomfort and, in some cases, require medical
treatment. In rare cases, poor oral hygiene can also result in more serious and life-threatening
conditions such as endocarditis and heart-disease [49, 50].
The alpha diversity measurement in the crewmember’s oral microbiome is comparable to a
previous study on core oral microbiomes from several healthy volunteers [51] and Human
Microbiome Project [52, 53]. Saliva samples showed the most interesting trend of decreasing
species diversity in the three time points during flight and increasing effective number of spe-
cies (N1, N2) in post-flight time points, though not fully to pre-flight levels (Fig 2). The overall

species richness (N0) decreased post-flight, which may be limiting N1 and N2. Saliva samples
have been used by NASA researchers to study astronaut immune changes and health condi-
tions. Herpesviruses were detected from saliva samples from crewmembers during spaceflight
[30, 54], suggesting that saliva samples have the potential to serve as biomarkers to monitor
crew health. The observation of a decreased in-flight alpha diversity in saliva microbiome
could be due to the space conditions (e.g., microgravity, radiation) that can cause certain
microbes to colonize and reduce overall diversity. This could also be driven by immune
response changes associated with space travel. Several of the differentially abundant bacterial
genera detected from saliva such as Mycoplasma [55] and Microbacterium [56] are considered
opportunistic pathogens and could infect immunocompromised patients. Alloprevotella has
been found to be associated with dental caries [57].
The microbial profiles from environmental surface samples from the current study showed
both similarities and differences with the previous Microbial Tracking -1 study. The top three
genera, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus from Flights 4 and 5 in this study are
also among the top 15 in MT-1 (Flights 1–3) (S4 Table). The overall number of detectable gen-
era that are shared between samples from MT-1 and MT-2 are 1,059. This data supports the
notion that the microbial profiles in the ISS exhibit both spatial and temporal changes. The
most abundant microbes seem to persist over time, but the overall composition and distribu-
tion of microbiome evolves over time. However, there is a difference on how the samples were
stored during transport from ISS to Earth. The surface wipes from Flights 4 and 5 were stored
at 4˚C while the wipes from Flights 1–3 were stored at room temperature due to the lack of
stowage facility during transport from ISS to Earth. This difference in storage condition could
have contributed to some microbial variances.
Shotgun sequencing of metagenomic samples is valuable for microbial community data col-
lection because it interrogates all genetic components in a complex sample. This study is lim-
ited to taxonomic analysis from metagenomic sequencing data from one crewmember body
swabs and two surface sampling experiments. Additional analysis of functional components of
the microbiome such as metabolic genes, virulence genes, antibiotic resistance genes will pro-
vide further understanding of the relationships between crewmember and space microbial
profiles and potential impacts to crew health.
The international Space Station is a specialized built environment. There are constant and
dynamic microbial exchanges between environment, microbes and humans in an enclosed
environment. The space conditions including microgravity and radiation impact the human
microbiome composition and potentially cause a dysbiosis of the health microbiome. Analysis
of samples from additional crewmembers will further our understanding of the fluctuation of
the microbiome pre-, during and post-flights from this crewmember. Taxa that are differen-
tially abundant between conditions or environments, and over time, can be potentially devel-
oped as taxonomic markers for targeted biosurveillance that may be more feasible for inflight
assays and be less expensive than shotgun sequencing. Investigation in this general direction
holds potential for developing technology to forecast and respond to health impacts.
