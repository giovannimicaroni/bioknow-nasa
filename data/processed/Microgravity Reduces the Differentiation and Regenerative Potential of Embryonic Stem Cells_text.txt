Abstract: Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention
in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic
stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell
pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell
proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human
adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres
in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 µm) and cultured using a
wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased
the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers),
respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels
of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for
proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We
believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.

1. Introduction
Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are easily isolated therapeutic stem cells
from adipose tissue. They have increasingly been used to ameliorate a broad range of
refractory diseases, including irradiated tissue [1], ischemic wounds [2], and diabetic
ulcers [3]. However, their clinical efﬁcacy has been limited because the long-term survival
of transplanted hASCs is diminished by environmental stress [4–6]. Consequently, hASC
therapeutic mechanisms have been limited to the secretion of cytokines and growth factors
to promote cell recruitment, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and
angiogenesis [7–10]. In contrast, embryonic stem cells retain their potency and are thought
to be superior to adult stem cells for regenerative potential [11]. However, the use of
embryonic stem cells is limited by ethical issues [12].
Modern research has made gains toward a better understanding of stem-cell hetero-
geneity [13,14]. Within stem-cell pools (previously thought to be homogenous), a surprising
degree of subpopulation dynamics in gene expression has been revealed related to tissue
regeneration, cell survival, proliferation, and stemness [15]. This concept of functional
individuality within a stem-cell pool is especially important for hASCs, because cells with
higher functional properties would be expected to have more promising therapeutic bene-
ﬁts through an increased capacity to survive under difﬁcult conditions, to differentiate into
various mesenchymal cell types, and to home into damaged tissues [16–18]. One example

of a highly functional hASC candidate is the multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring
(Muse) cell, which can be isolated from hASCs using its expression of stage-speciﬁc em-
bryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3) [19] and has been reported to have novel potential for liver
cirrhosis [20], brain infarction [21], and aortic aneurysm [22] treatments.
An additional problem is that the expansion of such highly-pluripotent cell popu-
lations is quite difﬁcult. Adhesion-based cultures, the standard technique for in vitro
expansion of hASCs, are known to lead to a gradual quiescence in stemness indicated,
for example, by a decline in CD34 positivity [23]. In contrast, suspension-type cultures
have also been used successfully for temporary cultivations of Muse cells, and although
the mechanism is unknown, it has been reported that a microgravity (i.e., weightless)
environment had a positive effect on stem-cell cultures for maintenance of their original
potencies [24]. However, the forced-ﬂoating of hASC cultures using non-adherent dishes
caused spherical aggregations and oxygen/nutrient diffusion limits, which resulted in
central necrosis in hASC spheroids [25]. There is, therefore, an urgent need for new and ad-
vanced culture techniques to permit the selective expansion of hASC subpopulations with
improved properties for proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, immunosuppression,
and stress-resistance.
The microcarrier system was ﬁrst introduced in 1967 for the growth of ﬁbroblasts [26],
and has been used for the expansion of other adherent cells such as chondrocytes [27],
hepatocytes [28], neural stem cells [29], and hASCs [30,31]. Microcarriers are usually
small spherical particles which can adhere to cultivated cells and are characterized by
higher surface-to-volume ratios that can accommodate higher cell densities compared
to monolayer cultures. Most importantly, under the dynamic conditions of continuous
shaking, microcarrier culturing has a multidirectional gravity effect on the adhered cells,
effectively mimicking ﬂoating cultures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate
the ability of dynamic microgravity culturing of hASCs using microcarriers to selectively
expand highly functional stem-cell subpopulations.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Primary Culture of hASCs
Human lipoaspirates were obtained from 12 healthy female donors, average age
42.2 ± 9.3 years (mean ± SD) and average body mass index of 22.4 ± 1.8 kg/m2, who
underwent abdominal liposuction. Each patient provided written informed consent, and
the research protocol was approved by the institutional review board. The stromal vascular
fraction (SVF) was isolated from the lipoaspirates as described previously [23]. Brieﬂy,
aspirated fat tissue was digested using 0.075% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Osaka, Japan) at 37 ◦C for 30 min on a shaker. After centrifugation (800× g for 10 min),
SVF cells were obtained as cellular pellets, ﬁltered through 100, 70, and 40 µm mesh, and
resuspended. The SVF cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 nucleated cells/100 mm
dish and cultured at 37 ◦C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in humid air. Cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium with Ham’s F-12 (DMEM/F12; Wako
Pure Chemical Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cells were
cultured until near conﬂuence. Then, the adherent cells were released using a proteolytic
enzyme treatment (TrypLE Express, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), deﬁned as passage
0 (P0) hASCs, and transferred to another dish. Once the adherent hASCs reached 80%
conﬂuency, cells were passaged using TrypLE Express, and P3 hASCs were used in the
following experiments. Using a multicolor ﬂow cytometer (MACS-Quant, Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), P3 hASCs were characterized for the positive expressions of
CD73, CD90, and CD105 and the negative expression of CD45 before use.
2.2. Characterization of SSEA-3-Positive Cells in the hASC Pool
First, SSEA-3 marker expression was assessed in normal hASCs using ﬂow cytometry.
Adherent P3 hASCs from each donor were detached using TrypLE Express, centrifuged,
and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were sieved through 100

Cells 2021, 10, 560
3 of 18
and 40 µm mesh ﬁlters, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended for analysis.
The isolated cells were incubated with rat anti-SSEA-3 antibody (1:50; BioLegend, San
Diego, CA, USA) and detected using an ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat
IgM (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using a multicolor
ﬂow cytometer (MACS-Quant). Control gates were set based on staining with a labeled
non-speciﬁc antibody (matched isotype control immunoglobulin G (IgG)); no more than
0.1% of the cells were deemed positive using the non-speciﬁc antibody.
To assess the stress durability of SSEA-3-positive cells, adherent P3 hASCs were ex-
posed to a variety of optimized stress conditions (heat, 45 ◦C for 1 min; low-pH solution
(pH = 5) for 60 min; proteolysis, TrypLE Express for 20 h at 37 ◦C; hypotonia, Milli-Q
water for 1 min; and mechanostress, transferred 30 times between two syringes through
a connector with a small hole). One day after stress exposure, cell numbers and viability
were measured using a dual-ﬂuorescence automated cell counter (Luna-FL, Logos Biosys-
tems, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), and SSEA-3 positivity was detected by ﬂow cytometry after
gating dead cells from live cells using 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD, BD Biosciences)
ﬂuorescence (n = 12).
2.3. Preparation of Microspheres
Two kinds of microspheres were used as cell carriers during cell culture. First, crosslinked
polystyrene microspheres (Polystyrene Beads Large, Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA)
with diameters between 200−300 µm were used. For good cell attachment, the polystyrene
surfaces were hydrophilized using a 30 min plasma treatment from a vacuum plasma
apparatus (YHS-DϕS, Sakigake-Semiconductor, Kyoto, Japan). Ten grams of polystyrene
microspheres (approximately 2.4 million microbeads with a total surface area of 4000 cm2)
were washed three times in 70% ethanol for sterilization and diluted in 15 mL of PBS.
Secondly, collagen microspheres (100−200 µm diameters, Cellagen; Koken, Tokyo, Japan)
manufactured from reconstituted collagen obtained from bovine skin and crosslinked
with 0.5% hexamethylene diisocyanate were used. Pre-sterilized vials (15 mL) contained
approximately three million collagen beads with a total surface area of approximately
4000 cm2.
2.4. hASC Loading onto Microspheres for Microgravity Culture
The two types of microspheres were washed with PBS and resuspended in warm
culture medium overnight (DMEM/F12) prior to use. Polystyrene and collagen micro-
sphere solutions (0.3 mL), representing a total surface area of approximately 80 cm2, were
added to 3.5 cm diameter, non-adherent, polystyrene dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY,
USA). The dishes were placed onto a continuous-action shaker (Wave-PR, Taitec, Saitama,
Japan), capable of shaking the microspheres in three dimensions by combining movements
from two axes (rotary and seesaw). As a result, the cumulative gravity vector toward the
microspheres was minimized towards zero (i.e., microgravity). The unit was driven by a
computer system which allowed for the adjustment of rotation speed and shaking angle
(see Video S1).
For each dish on the shaker, 1 × 105 P3 hASCs were suspended in 300 µL of DMEM/F12
and incubated at 37 ◦C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in humid air. After allowing
the mixture of cells and microcarriers to settle for 30 min, 2 min of shaking was started at a
setting of 10 rpm and a shaking angle of 6 degrees, and then stopped for a further 28 min.
This 30 min procedure was repeated eight times (4 h total) to allow the cells to adhere to the
microspheres circumferentially. Then, DMEM/F12 was added (1.5 mL) and the suspension
was stirred continuously at 15 rpm at a 6◦shaking angle. Using this continuous stirring,
the cells experienced a microgravity environment while being strongly attached to the
microspheres. Culturing continued for up to two weeks, and the culture medium was
changed twice per week as follows; after allowing the microspheres to settle, half of the
supernatant was exchanged for fresh medium.

2.5. Cell Retrieval from Microspheres
When ready for analysis, the cell–microcarrier complexes obtained from the culture
dishes were transferred to new tubes (15 mL) and sedimented. For each tube, the super-
natant was removed, and the complexes were washed using PBS. Cells were enzymatically
released by incubation with 5 mL of TrypLE Express for 15 min at 37 ◦C. Cell suspensions
were diluted with additional culture medium (5 mL) and sieved through 100 and 40 µm
mesh collector screens. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600× g for 5 min, and then
resuspended for analysis. No microcarriers (fractured or intact) were seen in the retrieved
cell suspensions.
2.6. Cell Growth in Microsphere Cultures
Numerical measurement of viable cells cultured on polystyrene and collagen micro-
spheres, or in polystyrene and collagen dishes was carried out using a dual-ﬂuorescence
automated cell counter (Luna-FL). P3 hASCs (1 × 105) were seeded onto polystyrene and
collagen microspheres under dynamic conditions, or onto polystyrene and collagen dishes
as static monolayer cultures. The cells were retrieved by trypsinization and counted on
days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14, and growth rates were calculated (i.e., hASC growth rate = hASC
number on day 7/day 1). Data were gathered from six separate samples. Visualizations of
hASCs cultured on polystyrene and collagen microspheres were carried out on day 7 using
a light microscope (Leica DM-LB, Wetzlar, Germany) and a scanning electron microscope
(SEM; S-3500N, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at a beam energy of 25 kV. For the observing the
collagen microspheres, a cryo-SEM technique at −130 ◦C was used so as not to scatter and
lose uncharged microspheres.
2.7. Proliferation of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs in Microsphere Cultures
To determine whether microsphere culturing and/or dynamic conditions enhanced
the proliferation of highly functional hASCs, we assessed cell number, viability, and SSEA-
3-positivity using ﬂow cytometry in six groups: hASCs retrieved from either polystyrene or
collagen microcarriers under dynamic conditions, those retrieved from either polystyrene or
collagen microcarriers under static conditions, and those retrieved from either polystyrene
or collagen dishes. The number of SSEA-3(+) cells was measured after seven days of
culture under each condition, and growth rates were calculated (i.e., SSEA-3(+) growth
rate = SSEA-3(+) cell number on day 7/day 0). Six separate samples were used for the
data analysis.
2.8. Immunocytochemistry
P3 hASCs were cultured for seven days on polystyrene or collagen microspheres, and
in polystyrene or collagen dishes, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were
incubated for 16 h (4 ◦C) with the following primary antibodies: anti-OCT4 (GeneTex,
Irvine, CA, USA); anti-SOX2 (GeneTex); anti-NANOG (N3C3, GeneTex); and anti-SSEA-3
(EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). All primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in a
solution of PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin. Appropriate secondary antibodies (1:200
dilutions of either goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594, goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor
488, or goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594) were incubated with cells for 1 h at room temperature.
Finally, cells were washed with PBS and treated with Hoechst 33342 (1:500; Dojindo,
Kumamoto, Japan) for 10 min. Stained cells were visualized as 30 µm Z-stack ﬂuorescence
images collected in 1.5 µm steps taken by a ﬂuorescence-equipped microscope (Keyence,
Osaka, Japan).
2.9. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from hASCs cultured with either polystyrene or collagen
microspheres under dynamic conditions, polystyrene or collagen microspheres under static
conditions, and from those cultured on normal polystyrene dishes (control) for seven days

Cells 2021, 10, 560

using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by reverse transcription.
RT-PCR was performed using a StepOnePlus RT-PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, USA) using a fast SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
and the primers listed in Table 1. Expression levels were calculated by a comparative CT
method relative to a common endogenous reference gene, ACTB. Data were taken from
three separate samples.

2.10. Colony-Forming Assay
P3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under
dynamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then seeded (1 × 102 cells)
into polystyrene 6-well plates. Cells were incubated at 37 ◦C for ten days, ﬁxed with
methanol, stained with cresyl violet solution, and then counted using digital imaging
software (Photoshop; Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) (n = 6).
2.11. In Vitro Angiogenesis (Network Formation) Assay
P3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under
dynamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then cell-network for-
mation was assessed. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was applied to 96-well plates (50 µL per
well) and polymerized (30 min at 37 ◦C). After incubation in endothelial basal medium
(EBM; Cambrex, Walkersville, MD, USA) containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h as
a pretreatment, 5000 cells (resuspended in 50 µL of EBM) were plated into the Matrigel
wells and cultured for 6 h. Branch formation was observed with phase microscopy, and the
lengths of cytoplasmic extensions per ﬁeld were calculated (n = 6).
2.12. Multilineage Differentiation Assay
P3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under dy-
namic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then differentiated into adi-
pogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages (n = 3). Cells were seeded into polystyrene
6-well plates and incubated in DMEM/F12 until conﬂuent. Adipogenic/osteogenic differ-
entiation was initiated using either adipogenic medium (Adipolife; Lifeline Cell Technology,
Frederick, MD, USA) or osteogenic medium (Osteolife; Lifeline Cell Technology). After
culturing for 21 days (medium changed every three days), adipogenic ability was analyzed
qualitatively with oil red O staining and quantitatively with AdipoRed reagent (Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland). Osteogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively using von Kossa staining
and quantitatively by Calcium-E testing (Wako Pure Chemicals). Chondrogenic differen-
tiation was conducted using a micromass culture system; hASCs were resuspended in

Cells 2021, 10, 560
6 of 18
chondrogenic medium (Chondrolife; Lifeline Cell Technology) and centrifuged (800× g
for 5 min). Half of the medium was changed after centrifugation every two days. After
two weeks, chondrogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively using Alcian blue staining and
quantitatively by measuring micromass diameters.
2.13. Statistics
Data were analyzed using SPSS package 23.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and
Kyplot 2.0 (Freeware). Based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, the data were normally dis-
tributed within the donor populations. Therefore, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and Bonferroni adjustments for post-hoc comparisons were used to determine signiﬁcant
differences between means (p < 0.05 representing signiﬁcance, unless otherwise stated).
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs
Cells were expanded for three passages before characterization using ﬂow cytometry
and combinations of mesenchymal-cell surface markers. We found that 94.9 ± 3.3% of
cells were positive for CD105, CD90, and CD73, and that 99.5 ± 0.3% were negative for
CD45. Then, the total number of cells, their viability, and SSEA-3-positivity of viable cells
were assessed in normal hASCs (control) and in ﬁve kinds of stress-treated hASCs. One
day after stress exposure, even though all stressed groups showed signiﬁcant reductions
(62.4–74.2%) in viable cells compared to the control group, stressed cells exhibited higher
proportions of SSEA-3(+) cells (heat, 2.1%; low pH, 3.1%; proteolysis, 4.2%; hypotonia, 2.2%;
mechanostress, 1.4%) compared to controls (1.3%) (Figure 1A). No signiﬁcant differences
were detected in the overall numbers of SSEA-3(+) cells between stress-treated hASCs
and normal hASCs, with the exception of the mechanostress group, which showed a
signiﬁcantly lower number of SSEA-3(+) cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 1B,C).
3.2. Cell Growth in Microgravity Microsphere Cultures
Adherent cells are continuously affected by the downward force of gravity throughout
the culture period, but cells attached to continuously stirred microspheres are affected by
multidirectional gravitational forces (i.e., microgravity) (Figure 2A). The numbers of hASCs
were decreased in both polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures on day 1, suggesting
that some cells did not successfully adhere to the microbeads (Figure 2B). However, the
growth rates (i.e., hASC number on day 7/day 1) used to estimate true cell proliferation
showed no signiﬁcant differences between groups (polystyrene microsphere, 6.0; collagen
microsphere, 6.0; polystyrene dish, 5.7; collagen dish, 5.8). On day 14, there were no
signiﬁcant differences in the numbers of hASCs retrieved from each culture, possibly
because the monolayer cultures reached conﬂuency. Visualizations of hASCs that were
adhered to polystyrene and collagen microspheres at culture-day 7 revealed their successful
proliferation (Figure 2C).
3.3. Proliferation of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs in Microgravity/Microsphere Cultures
As described above, the numbers of viable hASCs on day 7 were lower in the
microsphere-cultured groups, regardless of the material (polystyrene or collagen) or the
condition (dynamic or static), compared to the dish-cultured groups (Figure 3A). However,
when compared to polystyrene monolayer cultures (as controls), the static-condition
polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures produced 2.3-fold and 2.2-fold propor-
tional increases, and 1.2-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the numbers of SSEA-3(+) hASCs,
respectively (p < 0.05 for both). In addition, the dynamic-culture conditions produced
4.4-fold and 4.3-fold proportional increases, and 2.7-fold and 2.9-fold increases in the
numbers of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to the dish cultures, respectively (p < 0.001 for
both) (Figure 3B,C). These results indicate positive effects for both the microsphere and
microgravity conditions on SSEA-3(+) cell proliferation and on SSEA-3(+) cell growth rates
(i.e., growth rate = SSEA-3(+) cell number on day 7/day 0) Table 2.

All of the pluripotent stem-cell markers examined were expressed in hASCs cultured
in microgravity/microsphere cultures (Figure 4). The images represent those ﬁelds where
the most signiﬁcant differences between the dish groups and the microsphere groups were
detected. Notably, hASCs cultured on polystyrene microcarriers showed strong OCT4 and
SOX2 staining, while hASCs cultured on collagen microcarriers showed strong NANOG
and SSEA-3 staining. By comparison, the hASCs cultured in both polystyrene and collagen
monolayer cultures stained either negative, or weakly positive, for these stemness markers.

3.5. Selected Gene Expression Analysis by RT-PCR
We used RT-PCR to compare the expression of several genes involved with stemness
and mesenchymal differentiation in hASCs from microgravity/microsphere cultures to
their expressions in hASCs from dish cultures (n = 3). The hASCs cultured with polystyrene
microspheres under dynamic conditions exhibited signiﬁcantly upregulated OCT4, SOX2,
KLF4, and CD34 expressions, while hASCs cultured with collagen microspheres under
dynamic conditions showed up-regulations of SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF4, and CD34 ex-
pressions (Figure 5). In contrast, hASCs from microsphere cultures under static conditions
(both polystyrene and collagen) displayed no statistically signiﬁcant differences for all the
genes examined.

3.6. Colony-Forming Assay
After 10 days of culture with an initial seeding of 1 × 102 cells per well, we counted cell
colonies as an estimate of proliferative ability. We found a signiﬁcantly higher number of
colonies in the polystyrene microsphere group (p = 0.027) and in the collagen microsphere
group (p = 0.025) compared to the polystyrene dish group (n = 6) (Figure 6).

3.7. In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay
The network-formation assay showed that hASCs cultured with polystyrene and col-
lagen microspheres formed complex, capillary-like networks more quickly and intricately
than dish-cultured hASCs (Figure 7A). Accordingly, the lengths of cytoplasmic extensions

were also signiﬁcantly longer in the polystyrene- and collagen-microsphere groups com-
pared to the dish group (p < 0.001), whereas the microsphere material (polystyrene or
collagen) had no signiﬁcant effect (Figure 7B).

3.8. Multilineage Differentiation Assay
Based on lineage-speciﬁc differentiations, hASCs that were cultured on polystyrene
and collagen microspheres displayed higher levels of adipogenic and osteogenic differenti-
ation compared to hASCs cultured in polystyrene dishes (controls) using intracellular lipid
content (adipogenic) and calcium deposition (osteogenic) assessments (Figure 8). However,
while hASCs cultured on collagen microspheres did display higher levels of chondro-
genic differentiation compared to controls, those cultured on polystyrene microspheres

showed similar chondrogenic differentiation compared to controls using an assessment of

4. Discussions
Through novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have
been shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer poten-
tially greater translational beneﬁts. SSEA-3(+) Muse cells, a representative type of highly
functional mesenchymal stem cell, are known to show superior multipotency compared
to regular stem cells [32]. However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow
hASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with
higher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs to only
approximately 1% [19]. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical and environmental
stress greatly inﬂuences proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and the multipotency
of stem cells [33,34]. Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been
the most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant inﬂuence on
cultured cells.
Numerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell
proliferation [35] and differentiation [36,37]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cul-
tured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38].
Therefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated,
unaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to
previous studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity
vector to an average of 10−3× g over time [24]. In our experimental system, although
cells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the micro-
spheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells’ gravity
vectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their ﬁnal cumulative gravity
vectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been
developed [39,40], but they involve signiﬁcant costs and are very difﬁcult to standardize.
Moreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-
proliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions
for the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41].
In previous studies, micro-scale carriers fabricated from a variety of natural and syn-
thetic polymers have shown signiﬁcant potential for cell growth, speciﬁc differentiation,
and the delivery of hASCs [42,43]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation
has been carried out on the feasibility of culturing cells using stirred microspheres for the
stated purpose of mimicking a microgravity environment. The outcomes of this study
exceeded our expectations. Seven days of polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures
under static conditions produced an increased number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to
polystyrene dish cultures, and those under dynamic conditions exhibited a much higher
number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. These results clearly revealed a positive inﬂuence of micro-
spheres on the selective proliferation of SSEA-3(+) cells, especially in those experiments
combined with a microgravity environment.
By comparison, our stress-exposure treatments were not very suitable for the expan-
sion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. Heneidi et al. reported that Muse cells could be isolated from
lipoaspirates using severe cellular stress, such as long-term exposure to collagenase [44].
We also conﬁrmed that exposure to proteolysis produced the best results among our stress
conditions, increasing the proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs by 3.3-fold (4.2%) compared
to monolayer cultures (1.3%). During preliminary studies (unpublished data) to enhance
the ratio of SSEA-3(+) hASCs (known to be stress-tolerant [19,32]), stress magnitude was
carefully optimized in each experiment. However, because 37.6% of viable cells were lost,
the ﬁnal number of proteolytic solution-treated SSEA-3(+) hASCs was only 1.3-fold more
(1.7 × 103) compared to the controls (1.3 × 103), with no statistically signiﬁcant difference.
These results suggest that exposure to severe stress can concentrate SSEA-3(+) hASCs
through the selective depletion of SSEA-3(−) cells, but such stress can also inhibit cell
proliferation. Instead of concentration, microsphere cultures under microgravity condi-
tions increased SSEA-3(+) hASCs by proliferation (Figure 9). In other words, the present
microgravity culture conditions increased not only the proportion, but also the number,

Cells 2021, 10, 560

of SSEA-3(+) cells to actualize regenerative therapies requiring these highly therapeutic
cells. However, a limitation of this study is that we only assessed SSEA-3 as a pluripotent
marker in stress-exposure experiments. Additional research including analyses of the other
pluripotent markers (e.g., Oct4 and Sox2) may further emphasize the differences between
microgravity cultures and stress-exposure cultures, or reveal new characteristics of the
two cultures.
Figure 9. Schematic representation of the study. Human adipose-derived stem cells are normally capable of heterogeneous
potency. Exposure to stress can selectively deplete regular stem cells, but does not increase the number of highly functional
stem cells. In contrast, microgravity/microsphere cultures can selectively cause the proliferation of highly functional cell
subpopulations to reach the numbers required for regenerative therapies.
Furthermore, hASCs harvested from microgravity–microsphere cultures had higher
expression levels of the pluripotent markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF, and CD34
compared to hASCs cultured in monolayers. OCT4 and NANOG are known to be involved
in the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells, while SOX2, MYC, and KLF expression
act as transcription factors to control genes involved during embryonic development [19].
CD34 has been reported to contribute to the proliferative ability of hASCs both by us [23,45]
and by others [46,47]. However, the upregulation of nuclear stem-cell markers was hardly
detected in hASCs from static microsphere cultures, suggesting that the microgravity
environment may play a key role in preserving hASC functionality. In a previous report,
spaceﬂight experiments demonstrated that altered gene expression was associated with
epigenetic changes, such as chromatin re-modeling and DNA methylation [48]. The present
results extend these observations by demonstrating improved proliferation, angiogenesis,
and differentiation into mesenchymal lineages (adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes)
in hASCs from microgravity–microsphere cultures compared to hASCs from cultures under

Cells 2021, 10, 560

normal conditions. However, the fold change of the genes analyzed by RT-PCR was not so
large in this study (less than 1.5), and future studies are required for further qualiﬁcation
of these genes through optimization of the microgravity culture protocols.
Interestingly, the efﬁcacies for collagen and polystyrene microspheres to select for
proliferation in highly functional hASCs were roughly equivalent in the present study.
Polystyrene microbeads require a plasma coating prior to use to enable good cell attach-
ment; therefore, collagen microbeads may be the superior practical choice for regenerative
therapy applications. In addition, as a biodegradable biomaterial, collagen has the ad-
vantage that such beads may be clinically administered into a target organ together with
hASCs; it may even augment hASC survival and functionality after transplantation by
acting as a biological cell scaffold [1,42].
5. Conclusions
We cultured hASCs with microspheres using three-dimensional movement to create
microgravity conditions for the preservation of stemness, while at the same time preserving
cell–microsphere adhesion to maximize cell quantities. This new cell-culturing technique
selectively enhanced the proliferation of highly functional stem cells, demonstrating supe-
rior stemness, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenic abilities, which may provide for
enhanced treatments for intractable human diseases compared to current hASC treatments.
However, further studies are required to optimize a culture protocol to maximize the
selective expansion efﬁciency and to investigate the therapeutic value of these cells using
in vivo experiments before clinical trials can proceed.
