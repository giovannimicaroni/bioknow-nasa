The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for
receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafﬁcking to the vacuole.
TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil
protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is
required for efﬁcient protein trafﬁcking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant
has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence,
decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin
analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin
asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant,
suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence.
During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella
to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant,
indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes.
Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during
root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafﬁcking of auxin transport
proteins.

INTRODUCTION
The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from
the two or three trans-most cisternae of the Golgi (Staehelin and Kang, 2008) and is crucial for
endocytic, secretory and vacuolar traﬃcking routes in plant cells. TGN cisternae move rapidly
inside the cell, dissociating from their associated Golgi and re-associating with a new Golgi stack
(Staehelin and Kang, 2008; Kang, 2011; Uemura et al., 2014), and also contain distinct subdomains
for various traﬃcking routes (Bassham et al., 2000; Chow et al., 2008; Gendre et al., 2011).
The TGN functions as an early/recycling endosome (Dettmer et al., 2006; Viotti et al., 2010)
that receives endocytosed cargo, including auxin transporters, plasma membrane receptors, and
nutrient transporters (Russinova et al., 2004; Robatzek et al., 2006; Dhonukshe et al., 2007; Takano
et al., 2010; Barberon et al., 2011), and recycles it back to the plasma membrane or to the vacuole
for degradation. The TGN plays a crucial role in traﬃcking of biosynthetic traﬃc to the vacuole
(Reyes et al., 2011). It also directs secretory cargo, including plasma membrane proteins and cell
wall polysaccharides, to the cell surface, potentially via mobile secretory vesicle clusters that fuse
with the plasma membrane (Toyooka et al., 2009; Gendre et al., 2014). The position of the TGN at

TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence
the junction of the endocytic, vacuolar, and secretory pathways
renders it important in regulating transport of key molecules
and mediating cellular responses to the environment (Park and
Jurgens, 2011; Reyes et al., 2011; Contento and Bassham, 2012).
High transport ﬁdelity is needed to prevent mis-sorting
of cargo during vesicle traﬃcking. This requires membrane
fusion
proteins
termed
soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs; Risselada and
Grubmuller, 2012). SNAREs can be broadly classiﬁed as target
SNARES (t-SNAREs) or vesicle SNAREs (v-SNAREs) depending
on their location, or as Q or R-SNAREs based on the core amino
acid in the heptad repeat of the SNARE motif (Fasshauer et al.,
1998). The interaction between a v-SNARE on a vesicle and
t-SNAREs on its target membrane leads to membrane fusion
via formation of a tetrameric trans-SNARE complex (McNew
et al., 2000; Lipka et al., 2007; Kim and Brandizzi, 2012; Risselada
and Grubmuller, 2012). Usually, three Q SNAREs (Qa, Qb,
and Qc) form a t-SNARE complex and an R-SNARE acts as
the v-SNARE. This interaction of SNAREs helps to overcome
the thermodynamically unfavorable event of fusion of two
hydrophobic lipid bilayers (Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012;
Shi et al., 2012), enabling deposition of cargo into the target
organelle. Proteins known as tethering factors aid in bringing
membranes together and promoting SNARE interaction or
actively stimulating trans-SNARE complex formation (Cai
et al., 2007). Tethering factors thus increase vesicular traﬃcking
eﬃciency (Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Chia and Gleeson, 2011;
Hong and Lev, 2014) and are either homodimeric long coiled-coil
proteins or multisubunit tethering complexes (Markgraf et al.,
2007; Hong and Lev, 2014). It was recently proposed that coiled-
coil tethers simultaneously use their multiple coiled-coil domains
to engage distinct SNAREs and promote SNARE complex
assembly (Grabski et al., 2012). Spatiotemporal regulation
of traﬃcking steps in the cell also requires a family of small
GTPases called Rabs which then recruit downstream eﬀectors
(Stenmark, 2009). Tethers can act as Rab eﬀectors by binding
SNAREs or can function as GTP exchange factors (GEFs) for
Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007; Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Hong and
Lev, 2014).
Many SNAREs and tethering factors exist in Arabidopsis
thaliana, with diﬀerent localizations reﬂecting their specialized
roles (Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012). The TGN-localized SYP4
(41/42/43) SNARE family (Bassham et al., 2000; Uemura et al.,
2012) is responsible for maintaining Golgi/TGN morphology
and regulating secretory and vacuolar traﬃcking (Uemura
et al., 2012). Another TGN SNARE, SYP61, interacts with
SYP41 and helps to direct traﬃc to the plasma membrane
(Drakakaki et al., 2012), with a role in mediating stress responses
(Zhu et al., 2002). Recently, TGN-localized SYP41-interacting
protein (TNO1), a large coiled-coil protein localized to the
TGN, was identiﬁed as a SYP41 interactor (Kim and Bassham,
2011) and was hypothesized to be a tethering factor. Mutant
plants lacking TNO1 partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo and
mis-localize SYP61, suggesting decreased traﬃcking ﬁdelity,
while also showing hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress
and displaying altered TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham,
2011).
SYP42 and SYP43 play a role in root gravitropism, most likely
via regulation of the localization of the auxin eﬄux transporters
PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) and PIN2 (Uemura et al., 2012).
Additionally, other proteins involved in auxin transport, such as
the AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family of auxin inﬂux
transporters and P-glycoprotein (PGP) proteins of the ATP-
binding cassette transporter family, are localized via the SNAREs
and TGN activity (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Rakusová et al.,
2015). Many of the auxin transporters undergo constitutive
endocytosis, cycling between the recycling endosome/TGN and
the plasma membrane, or are targeted for vacuolar degradation
to maintain steady-state levels (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008;
Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Defects in TGN dynamics can,
therefore, hamper recycling of these transporters and thus
aﬀect directional transport of auxin, which is critical for plant
development (Grunewald and Friml, 2010).
Given the potential links between TGN-mediated protein
traﬃcking
and
auxin
transporters,
we
investigated auxin
responses in the tno1 mutant during root development. Loss of
TNO1 delayed lateral root (LR) emergence and decreased root
and hypocotyl gravitropic bending. Additionally, tno1 roots failed
to display characteristic asymmetry visualized with the auxin
response marker DR5rev:GFP at the LR tips as well as after
gravistimulation. Thus, TNO1 functions in auxin-mediated root
development and response to gravity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Material and Growth Conditions
The A. thaliana seed stocks used in this study have been
previously described: Col-0 (wild-type, WT), tno1 knockout
mutant (SALK_112503; Kim and Bassham, 2011), complemented
tno1 mutant (Kim and Bassham, 2011), and DR5rev:GFP
(Ottenschlager et al., 2003).
Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1%
(v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed ﬁve times with sterile water
and kept in the dark at 4◦C for at least 2 days. Arabidopsis plants
were grown at 22◦C in long-day conditions (16 h light) in soil
or on 0.25× or 0.5× solid Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (MS
vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose,
2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 0.6% (w/v) phytoblend agar (Caisson,
PTP01).
Gravitropism Assays
The hypocotyl gravitropism assay was modiﬁed from Stanga et al.
(2009). Seeds were plated on 0.5× MS medium (Murashige and
Skoog, 1962) containing 1% sucrose in square plates and kept
vertically oriented in the dark. After 5 days, the plates were
rotated 90◦for gravistimulation. Pictures were acquired using
a Canon Rebel XTS camera in a dark room with a green ﬁlter
over the ﬂash to prevent phototropic curvature of the hypocotyl
toward the camera ﬂash. Zero-hour images of each seedling were
compared to later time point images of the same seedling using
Image J (Schneider et al., 2012) to determine bending angles.
For root gravitropic assays, sterilized seeds were mixed
with molten growth medium just before solidiﬁcation and

poured into square plates (Stanga et al., 2009). After 5 days of
vertical growth the seedlings were gravistimulated by rotating
the plate by 90◦. Pictures were taken 6 and 24 h after
gravistimulation and analyzed using Image J to assess gravitropic
curvature.
For root and hypocotyl gravitropic rescue assays, the roots
of 5-day-old vertically grown seedlings were overlaid with
media containing either 100 nM 1-napthylacetic acid (1-NAA;
Sigma–Aldrich, N0640), 30 nM 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA; Sigma–
Aldrich, I2886), or 30 nM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D;
Gibco, 11215), followed by gravistimulation. Pictures of roots and
hypocotyls after 12 h were compared to 0-h images using Image J.
For all assays, at least three biological replicates were performed,
with 15–20 seedlings per replicate.
LR Density Analysis
To determine the density of emerging LRs, sterilized Arabidopsis
seeds were plated on 0.25× MS medium (Murashige and Skoog,
1962) containing 1% sucrose and grown vertically. After 10 days,
the number of LRs emerging from the primary root were
counted and divided by the root length to obtain LR density.
For determination of LR primordia density, 7-day-old roots
were cleared with 2.5% bleach for 10 min and visualized with
an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope. To assess rescue of
LR emergence, 5-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium
containing 100 nM 1-NAA or 1 µM IAA in the dark (to prevent
photo-degradation). After 5 additional days, the number of
emergent LRs was scored. For each analysis, three independent
biological replicates were performed with 15–20 seedlings per
replicate.
Root Length Inhibition Assays
Seedlings were grown on 0.5× MS medium (Murashige and
Skoog, 1962) with 1% sucrose for 5 days. They were then
transferred to media containing either 2,4-D, IAA, 1-NAA, 1-
N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; Naptalam, Sigma–Aldrich,
33371), 1-napthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA; Sigma–Aldrich, 255416)
at the concentrations indicated, or solvent controls [dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol], and the position of the root tip
was marked. Each plate contained all three genotypes (WT, tno1
mutant, and complemented lines) to compensate for possible
eﬀects of inter-plate variation. After 6 days, pictures were
acquired and the length from the marked root tip position was
measured using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Root elongation
in the presence of the tested chemicals was compared with solvent
controls and expressed as percent decrease in root length. At least
three biological replicates with a minimum of 20 seedlings per
replicate were conducted for each treatment.
Analysis of Auxin Response Distribution
tno1 plants expressing DR5rev:GFP were generated by crossing
tno1
(Kim
and
Bassham,
2011)
with
DR5rev:GFP
lines
(Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Homozygous tno1 plants carrying the
DR5rev:GFP transgene were selected in subsequent generations
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping as
previously described (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) ﬂuorescence visualization. For analysis
of auxin redistribution, control and tno1 roots expressing
DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated and visualized with a Leica
SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems)
at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility.
A 40× oil immersion objective lens was used along with
excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 507 nm for GFP
visualization. Images were acquired under identical conditions
for both mutant and WT roots with equal exposure, scan
frequency and line average settings. A total of 15 seedlings
from at least three independent replicates were analyzed. GFP
asymmetry was quantiﬁed using Image J by subjecting the
confocal images to similar thresholding and post-processing.
Equal volume boxes were drawn on the upper and lower ﬂanks
and total pixel intensity from the lower vs. upper box was
expressed as a ratio. To analyze DR5rev:GFP expression in LRs,
a total of 30 stage II LRs from at least six diﬀerent seedlings were
imaged by confocal microscopy for each genotype. The number
of root tips showing asymmetry of GFP expression was counted
and expressed as a percentage of the total observed.
FM4-64 Staining and Brefeldin A (BFA)
Treatment
FM4-64 staining was modiﬁed from Dettmer et al. (2006). To
test bulk endocytosis, 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to
0.5× MS liquid medium containing 4 µM FM4-64 for 2 min
and subsequently washed twice for 30 s each time in 0.5×
MS liquid medium before microscopic analysis. For analyzing
arrival of FM4-64 at Brefeldin A bodies, 4-day-old seedlings
were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium containing 35 µM
Brefeldin A (BFA) for an hour followed by a 10-min treatment
with 4 µM FM4-64 plus 35 µM BFA and two subsequent washes
of 30 s each. The root tips were visualized using a Leica SP5
confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) at the
Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility, using
a 63× oil immersion objective lens and excitation and emission
wavelengths of 558 and 734 nm. Images were acquired under
identical conditions for both genotypes with equal exposure,
scan frequency and line average settings. A total of 15 seedlings
from at least three independent replicates were analyzed for each
treatment and genotype.
RESULTS
TNO1 Mediates LR Emergence in an
Auxin-dependent Manner
Auxin signaling pathways are integral to LR development during
root architecture establishment (Lavenus et al., 2013). Polar auxin
transport mediates emergence of LRs from the primary axis, and
several auxin transport mutants display slow rates of emergence
(Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ruegger et al., 1997). The SYP4
family of SNAREs is thought to be involved in directional auxin
transport (Uemura et al., 2012), hence we tested whether the
SYP41-interacting protein TNO1 may also be required for such
processes. We hypothesized that if the tno1 mutant has defects in
auxin transport or responses, visible phenotypes such as changes

TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence
in LR emergence would be evident. Emergent LR densities were
signiﬁcantly lower (P < 0.05) in tno1 seedlings after 10 days of
growth on 0.25× MS medium (Dubrovsky and Forde, 2012).
Mutant lines expressing transgenic TNO1 under the control of its
native promoter, termed complemented lines (Kim and Bassham,
2011), were similar to WT seedlings (Figures 1A,B). Since the
major source of auxin in the root in the ﬁrst 10 days after
germination is transport from the leaves (Hobbie and Estelle,
1995; Ljung et al., 2001), one possible reason for this defect
may be that auxin ﬂux is reduced in tno1, leading to suboptimal
auxin levels in the root and impairing LR emergence. To conﬁrm
that the delayed emergence was not due to an arrest or delay
in LR initiation, the number of LR primordia was evaluated in
the mutant roots. The LR primordia density of tno1 roots was
equivalent to that of WT and complemented lines (Figure 1C),
suggesting that LR initiation events were normal in tno1.
The lipophilic auxin 1-NAA has been shown to rescue LR
defects in the auxin transport mutant aux1 (Marchant et al.,
2002). Natural auxin (IAA) treatment also rescues LR emergence
in dark conditions (Reed et al., 1998). To test whether the
emergence defect may be due to defects in auxin transport and
hence reduced root auxin levels, LR emergence in the presence
of 1-NAA (Murashige and Skoog, 1962; Marchant et al., 2002)
or IAA in the dark (Reed et al., 1998) was assessed. Five-day-old
seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM NAA or
1 µM IAA, and LR density was analyzed after 5 days of growth.
The LR density of tno1 resembled that of WT and complemented
lines in the presence of either auxin (Figure 1D), indicating that
exogenous auxins can rescue the emergent LR defect in tno1
roots. Therefore, TNO1 inﬂuences the temporal control of LR
emergence from the primary root.
TNO1 is Required for Gravitropic
Bending
We further examined a possible role for TNO1 in plant
auxin responses by investigating gravitropism. Gravitropism
involves the bending of a plant organ in response to its
change in orientation with respect to gravity (gravistimulation).
Gravitropic bending of organs upon gravistimulation is aided
by a readjustment of auxin ﬂow. Since a number of proteins
involved in gravitropic curvature are recycled and traﬃcked
via the TGN (Strohm et al., 2012), this organelle is critical for
regulating downstream events that inﬂuence gravitropic plant
organ bending. We, therefore, hypothesized that loss of TNO1
might aﬀect dynamics at the TGN and thus lead to a change in
the gravitropic bending response.
To test this hypothesis, the gravitropic response of WT and
tno1 mutant hypocotyls and roots was assessed. The tno1 mutant

TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence
hypocotyls (Figure 2A) and roots (Figure 2B) showed delayed
bending, and the angle of curvature at diﬀerent time points was
signiﬁcantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of WT or complemented
seedlings. This suggests that the loss of TNO1 causes a delay in the
gravitropic bending of Arabidopsis roots and hypocotyls. Mutant
roots and hypocotyls have a similar length to WT under normal
growth conditions (Kim and Bassham, 2011), suggesting that the
defect in gravitropism is not due to defective growth.
The gravitropic bending response requires a reprogramming
of auxin ﬂow inside the shoot and root (Tanaka et al., 2006;
Strohm et al., 2012), raising the possibility that the slower
bending rate observed in tno1 could be due to changes in
auxin ﬂow. We hypothesized that if the gravitropic phenotype
in tno1 mutants is due to defect(s) in auxin transport, it may
be rescued by exogenous auxin application. To test this idea, we
used the membrane-permeable auxin 1-NAA, which has been
previously used to rescue gravitropic root bending defects in
mutants defective in auxin transport (Marchant et al., 1999), the
natural auxin IAA, and the inﬂux-speciﬁc auxin 2,4-D. Following
auxin treatments, the bending angles of tno1 roots were not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (P > 0.1) from the bending angles of the
WT and complemented lines (Figure 2C), indicating rescue of
the gravitropic bending defect by exogenous auxin. The 2,4-D
treatment led to an overall reduction of bending angles as has
been previously reported (Surpin et al., 2005) but there were
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between WT and mutant. Similarly,
hypocotyl bending was also rescued after a 12-h treatment
with either IAA or 1-NAA (Figure 2D), conﬁrming that the
gravitropic defect in tno1 mutants is most likely due to auxin-
related defects. 2,4-D did not rescue the gravitropic defect in the
mutant hypocotyls, with bending angles signiﬁcantly lower than
WT and complemented lines; this is consistent with previous
reports demonstrating an eﬀect of 2,4-D on gravitropism in roots
but not in hypocotyls (Surpin et al., 2005). The tno1 mutant

TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence
defects in gravitropic bending, therefore, may be due to defects
in auxin transport or response.
tno1 Roots Show Increased Sensitivity to
2,4-D and IAA
Auxin ﬂux into plant cells is facilitated by inﬂux carriers such as
AUX1 and the LAX family of transporters, while exit from the cell
involves eﬄux carriers belonging to the PIN and PGP families
(Peer et al., 2011). Auxin analogs and transport inhibitors are
important tools to uncover defects in auxin transport pathways.
The auxin analog 2,4-D is an inﬂux-speciﬁc substrate while
1-NAA is an eﬄux-speciﬁc substrate (Delbarre et al., 1996).
The auxin transport inhibitor NPA interferes with auxin eﬄux
while 1-NOA interferes with auxin inﬂux and inhibits AUX1
(Thomson et al., 1973; Sussman and Goldsmith, 1981; Yang
et al., 2006). To determine the eﬀect of these inhibitors on
the tno1 mutant, their eﬀects on root growth were assessed.
We found that tno1 roots were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) more
sensitive to 30 nM 2,4-D than WT or complemented roots
(Figure 3A). This result is consistent with our observation of
the failure of 2,4-D to rescue the gravitropic defect of mutant
hypocotyls.
One possible explanation for this sensitivity is that inﬂux
routes are altered in the tno1 mutant, which led us to test
the eﬀect of blocking auxin inﬂux with 1-NOA. Mutant roots
showed similar sensitivity to WT and complemented lines
across a range of concentrations of 1-NOA (Figure 3B),
suggesting that blocking auxin inﬂux aﬀects the tno1 mutant
to the same extent as wild-type. 1-NOA has a characteristic
protective eﬀect against root growth inhibition by 2,4-D (Parry
et al., 2001); we, therefore, tested whether 1-NOA could
rescue the root growth inhibition of mutant roots by 2,4-D
to comparable levels as in the WT and complemented lines.
Seedlings were transferred to medium containing 30 nM 2,4-
D and 10 µM 1-NOA. The WT and complemented lines
showed a signiﬁcantly lower inhibition of root length than
the mutants (P < 0.05), indicating that when auxin inﬂux is
blocked, tno1 mutants still have enhanced sensitivity to 2,4-D
(Figure 3C).
To determine whether the sensitivity to 2,4-D is also seen
with other auxins, root growth inhibition on 40 nM IAA in
the dark was assessed. tno1 mutant roots are indeed more
sensitive to IAA (P < 0.05) than WT or complemented lines
(Figure 3D). By contrast, treatment with 0.1 µM of the
membrane-permeable NAA inhibited the growth of tno1 to a
similar extent as WT and complemented plants (Figure 3E).
Since 2,4-D and IAA are inﬂux-speciﬁc substrates and NAA
is not, the results are consistent with a possible defect in

plants had similar responses to NPA treatment (Figure 3F),
suggesting that the auxin eﬄux pathway is unaﬀected in
tno1.
TNO1 Helps Mediate Auxin Responses
during LR Elongation
Lateral roots emerge perpendicular to the primary root and
gradually start bending rootwards. Recently emerged LRs, which
lack an elongation zone (stage I LR) gradually transition into
stage II LRs, deﬁned by an elongation zone and asymmetric
growth of the upper and lower epidermal cell ﬁles (Rosquete et al.,
2013). The diﬀerential growth peaks in the stage II LRs are due
to asymmetric auxin distribution, which in turn is dependent
on auxin transport mechanisms. Stage II LRs are thus deﬁned
by a characteristic asymmetric distribution of auxin response,
which results in diﬀerential cellular elongation and downward
root growth. This asymmetric auxin ﬂux at the LR tip is caused
by the speciﬁc activity and distribution of auxin transporters
(Rosquete et al., 2013). The asymmetric auxin distribution
pattern diminishes signiﬁcantly as the LRs mature to Stage III and
begin growing parallel to the primary root. It was reported that
on average more than 75% of stage II LRs in WT plants display
asymmetric distribution of auxin responses at LR tips (Rosquete
et al., 2013), visualized by the pattern of DR5rev:GFP expression
(Friml et al., 2003).
Since TNO1 is linked to LR emergence by a possible
auxin-dependent mechanism, we hypothesized that asymmetric
auxin transport or response is defective in tno1 LRs. Hence,
the percentage of LRs showing asymmetric auxin responses
in stage II tno1 LR tips would be lower compared to WT
(or complemented) root tips. To test this, the percentage of
stage II LRs with auxin response asymmetry in WT and
tno1 background lines expressing DR5rev:GFP was determined
by confocal microscopy. 40% of tno1 stage II LRs displayed
auxin asymmetry at the LR tip compared to 80% in WT
stage II LRs (Figures 4A,B). Thus, tno1 roots are defective in
establishing the correct pattern of auxin response during LR
development. This defect could explain the lower emergent LR
density observed in tno1 compared to WT, since a disruption
of auxin ﬂow or establishment of asymmetry would prevent LR
emergence.
TNO1 Facilitates Shootward Auxin
Response during Root Bending
Normally, gravitropic bending of the primary root leads to
an eventual return of the root tip toward the gravity vector.
This occurs via a cascade of signals leading to asymmetric
auxin ﬂow from the columella cells to the lateral rootcap
cells and eventually shootward through the epidermal and
cortical cells (moving toward the root–shoot junction). During
this process, auxin accumulates on the lower side of the
root, leading to growth inhibition, while the top of the root
continues to elongate, thus resulting in downward root bending
(Ottenschlager et al., 2003; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010; Baldwin
et al., 2012). Since tno1 roots are defective in gravitropic bending
FIGURE 4 | TNO1 helps mediate auxin response asymmetry at lateral
root (LR) tips. (A) Representative confocal images of stage II LR tips of WT

were analyzed.
(Figure 2) and the frequency of LR tips displaying auxin
response asymmetry is lower than in WT LRs (Figure 4), we
hypothesized that the defect in root bending could be due to
a decrease in shootward transport of auxin from the columella
to the lateral rootcap cells and on to the distal elongation
zone.
To test this hypothesis, vertical plate-grown WT and
tno1 seedlings expressing DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated by
rotating the plates by 90◦. Confocal images were acquired
before gravistimulation and subsequently at 5, 8, and 12 h after
gravistimulation for both WT and tno1 root tips (Figures 5A–D).
In the WT background, GFP ﬂuorescence progressed shootward
from the columella toward the lateral rootcap and epidermal
cells of the lower side of the root. Conversely, the shootward
appearance of ﬂuorescence in tno1 was severely inhibited and
failed to reach WT levels (arrowheads in Figures 5B–D). The
diﬀerence in GFP ﬂuorescence intensity on the upper and lower

ﬂanks was expressed as a ratio for each genotype at diﬀerent time
points. This ratio was signiﬁcantly higher for WT roots than for
tno1 mutants at all time-points, suggesting a stronger response
in WT than in the mutants (Figure 5E). This in turn implies
that the defect in gravitropic bending in tno1 mutants may be
due to a decrease in auxin transport, or a diﬀerence in auxin
response, from the columella to the lateral rootcap and epidermal
cells on the lower side of the gravistimulated root. Such a defect
could explain the reduced bending observed in tno1 roots. Since
auxin asymmetry within LR tips has been suggested to occur by a
similar mechanism (Rosquete et al., 2013), this could also explain
the lower percentage of stage II LRs displaying auxin response
asymmetry in tno1.
TNO1 is not Required for Bulk
Endocytosis
Auxin transporters such as the PIN proteins are continuously
endocytosed to the TGN and recycled back to the plasma
membrane to maintain an appropriate density, thus allowing
steady auxin ﬂux through plant cells (Kleine-Vehn and Friml,
2008; Friml, 2010). Defects in endocytosis and components

Roy and Bassham
TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence
involved in the endocytic route to the TGN can, therefore,
cause a defect in auxin transport pathways. Since tno1 mutants
show defects in TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011)
and display auxin-related defects, we hypothesized that loss
of TNO1 might alter endocytic routes and/or arrival of cargo
at the TGN. This in turn would manifest in altered auxin
transporter traﬃcking dynamics, and subsequently alter auxin
responses. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed endocytosis in
root epidermal cells using the lipophilic styryl dye FM4-64,
which is endocytosed and labels early endosomes. To capture
early endocytic events, roots of 4-day-old seedlings were stained
with 4 µM FM4-64 for 2 min and then washed twice for
30 s each time in MS medium. Both WT and tno1 root cells
showed similar endosome labeling patterns (Figure 6A, yellow
arrowheads), suggesting that bulk endocytic uptake is normal in
tno1 roots.
To conﬁrm that bulk endocytosis was unaﬀected and that
endocytic vesicles are delivered normally to the TGN in the
mutant, the incorporation of FM4-64 into BFA bodies was
assessed. The fungal toxin BFA causes aggregation of the TGN
and TGN-derived endosomes to form BFA bodies (Geldner
et al., 2001; Dettmer et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2009). BFA
body formation is delayed in tno1 cotyledons but occurs at
similar rates in root cells of WT and tno1 mutants (Kim and
Bassham, 2011). It was hypothesized that if tno1 has defects in
the delivery of endocytosed material to the TGN, then FM4-
64 labeling of BFA bodies in tno1 roots would be reduced
compared with WT roots. To test this hypothesis, 5-day-old
FIGURE 6 | tno1 mutants have normal bulk endocytosis and arrival of

followed by a 10 min incubation with 4 µM FM4-64, showing arrival of

WT and mutant seedlings were incubated with 35 µM BFA
for an hour to allow formation of BFA bodies. They were
then stained with 4 µM FM4-64 for 10 min in the presence
of BFA, followed by two washes in MS medium containing
BFA. The BFA bodies in both WT and tno1 roots showed
normal FM4-64 staining (Figure 6B, white arrowheads) after
10 min. Thus, loss of TNO1 does not aﬀect bulk endocytosis and
membrane ﬂow from the plasma membrane to the TGN in root
cells.
DISCUSSION
Auxin ﬂow in plants is an important determinant of root
architecture and tropic bending such as gravitropism. The polar
transport of auxin depends on the speciﬁc localization of auxin
transporters, which in turn is dependent on the cellular traﬃcking
machinery. The TGN is an important organelle controlling
vesicle traﬃcking, with the presence of multiple proteins that
aid the traﬃcking of cargoes such as auxin transporters. In this
study we have demonstrated a role for a putative tethering factor
localized at the TGN in eﬃcient gravitropic bending and LR
emergence, possibly by aﬀecting auxin transport.
TNO1 may Regulate Gravitropic
Responses through Trafﬁcking of Auxin
Transporters
Auxin ﬂows in a polar manner from the shoot to the root tip, via
the vasculature, and then back through the cortical and epidermal
cell layers shootward. This polar transport is dependent on the
polar localization of auxin transporters to plasma membranes, via
traﬃcking pathways that achieve correct subcellular distribution
(Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008). Auxin transporters undergo
endocytic recycling from the plasma membrane as well as being
targeted to new plasma membrane domains via the TGN (Kleine-
Vehn and Friml, 2008). This enables a plant to respond to
environmental cues and adjust its growth pattern accordingly.
For example, during the bending of roots upon gravistimulation,
an accumulation of auxin in the epidermal layer of the elongation
zone in the lower half of the root is required to facilitate the
bending process (Tanaka et al., 2006; Peer et al., 2011). This
occurs by the relocalization of auxin transporters, AUX1 in
the columella and lateral rootcap and AUX1 and PIN2 in the
epidermal cells (Strohm et al., 2012). The resulting readjustment
of auxin ﬂow from the columella via the lateral rootcap cell
to the epidermal cells in the root elongation zone leads to
diﬀerential growth (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Since tno1 has
defects in intracellular traﬃcking and TGN dynamics (Kim and
Bassham, 2011), we hypothesize that these may hinder auxin
transport pathways due to change(s) in traﬃcking of auxin
transporter(s).
Phenotypic characterization of gravitropic responses in tno1
roots and hypocotyls showed that these mutants have a decreased
angle of bending upon gravistimulation. Pharmacological studies
with auxin transport inhibitors and exogenous auxin analogs
suggest that altered auxin pathways are likely to be the underlying
cause of this defect. The gravitropic bending defect in tno1

TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence
roots and hypocotyls can be rescued by exogenous application
of 1-NAA and IAA, perhaps by overriding endogenous auxin
levels and routes of polar auxin transport, thus restoring auxin
responses. Growth of tno1 roots is hypersensitive to 2,4-D
and IAA but not to the eﬄux-speciﬁc substrate 1-NAA or
the eﬄux blocker NPA, raising the possibility that the auxin
inﬂux pathway might be defective while auxin eﬄux is normal.
Although blocking auxin inﬂux with 1-NOA does not result in
large diﬀerences in root elongation between the tno1 mutant
and WT, the sensitivity to 2,4-D in the presence of 1-NOA
is still higher for the tno1 mutant roots than the WT and
complemented lines. This, coupled with the inability of 2,4-D to
rescue the gravitropic bending defect of mutant hypocotyls, may
suggest altered responses to the inﬂux-speciﬁc substrate 2,4-D.
Additionally, the delayed progression of DR5rev:GFP expression
in epidermal cells of gravistimulated tno1 roots compared to
WT roots suggests that auxin ﬂow from the columella to the
epidermis (via the lateral rootcap cells) may be reduced in
tno1 roots. Based on these results, we hypothesize that altered
auxin inﬂux capacity underlies the gravitropic defects in tno1.
Given the role of TNO1, this could occur through altered
traﬃcking of auxin inﬂux carrier(s). However, it is also possible
that the sensitivity to 2,4-D in the tno1 mutant is due to
diﬀerences in auxin signaling, feedback or response, since it
is known that the auxin sensing mechanism is complex and
varies for diﬀerent kinds of auxins (Calderón Villalobos et al.,
2012).
Since auxin transporters are traﬃcked via endocytosis (Kleine-
Vehn and Friml, 2008), we hypothesized that TNO1 may aﬀect
endocytosis from the plasma membrane to the TGN/early
endosomes and hence alter transporter traﬃcking dynamics.
Bulk uptake and arrival of a general endocytosis marker at
the TGN was unaﬀected in the tno1 mutant and thus the
auxin-related defects do not appear to be due to defects
in bulk endocytosis. However, it is possible that TNO1 is
required for the polar targeting of a particular subset of
auxin transporter(s), either as they are newly synthesized
or during the recycling process for membrane relocalization.
Further detailed characterization of the behavior of such
proteins in tno1 cells will help distinguish between these
hypotheses.
The polar sorting of auxin transporters in plant cells is
highly complex and our understanding of how the SNARE
machinery might regulate this polarity is incomplete. Vacuolar
SNAREs have been shown to play a role in maintaining
auxin maxima and localization of the auxin eﬄux carrier
PIN1
in
the
leaf
primordium,
thereby
regulating
leaf
vasculature (Shirakawa et al., 2009). The SYP4 family of Qa
SNAREs aﬀects auxin distribution, root gravitropism, and
the intracellular traﬃcking of the PIN2 transporter to the
vacuole for degradation (Uemura et al., 2012). Since TNO1
associates with the SNARE machinery at the TGN, and its loss
causes a mis-localization of SYP61 as well as vacuolar sorting
defects (Kim and Bassham, 2011), the SYP41/SYP61/VTI12
complex in conjunction with TNO1 may regulate auxin
transport
by
aﬀecting
auxin
transporter

and
turnover.
TNO1 Contributes to the Temporal
Control of LR Emergence
We have demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in LR emergence
and generation of auxin response asymmetry in an emerging
LR. LR development begins by division of LR founder cells
(single or pairs of pericycle cells facing the xylem poles) in the
primary root and subsequent formation of an auxin maximum
and increased auxin responsiveness of the founder cells (De
Smet et al., 2007; Dubrovsky et al., 2008; Peret et al., 2009).
Auxin transport plays a crucial role in LR emergence, with
both auxin inﬂux and eﬄux carriers being involved. The auxin
inﬂux carrier AUX1 is important for loading auxin into the
vascular system (Marchant et al., 2002) and aux1 mutants have an
almost 50% reduction in LR number. Auxin in the endodermis
and cortical cells induces another auxin inﬂux carrier, LAX3,
which also facilitates LR emergence (Swarup et al., 2008). The
concerted action of AUX1 and LAX3, with subsequent induction
of expression of PIN3 in the cortex, leads to emergence of the
LR from the primary root (Swarup and Peret, 2012; Peret et al.,
2013).
The LR emergence defects observed in tno1 are consistent with
altered auxin transport due to disruption in the traﬃcking or
targeting of auxin transporters. tno1 mutants have a signiﬁcantly
reduced percentage (40% vs. 80% in WT) of emergent Stage II LRs
with asymmetric DR5rev:GFP expression, raising the possibility
of auxin transport defect(s). Since the action of PIN transporters
plays a crucial role in establishing this asymmetric pattern of
auxin activity in emergent LRs (Rosquete et al., 2013), TNO1
might aﬀect the traﬃcking of PIN transporters in the LR tip cells
during this process.
LR emergence occurs within the pericycle and involves
degradation of the pectin-rich middle lamella, with subsequent
cell separation to allow growth of the LR through multiple
cell layers (Vilches-Barro and Maizel, 2014). Focused auxin
ﬂow via transporters into the cortex and the epidermis causes
an induction of expression of cell wall remodeling enzymes
(Swarup et al., 2008; Peret et al., 2013). Secretory cargo, including
various cell wall remodeling enzymes, traﬃcs via the Golgi and
TGN toward the extracellular space (Foresti and Denecke, 2008;
Toyooka et al., 2009; De Caroli et al., 2011), in a pathway
potentially mediated by SYP61 (Drakakaki et al., 2012). Hence, it
is possible that defects in the TGN, including the mis-localization
of SYP61 seen in tno1, could also lead to disrupted secretion
of cell wall remodeling enzymes, thus leading to slower LR
emergence (Worden et al., 2012).
The
identiﬁcation
of eﬀectors

TNO1 may help elucidate its mechanism of action during
these auxin-mediated processes. Since tethering factors can
interact with Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007), TNO1 could
