Abstract: Efforts to understand the impact of spaceﬂight on the human body stem from growing
interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation,
including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the
changes in gene expression after spaceﬂight. However, little is known about the impact of long-
term spaceﬂight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes
in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice ﬂown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days.
RNA was isolated from the hearts of three ﬂight and three comparable ground control mice and
RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were signiﬁcantly
regulated after spaceﬂight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted
to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated,
but no signiﬁcant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative
stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence,
and a signiﬁcant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to
cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceﬂight, suggesting that cardiovascular
transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceﬂight.

1. Introduction
The historic Apollo 11 mission to the moon stimulated a shift into a new era of research,
merging biology and aerospace in an effort to achieve a greater understanding of the impact
of spaceﬂight on the human body. Microgravity at low earth orbit (LEO), experienced
aboard the International Space Station (ISS), causes changes in gravity-dependent ﬂuid
ﬂow within the cardiovascular system [1–3]. Changes in cardiac output, heart rate and
rhythm, blood pressure, and heart morphology have been reported following exposure to
the spaceﬂight environment [4–6]. The low-dose radiation environment in space can also
initiate structural damage at the DNA, cellular, and organ levels [2].
Ongoing studies using multi-omics suggest that the impact of spaceﬂight appears to
vary depending on the model, the organ system, the differentiation status of the cells, and
the length of spaceﬂight exposure [7,8]. Studies focused on the cardiovascular system have
shown that human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs)
cultured on the International Space Station (ISS) responded to the spaceﬂight environment
by altering the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function [9]. In the cardiac
tissue of mice, transcriptional changes induced after 15 days in space include the differential
expression of genes related to the cell cycle, senescence, and redox balance [10]. Cardiac

remodeling and alterations in the expression of proteasome and extracellular matrix genes
occurred in the hearts of Drosophila after 30 days in spaceﬂight [11]. Little is known,
however, about transcriptomic changes in mammalian hearts in vivo following 30 days of
spaceﬂight. A better understanding of transcriptomic changes within the intact heart in
space is important for long-term missions planned for the future. In this study, we provide
a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression changes in the mouse heart after 30 days on
the ISS.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Flight and Control Conditions
Female C57BL/6J mice aged 8–9 weeks old were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were shipped to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Space Life Sciences
Laboratory (SLSL). Although there were several groups in this study, this report focuses on the
transcriptomic changes in the heart when mice are housed in the spaceflight environment for
30 days. Mice were acclimatized for 1–2 weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Their living
conditions were controlled for temperature and humidity and included a 12:12 h light–dark
cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. During this adaptation period, the mice
were adapted to the flight hardware (Rodent Research Hardware System). Mice flown on
the International Space Station (ISS) and comparable ground control mice were maintained
under identical conditions, including a single injection of saline. At 30 days, flight mice
were transferred into the ISS Microgravity Sciences Glovebox (MSG), were euthanized via
intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia followed by
closed-cardiac puncture exsanguination and cervical dislocation. After removal of the spleen,
mice were wrapped in foil, frozen and stored in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS
(MELFI) at −96 ◦C until sample return. NASA GLACIER and Cold Bag lockers were used to
transport samples back to the ground following mission completion.
2.2. Tissue Collection and RNA Extraction for Sequencing
The frozen ground control and spaceﬂight mice were slightly thawed, dissected on ice,
and the inferior two-thirds of the hearts were extracted. Cardiac tissue sections were stored
in RNALater, RNAProtect, or were ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNAProtect samples
were stored at −20 ◦C. The RNALater and ﬂash-frozen samples were stored at −80 ◦C.
RNA was isolated from the hearts of three mice ﬂown on the ISS and three hearts from
comparable hardware- and age-matched ground control mice. The extraction of RNA from
cardiac tissue was conducted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 25 mg of cardiac tissue was homogenized
with QIAzol (Qiagen) and centrifuged. The aqueous layer was extracted, and then ﬁltered
using RNeasy Mini Spin columns provided in the kit. RNA was eluted using 30 µL of
RNase-free water. RNA quality was assessed using nanodrop and gel electrophoresis, and
RIN >8 was veriﬁed prior to sequencing.
2.3. RNA Sequencing and Analysis
Poly(A) RNA sequencing was performed by LC Sciences (Houston, Texas) using RNA
from three ground control mice and three spaceflight mice. The Poly(A) sequencing library
was prepared using Illumina’s TrueSeq-stranded-mRNA sample preparation protocol. An
Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer was utilized to validate RNA integrity. An Agilent
Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip was used to conduct quality
control analyses and quantification of the sequencing library. Paired-end sequencing was per-
formed on an Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000 system. To conduct transcript assembly, Cutadapt [12]
and perl scripts in house were used to remove reads with adaptor contamination, low-
quality bases, and undetermined bases. Sequence quality was verified using FastQC (http://
www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) version 0.10.1 (accessed on 1 Septem-
ber 2022). HISAT2 was utilized to map the genome of ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-
101/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/ v101 (accessed on 1 September 2022), while StringTie was

used for transcript assembly [13,14]. The comprehensive transcriptome was generated
from merged transcriptomes via perl scripts and gffcompare (https://github.com/gpertea/
gffcompare/) (accessed on 1 September 2022). To conduct mRNA expression profiling, LC
Sciences utilized StringTie and Ballgown (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/
bioc/html/ballgown.html) (accessed on 1 September 2022) [14]. StringTie specifically was
used to calculate FPKM [14]. R package DESeq and edgeR were used to determine differen-
tially expressed mRNAs [15,16]. A p-value of 0.05 and a fold change cutoff of 2 were chosen
for this analysis. This subsequent data was analyzed u\sing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
(Qiagen, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis), (ac-
cessed 27 October 2022) [17]. RNA sequencing data was additionally uploaded to STRING
and David Gene Ontology to determine significantly affected pathways and functions [18–20].
3. Results
3.1. Cardiac Transcriptome Alterations Induced by 30 Days in Spaceﬂight
KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) scatterplots were generated based on the top one
hundred signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) expressed genes and transcripts in the spaceﬂight group
(Figure 1a–c). Genes that function within the cAMP, cGMP-PKG, and calcium signaling
pathways contributing to cell proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and survival were
identiﬁed as enriched (Figure 1b). Spaceﬂight signiﬁcantly altered the expression of Adcy9,
Atp2a1, Adrb3, Nppa, Myl9, Adcy9, Grin2c, Ptgfr, Atp2a1, and Adrb3 in the cGMP-PKG
and calcium signaling pathways. In the cAMP signaling pathway, ﬁve of six genes were
downregulated, including Grin2c, Drd2, Nppa, Ppp1r1b, and Myl9, while Adcy9 was
upregulated. This effect might be explained by the downregulation of Nppa expression.
Nppa is an upstream regulator of Adcy9. GO analyses indicated that spaceﬂight has an
impact on several molecular functions and biological processes (Figure 1c). A total of 1147
signiﬁcantly regulated transcripts included 514 transcripts that were classiﬁed as upregu-
lated (45%) and 633 transcripts that were downregulated (55%) in spaceﬂight (Figure 1d).
The upregulated transcripts play a role in calcium, protein kinase A, ERK-MAPK, PI3K-Akt,
senescence, cell cycle, and cAMP-mediated signaling. DAVID GO identiﬁed the cAMP
signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton
in the top ten most prevalent KEGG pathways from the 633 downregulated transcripts.
The top 100 most signiﬁcant alterations in the transcriptome induced by spaceﬂight
are shown in the heatmap (Figure 1e). The group of uniformly downregulated transcripts
in the spaceﬂight group, namely transcripts Rps5 through Nedd4l, have enzymatic func-
tions and roles in transcriptional regulation. Some were identiﬁed as ribosomal proteins.
Similarly, in the group of uniformly upregulated transcripts, namely Ythdc1 through Iﬁ47,
11 transcripts contribute to cell survival and 10 transcripts have functional roles in cellular
development, molecular transport, and protein trafﬁcking. This upregulated transcript
group is involved in cell-cycle checkpoint regulation, cellular assembly and organization,
cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, p53 signaling, and cell survival. Within this large
group of uniformly upregulated transcripts, Ric8b, Synpo2, Pik3cd, and E2f3 were of par-
ticular interest because they regulate the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cellular proliferation,
the GPCR signaling pathway, and cell migration, respectively. From these top one hundred
signiﬁcant transcripts, a canonical pathway map was created to depict the most prevalent
cellular signaling pathways. The cellular processes shown include the senescence pathway,
PI3K-Akt signaling, p53 signaling, and E2F signaling (Figure 1f). The cellular processes
most affected by stressful conditions in spaceﬂight are those that contribute to cellular
maintenance and survival.

3.2. MAPK Signaling Is Activated by Spaceﬂight
Signaling pathways that impact cytoskeletal arrangement, CREB signaling, stress,
cardiac hypertrophy, senescence, and other pathways involve MAPK signaling. The MAPK
signaling pathway (also known as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway or MAPKKK pathway)
is a highly complex signaling cascade that involves six groups. Four subfamilies are the
most well-known and include extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2
terminal kinases (JNK1,−2,−3), p38 kinase, and MAPK (BMK/ERK5). This signaling
pathway is activated through signal transduction from integrins and cell surface receptors,
such as receptor tyrosine kinases and/or G-protein-coupled receptors.
One of the top three canonical pathways generated in IPA with a positive z-score
was the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 2a). ERK pathway activation involves
the phosphorylation of p44 MAPK and p42 MAPK, also known as ERK1 and ERK2, ERK
translocation to the nucleus, and the activation of several transcription factors. These
transcription factors alter gene expression to promote growth, differentiation, and /or
mitosis. As shown in Figure 2a, the upregulation of ERK1/2 and the inhibition of SOS
and BAD are predicted to prevent apoptosis. Several transcripts induced by spaceﬂight
and identiﬁed by IPA as signiﬁcant (p-value 3.63 ×10−3) are shown in the heatmaps
(Figure 2b,c).
Twenty-three transcripts related to the MAPK pathway were significantly induced. All
twenty-three transcripts ranging from the lowest to highest level of expression are shown
in Figure 2d,e. Seven transcripts were elevated within the range of 2 to ~50 fold (p < 0.001)
(Figure 2d). Five of these seven transcripts regulate angiogenesis, proliferation, and play
a role in preventing apoptosis. The final two transcripts, Plce1 and Rasgrf2, are involved
in GTPase activity and calcium-regulated nucleotide exchange and were induced by 22 to
48 fold over transcript levels expressed in ground control mice. As shown in Figure 2e, the
remaining 16 transcripts were also upregulated significantly. These transcripts were induced
by 700 to 26,000+ fold, (p < 0.001). The most highly expressed transcripts are involved in
signal transduction, mediating cell responses to proinflammatory cytokines, environmental
stresses, ion channel subunits, serine/threonine-protein kinases, and protein phosphatases.
The genes encoding these transcripts include Ppp5c, Rps6ka4, Map2k7, and Cacna1c.
3.3. Spaceﬂight Modiﬁes Actin but Has Limited Effect on the ECM in the Heart
All signiﬁcantly regulated transcripts were uploaded to DAVID Gene Ontology
(DAVID GO) for functional enrichment and annotation analyses. Transcripts associated
with the cytoskeleton (p = 1.0 ×10−7, Benjamini = 1.5 ×10−5) were signiﬁcantly altered
when comparing the spaceﬂight and control groups. To determine which aspects of the
cytoskeleton were most heavily affected, 159 signiﬁcant cytoskeleton-related transcripts
were selected for target analyses. In total, 86 transcripts (54%) were downregulated and
73 transcripts (46%) were upregulated, shown in green and red, respectively (Figure 3a).
The most signiﬁcant ﬁnding from the KEGG analyses of this subset was regulation of
the actin cytoskeleton (p = 8.8 ×10−15, Benjamini = 1.6 ×10−12). This information was
used to generate a pathway demonstrating the dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton
(Figure 3b). Actin stabilization, actin polymerization, actomyosin assembly, and focal
adhesion were all associated with downregulated transcripts, indicating a potential inhibi-
tion of these functions. The upregulation of PAK activates MAPK. Despite the signiﬁcant
dysregulation of the cytoskeleton, the evaluation of prominent extracellular matrix (ECM)
components revealed that only 2 of 50 transcripts were altered (Figure 3c). Speciﬁcally, one
collagen transcript, col4a5, was downregulated and one integrin, Itgb1, was upregulated.
This reveals a predominantly unaltered transcriptome of products associated with ECM.
Thrombospondins, ﬁbronectin, vitronectin, and dystroglycan were also not altered by
spaceﬂight in this model. To address the potential functional impact of all ECM transcripts
that were affected, 37 signiﬁcantly modulated ECM products were uploaded to DAVID GO.
This allowed us to generate an ECM–receptor interaction chart based on KEGG analyses
(Figure 3d). Collagen dysregulation has the potential to affect integrins involved with VLA

proteins and proteoglycans. FRAS1 and agrin are of interest in multiple contexts as both
play roles in organ development; however, in the context of ECM receptor binding, the
downregulation of these transcripts can impact integrins and glycoproteins.

Figure 3. Spaceﬂight modiﬁes actin but has limited effect on the ECM in the heart. (a) A total of
155 signiﬁcantly modulated cytoskeleton-related transcripts were selected from the original transcript
data received from LC Sciences. Of this subset, 86 were upregulated and 73 were downregulated.
(b) This dataset was uploaded to DAVID Gene Ontology for subset analyses. The most signiﬁcant
KEGG analysis demonstrated there was regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in spaceﬂight with a
downregulation of the products involved in focal adhesion, actin stabilization, actin polymerization,
and actomyosin assembly (p = 8.8 ×10−15, Benjaminini = 1.6 ×10−12); (c) ECM components were
analyzed for any changes induced by spaceﬂight, namely collagens, integrins, laminins, and elastin.
Of these components, only two transcripts were signiﬁcantly altered out of 50; (d) 37 signiﬁcantly
altered ECM-related transcripts were uploaded to DAVID GO for targeted analyses. KEGG analyses
of ECM-binding products demonstrated limited interaction. FRAS1, collagen, and agrin were
signiﬁcantly downregulated and integrin beta 1 was signiﬁcantly upregulated. Figures (b,d) were
created using BioRender.com (accessed on 15 December 2022).

3.4. The PI3K-Akt Pathway Is Induced by Spaceﬂight
The PI3K-Akt pathway is one of the top ﬁve canonical pathways impacted by space-
ﬂight with a p-value of 6.21 × 10−3. DAVID GO identiﬁed 18 genes associated with this
pathway (Benjamini 1.8 × 10−22), where Mdm2, Tsc1, Hras, and Pik3cd transcripts were
signiﬁcantly elevated in expression with a fold change ranging from 3–13,830 (p < 0.001)
(Figure 4a,b). Hras is an upstream promoter of Pik3cd, a component of the PI3K complex,
which leads to the activation of cell survival, cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation, and
protein synthesis (Figure 4c). G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling was revealed
as a signiﬁcant canonical pathway (p-value = 1.22 × 10−6). Transcripts associated with
GPCR signaling were induced by spaceﬂight, including P2ry1, Hras, Rapgef3, Plce1, Pik3cd,
Prkacb, Atf2, Pde4c, Creb5, Camk2b, Lpar1, and Adcy7. These transcripts were upregulated
in space, ranging from 2–7631 fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 4d,e). Multiple pathways downstream
of GPCR signaling were activated or predicted to be activated by spaceﬂight (Figure 4f).
These downstream pathways included YAP/TAZ, NFkB, AKT, IP3, DAG, MAPK, STAT3,
CREB, RAS, and mTOR. The pathways predicted to be activated promote cell survival,
proliferation, and enhance cellular response to oxidative stress (Figure 4f).
3.5. The Spaceﬂight Environment Activates Transcripts Associated with the Cell Cycle
Transcriptomic analyses comparing cardiac tissue samples collected from the space
mice and the control mice maintained on the ground revealed elevated transcripts as-
sociated with the activation of the cell cycle in space. A fold change cutoff of 2.0 was
applied to differentially expressed transcripts, resulting in the identiﬁcation of thirty-one
statistically signiﬁcant transcripts that were found to be elevated. The fold changes ranged
from 3 to over 6000 fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 5a,b). In murine embryonic stem cells, Cdk2ap2
is a regulator of cell renewal and is essential for survival during differentiation [21]. Pak4
plays a role in proliferation, cell migration, adhesion, and survival [22]. Phf8 regulates tran-
scription factors necessary for cell-cycle progression and a lack of this transcript results in a
prolonged G2 phase before mitosis [23]. The transcript with the highest fold change was
Jade1, which activates transcription through the process of histone acetylation. Although
the speciﬁc transcript encoding Jade1 has not been previously studied in the spaceﬂight
environment, prior publications have reported that histone acetylation increases in mi-
crogravity [24,25]. A heatmap comparing the expression levels of transcripts associated
with cell-cycle activation on the ground and in space is shown in Figure 5c. Figure 5d
shows the network of interaction that ties the signiﬁcantly elevated transcripts together.
Hras and Mdm2 both activate and are activated by multiple transcripts. Hras activates cell
progression and Mdm2 is known to induce proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [26,27]. The
microgravitational environment enhances cell-cycle progression, coupled with cell survival
in the cardiovascular system of mice.
3.6. Transcripts Associated with Cellular Senescence Are Not Signiﬁcantly Elevated in the Heart
Microgravity does not promote cellular senescence in the heart of space mice after long-
term exposure. Figure 6a shows a pathway for cellular senescence that was created through
IPA, comparing mice maintained on the ground and mice housed in space. Differential
transcript expression values were uploaded to the IPA database for all signiﬁcant genes
related to the cell cycle. Using that analysis, a pathway was created to predict cellular
senescence where reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to oxidative stress, which causes
DNA damage. According to IPA, ROS and oxidative stress molecules show low levels of
predicted activation and DNA damage is not predicted. Ras activation, however, stimulates
PI3k and MAPK. The downstream effect of this is the inactivation of senescence. Twenty-
four transcripts related to senescence were analyzed (Figure 6b), of which only four were
signiﬁcantly altered by spaceﬂight, including Pak4, which was upregulated and functions
to activate pro-survival pathways [22].

3.7. Oxidative Stress in the Heart
Most transcripts associated with oxidative stress were not signiﬁcantly altered in the
hearts of mice ﬂown on the ISS for 30 days. As shown in Table 1, the fold change in the
expression of 21 genes related to oxidative stress ranged from 0.22–1.62, with no signiﬁ-
cant difference in expression when comparing the ground control mice to the space mice
(p > 0.05). A list of 126 transcripts associated with oxidative stress was created. The change
in expression when comparing ﬂight and ground conditions was only signiﬁcant in seven of
these genes (p ≤0.0005). The variants that were signiﬁcant included 1600014C10Rik, Etfdh,
Gpx1, and Ndufs2, which were upregulated, and Sirt1, Slc7a11, and Tor1a, which were
downregulated. The expression of the remaining 119 genes in this group was unchanged
as demonstrated in Figure 7.

data. Of these transcripts, only 4 variants were signiﬁcant, with only 3 inducing senescence. Figure

signiﬁcantly impacted by spaceﬂight (p ≤0.0005).

4. Discussion
The increasing interest in space exploration and long-term spaceﬂight requires a better
understanding of the reactive and adaptive changes that occur in various organ systems
after exposure to the unique conditions of the space environment. Microgravity and
radiation are known to induce alterations in gene expression; however, limited information
has been reported deﬁning the transcriptomic changes that impact organ system functions.
This report provides a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression changes that occur in
the mouse heart after 30 days of spaceﬂight aboard the ISS. To our knowledge, this study
is one of the ﬁrst to use an in vivo model to focus on the effects of long-term (30 day)
spaceﬂight on gene expression, molecular pathways, and cellular changes occurring in
the heart. Several signaling pathways and cellular processes were altered in a manner
suggestive of cellular adaptation through mechanisms that promote survival.
The cytoskeleton adjusts to microgravity in a manner which follows the cellular tenseg-
rity model [28], which purports the concept that gravitational change breaks the tension
load on cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins, consequently triggering reorganiza-
tion [29]. Our studies on the mouse heart demonstrate that cytoskeleton breakdown and
reorganization occur. We identiﬁed 83 transcripts that were signiﬁcantly downregulated
and 76 transcripts that were signiﬁcantly upregulated, including integrins beta-1 (trans-
membrane proteins attaching the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix). Cytoskeletal
changes may also be inﬂuenced by trophic changes in cardiomyocytes, affecting tension

and load bearing. These alterations impact MAPK signaling pathways. Further studies
conducted during extended periods of spaceﬂight (e.g., 6 months) are needed to determine
whether cytoskeletal reorganization reaches an optimal point for cellular functioning. Inter-
estingly, our model showed limited changes to the major components of the extracellular
matrix, although the ECM undergoes modiﬁcations in spaceﬂight in the mouse lung and
drosophila heart [11,30]. The impact of spaceﬂight on the ECM may differ according to
organ, species, or length of exposure. An open versus closed cardiac system may result in
signiﬁcantly different adaptive responses.
Transcriptomic analyses reveal active cell proliferation linked to cell-cycle regulation.
Known cell-cycle markers indicate that cells divide and survive in the heart. Recent
studies show the enhanced proliferation of immune cells in mice undergoing microgravity
exposure [31]. Inﬁltrating immune cells or endothelial cell activation may be contributing
factors [32]. Enhanced proliferation could lead to cytoskeletal adaptations in spaceﬂight
mice. Macrophages exhibit structural changes in their cytoskeletal arrangement, speciﬁcally
impacting actin in response to microgravity [33].
MAPK signaling plays an essential role in cell-cycle activation, cell growth, differenti-
ation, development, and survival [34,35]. MAPK signaling was predicted to be induced
by spaceﬂight in the mouse heart. Prior studies using isolated cells ﬂown on the ISS for
4–5 days reported an increased expression of small GTPases, Ras, and Rho, which coincides
with our transcriptome results [36]. Ras/MAPK regulates stress signal responses and
consequently elevates antioxidant transcripts [37]. Prxl2c transcripts were elevated in our
ﬁndings, consistent with this interpretation. Peroxiredoxin-like 2C (Prxl2c) is predicted
to enable antioxidant activity and functions in the positive regulation of ERK1/2 and in
the regulation of glycolytic processes. MAPK has also been reported to be activated in the
mouse brain by microgravity [38].
The cytoprotective role of MAPK is one of the many downstream effects of GPCR and
PI3K pathway activation [34,39]. It is well understood that the activation of GPCR signaling
and the PI3K-AKT pathway leads to cellular survival, cell-cycle progression, and, more
specifically, cardiomyocyte survival and cardiovascular homeostasis [40–42]. Previous studies
in other models focusing on the role of PI3K in cardiac health have revealed the role of this
pathway in eliciting protective changes following physiological stress [42–46]. The impact
of spaceflight on this signaling pathway in a cardiac model in space, however, is not well
understood. Cultured cells exposed to spaceflight conditions have shown an increase in
G-protein alpha subunit activation and elevated MAPK signaling activity [36,47]. Under
short-term simulated microgravity conditions, decreased PI3K and AKT expression and
higher apoptotic rates were reported in cultured cells [48]. Detrimental physiological changes
have been associated with the downregulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [49]. Our
study revealed a significant upregulation of multiple transcripts that comprise the GPCR
and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in cardiac tissue following 30 days in space. Our findings
suggest that cellular survival and adaptation occur through the upregulation of the GPCR
and PI3K-Akt pathways as a response to long-term exposure to the space environment. The
activation of the GPCR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways may function in a protective capacity
during spaceflight to counter the effects of the physiologically stressful environment. To our
knowledge, little is known about the effect of the space environment on the GPCR and PI3K-
Akt signaling pathways in the cardiovascular system in live animals subjected to long-term
spaceflight. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular changes within the cardiovascular
system that allow for adaptation to the space environment are necessary to prepare for future
long-term space travel.
Surprisingly, oxidative stress was not signiﬁcantly induced in the heart at 30 days.
Mitochondria are the source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and microgravity has been
shown to activate its production. The imbalance of ROS versus the processes that prevent
oxidative stress can cause the mitochondria to become dysfunctional [50]. Most of the
transcripts involved in the regulation of oxidative stress were not affected in our model;
only 7 of 126 transcripts examined showed a signiﬁcant change in expression. Five of these

Biomolecules 2023, 13, 371

transcripts offered cell protection and only two were impacted in a manner that would be
expected to promote ROS production. These transcripts were Ndufs2, which forms part
of the core of NADH dehydrogenase complex I, and Etfdh, which is part of the electron
transport chain. Both have the potential to affect ROS levels in the mitochondria [51].
However, it is notable that although these signiﬁcant transcripts can increase ROS levels,
they may not be sufﬁcient independently. Because it is well accepted that microgravity can
increase the concentration of reactive oxygen species [52], it is possible that the oxidant
nature of ROS further activates Ras/MAPK cascades that respond to stress signals and
create a balanced system through the increased transcription of antioxidants [37]. This
could explain why a signiﬁcant upregulation of Gpx1 was noted in our study. Gpx1
increases glutathione levels to aid in oxidative defense [53]. In addition to activating the
antioxidative response, MAPK functions to induce cellular homeostasis in conjunction
with processes such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is known to regulate and
degrade proteins within the MAPK pathway [54]. The proteasome units, once activated, can
begin degrading not only the MAPK transcripts, but also the oxidized proteins which are
typically found in excess during oxidative stress [55]. Oxidative stress has been shown to
increase due to microgravity [52]. The ability to manage oxidative stress may be inﬂuenced
by the time of exposure or the organ system studied. Research on mice and mouse-derived
cells in spaceﬂight has often focused on organs other than the heart. This includes the
brain and skeletal system, although there was a recent publication that demonstrated select
genes associated with oxidative stress in the heart were elevated in shorter-term spaceﬂight
exposure [10,56,57]. Interestingly, the expression of these genes was not elevated at 30 days.
We speculate that our experimental data could be due to acclimatization in the heart during
the extended time mice were exposed to microgravity.
Cellular senescence may occur as a consequence of exposure to the stress of the
spaceﬂight environment. Senescence occurs when cells enter cell-cycle arrest [58]. Within
the mouse heart, our ﬁndings demonstrate that cell-cycle progression was not impeded by
spaceﬂight, oxidative stress was managed, and cellular senescence was not predicted to
occur by transcriptomic analyses. Stress mechanisms activate senescence, yet our data show
that transcriptomic changes associated with oxidative stress were not signiﬁcantly induced
after 30 days in space. This may, in part, explain why senescence was not predicted to be
activated in the heart. It is also possible that the young age of the mice utilized in our study
may have obscured senescence-related changes [59]. Spaceﬂight-related senescence may
be better observed in older mice. Additionally, our study was limited to the use of female
mice. In humans, female astronauts suffer different cardiac effects compared to their male
counterparts [60]. Studies planned for the future should be designed to include animals of
both sexes in order to determine whether sex-based disparities occur in responses to the
spaceﬂight environment. Sequential timepoint analyses would also be beneﬁcial in order
to provide insight regarding the ways in which the length of exposure to the spaceﬂight
environment inﬂuences adaptive and reactive changes in the heart.
Based on our findings, we propose that 30 days in spaceflight provides enough time for
the initiation of an adaptive response to the space environment to occur within the murine
heart. Out of 86,406 analyzed transcripts, only 1147 transcripts (1.3%) were significant in the
flight group, suggesting that by 30 days the heart has successfully adapted to the stressful space
conditions. Some cellular processes that may contribute to adaptation and survival are the
PI3K-Akt pathway, GPCR signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Transcriptomic
analyses predicted the activation of these pathways in the flight group. The ability of the heart
to adapt to the space environment after long-term spaceflight is one possible explanation for
the lack of differences in ROS and oxidative stress when comparing the flight and ground
control groups in our study. Additionally, over time, adaptation can shift the focus from
survival to growth, away from senescence, and towards cell proliferation. Survival in space
may be facilitated by the adaptive nature of the transcriptome.
