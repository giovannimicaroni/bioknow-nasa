Abstract: The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK) gene family is crucial to
various molecular and cellular processes in plants. We identified 50 PERK genes in Brassica
napus to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles.
These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromo-
somes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the
evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular
weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif
analyses revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine
kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis-element analysis predicted the
involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed
diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in
growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein–protein interaction networks suggested
BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple
biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon Plas-
modiophora brassicae infection implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the
Arabidopsis perk9 mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune
response, suggesting the negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity. The study highlighted
the potential role of BnPERKs in crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.

1. Introduction
Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) constitute the largest plant receptor family and are
located on the cell surface to perceive and transduce a wide range of signals [1]. By
initiating intracellular signaling cascades, RLKs play pivotal roles in various molecular and
cellular processes, including plant development, stress response, and signal transduction [2].
These versatile receptors are capable of sensing plant hormones, secreted peptides, and
molecules derived from pathogens involved in plant defense response [3]. For example,
RLKs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger the Pattern-
Triggered Immunity (PTI) response, activating signaling pathways that defend against
pathogen invasion.
RLKs typically consist of three key domains: an extracellular domain, a transmem-
brane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain [4]. The extracellular domain, character-
ized by significant structural diversity, forms the basis for classifying RLKs into different
subclasses based on their motif structures. Among these, the proline-rich extensin-like

receptor kinases (PERKs) represent a distinct group characterized by a proline-rich extra-
cellular domain [5]. Interestingly, while some PERKs like BnPERK1 and AtPERK4 locate on
the plasma membrane, AtPERK13 has been demonstrated to anchor to the cell wall [6–9].
Functionally, the intracellular kinase domain of RLKs contains conserved motifs that exhibit
kinase activity, which has been observed in BnPERK1 and AtPERK4 [7,10].
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the PERK gene family consists of 15 members, some of which
show specific expression patterns in roots and floral organs [11]. However, some AtPERK
genes exhibit broad expression patterns across various tissues, such as AtPERK1, which
is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting its involvement in diverse molecular and cellular
processes. Recent studies have elucidated the regulation of PERKs in response to different
stress conditions [5]. For example, the expression of TaPERKs in wheat and GhPERKs
in cotton is significantly influenced by abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, and salin-
ity [12,13]. In A. thaliana, AtPERK13 has been shown to respond to nutrient deficiencies such
as phosphate, nitrogen, and iron deprivation, highlighting the role of PERKs in maintaining
nutrient homeostasis and adaptation [9]. In rice, the PERK gene Z15 is activated by moder-
ately low temperatures, emphasizing the adaptability of PERKs to diverse environmental
cues [14]. Additionally, PERKs have been implicated in plant defense against pathogens.
For example, the expression of TaPERKs is influenced by fungal pathogens, and BnPERK1
has been shown to respond to the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum [7,12,15]. In summary,
PERKs are versatile players in response to various stresses.
PERKs also play essential roles in plant hormone signaling. Several studies have
highlighted the involvement of PERKs in the regulation of growth and development in
response to hormonal signals [10,13,16]. For instance, AtPERK4 has been implicated in
abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during root cell elongation [10]. Furthermore, the expression
profiles of OsPERKs and GhPERKs have shown differential expression patterns under
different plant hormone treatments, including ABA, methyl jasmona (MeJA), gibberellin
(GA), salicylic acid (SA), and auxin [13,16]. The intricate regulation of PERKs by different
plant hormones suggests their pivotal role in integrating hormonal signaling pathways to
coordinate plant growth and stress responses.
In summary, PERK genes are known to be critical to plant growth, development,
and stress responses. Despite the essential roles of PERKs in various processes across
various plant species, comprehensive studies on the PERK gene family in Brassica napus
(oilseed rape), an economically important crop serving as both an edible oil source and
animal feed, are still limited [17]. This allopolyploid species (AACC, 2n = 38), formed
by the hybridization between two diploid ancestors, B. rapa (AA = 20) and B. oleracea
(CC = 18), emerged approximately 6800 to 12,500 years ago [18]. While a comprehensive
study of BrPERK genes has been completed in male-sterile B. rapa plants, identifying
25 BrPERK genes and exploring their potential role in male sterility, studies in B. napus
remain scarce [19].
This study aimed to provide a comprehensive study of BnPERK genes to include the
exploration of its evolutionary history, chromosome location, and gene structure through
various computational approaches. Tissue-specific and hormone treatment gene expression
patterns were examined using available transcriptome datasets. Additionally, the study
also investigated the role of BnPERKs in response to the obligate pathogen Plasmodiophora
brassicae, which causes clubroot disease in Brassica species. By providing insights into the
molecular and functional roles of BnPERKs, this study will contribute to a deeper under-
standing of this often-overlooked plant receptor subfamily and its potential applications in
crop improvement.

2. Results
2.1. Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis of BnPERKs in Brassica napus
Fifty PERK genes were identified within the B. napus ‘ZS11’ genome (Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3). Identification was accomplished through an extensive BLAST search
using 15 AtPERK sequences, revealing a higher number of BnPERK genes compared with
those reported in Arabidopsis, Chinese cabbage, soybean, rice, sorghum, maize, cotton,
and wheat (Supplementary Table S4). The BnPERK family of proteins exhibited varying
lengths, ranging from 187 to 921 amino acids. Their molecular weights (MWs) spanned
from 20.63 to 102.21 kDa, with BnPERK15C2 and BnPERK15A2 representing the extremes.
Additionally, the isoelectric points (pIs) ranged from 5.26 to 8.59 (Supplementary Table S5).
The data plots illustrated that BnPERK proteins exhibit a broad spectrum of MW and pI.
Moreover, predictions of subcellular localization suggested that most BnPERK proteins
were located on the plasma membrane and endomembrane system, while others were
associated with the nucleus and chloroplast (Supplementary Table S5).
To investigate the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary relationships of the
PERK gene family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using 50 BnPERK protein sequences
and 15 AtPERK protein sequences by MEGA11 using the maximum likelihood (ML) method
(Supplementary Table S6). The BnPERK genes were categorized into four groups (I–IV)
based on sequence similarity and functional domain analysis. Group III, being the largest
group, included 5 paralogs with 24 BnPERK genes. Group I followed, containing 6 paralogs
with 21 BnPERK genes. Group II included 3 paralogs, with 3 BnPERK genes, while Group
IV contained only 1 paralog, with 3 BnPERK genes (Figure 1). All AtPERK genes, with the
exception of AtPERK2, exhibited a close syntenic association with the 50 BnPERK genes.
Most AtPERK genes corresponded to 2–6 orthologous genes in B. napus, each comprising
orthologous genes from both the A and C subgenomes of B. napus. Notably, AtPERK3 was
associated with a single ortholog, BnPERK03A1, as its counterpart in the C subgenome
appeared to have been lost. These results suggest that genome rearrangement and gene
loss occurred during the polyploidization of B. napus.
2.2. Chromosomal Distribution and Collinearity Analysis of BnPERK Genes
The 50 BnPERK genes were evenly distributed across the A and C subgenomes of B.
napus, with 25 genes in each (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S1). These genes were
dispersed among all chromosomes, except for A10. The highest concentration of genes was
on the chromosome A1, which harbored seven genes, followed by six genes on C6 and five
genes on A7. Single BnPERK genes were identified on chromosomes A2, A3, A4, A5, C4,
and C9. The results indicated an irregular arrangement of the PERK gene family across the
rapeseed chromosomes (Figure 2).
The collinear gene pairs in the B. napus genome were analyzed to explore syntenic
relationships among BnPERKs (Figure 2). We identified 81 collinear gene pairs, including
49 pairs resulting from segmental duplication between the A and C subgenomes and
32 pairs occurring within a subgenome. The result indicated a high conservation between
the A and C subgenomes. Additionally, we assessed the selective pressure exerted on
duplicated BnPERK genes by calculating the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous
substitutions (Ka/Ks) for the paralogous gene pairs (Supplementary Table S7). The Ka/Ks
ratios ranged from 0.1409 to 0.2518 for 17 gene pairs in the A subgenome and from 0.1682
to 0.2519 for 15 gene pairs in the C subgenome. Furthermore, the Ka/Ks ratios for 49 gene
pairs between the A and C subgenomes varied from 0.0482 to 0.5148. Notably, the Ka/Ks
ratios for all paralogous gene pairs were found to be less than 1, indicating purifying
selection acting on BnPERK genes.

was constructed with 50 BnPERK protein sequences and 15 AtPERK protein sequences by MEGA11
using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. A total of 15 paralogs were identified, grouped into
15 distinct clusters, each represented by a different color (PERK1 to PERK15). Based on sequence
similarity and functional domain analysis, the 15 paralogs were further categorized into four major
groups, which are indicated by distinct colors (outer lane). Group I, light steel blue; Group II,
cornflower blue; Group III, royal blue; Group IV, black.
2.3. Gene Structure, Conserved Motifs, and Cis-Elements Analysis of BnPERK Genes
To elucidate the functional characteristics of BnPERKs, the conserved motif, pro-
tein domain, and exon–intron organization were analyzed together with the phyloge-
netic tree (Figure 3). Ten conserved motifs were identified across the BnPERK proteins
(Figures 3A and S2). These motifs exhibited consistent distribution patterns within the
BnPERK proteins, with the exceptions of BnPERK15C2, BnPERK15A1, BnPERK15A3, and
BnPERK10C1. Moreover, all BnPERK genes shared conserved tyrosine kinase domains,
highlighting their functional significance (Figure 3B). Exon–intron analysis revealed struc-
tural diversity within the BnPERK gene family, though orthologous genes generally shared
similar gene structures (Figure 3C). Most BnPERK genes harbored 5–9 introns, with the
number of introns ranging from 3 (BnPERK15C2) to 16 (BnPERK15A2).

of all the chromosomal BnPERK genes are shown in different chromosomes. The light green boxes
stand for A subgenomes and dark green boxes stand for C subgenomes in Brassica napus. The light
brown lines represent collinearity in BnPERK gene pairs.
Cis-elements analysis is crucial for understanding gene regulation and function. Ac-
cordingly, upstream 2 kb sequences from BnPERKs transcription start sites were analyzed
(Supplementary Tables S2 and S8). The results revealed that 75% of the identified cis-
elements were core promoter and enhancer region elements. The remaining cis-elements
were associated with hormonal responses, various stresses, and developmental processes
(Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S3). Cis-elements regulated responses to diverse
hormones, including methyl jasmona (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), auxin,
ethylene (ET), and salicylic acid (SA), which were calculated (Figure 4B). The ABA and
MeJA responsive elements were abundantly detected, and the auxin responsive elements
were secondarily enriched (Figure 4B). These cis-elements relate to various biotic and abi-
otic stresses, such as light, anaerobic conditions, drought, low temperature, defense, and
wounds (Figure 4C). Notably, there were light-responsive elements in all of the BnPERK
genes (Supplementary Figure S3). In addition, there was a small part of the cis-elements that
were categorized according to their roles in diverse developmental processes, including
zein metabolism, endosperm expression, meristem expression, cell cycle regulation, and
circadian control (Figure 4D). The presence of such diverse cis-elements suggests potential
regulatory roles of BnPERKs in diverse biological processes.

2.4. Expression Pattern of BnPERK Gene Family Across Various Tissues
The expression pattern of the BnPERK genes was analyzed across 14 tissues at various
developmental stages through RNA-Seq analysis (Figure 5). The results exhibited diverse
expression patterns across these tissues. There were 13 genes showing constitutive expres-
sion in multiple tissues, among which BnPERK01A1 and BnPERK01C1 exhibited the highest
expression levels. In contrast, certain genes displayed specific expression patterns. For
example, BnPERK03A1 showed highly specific but relatively low expression in the sepal,
and BnPERK15A3 specifically expressed in the leaf and silique. Moreover, 18 orthologous
genes of AtPERK5, AtPERK6, AtPERK7, and AtPERK12 in B. napus were highly expressed
in pollen. BnPERK15C2, which encoded the shortest protein, was not expressed in any
tissues, suggesting a potential loss of function. These differential expression patterns of
BnPERK genes point to their diverse roles in plant growth and development.

and enhancer regions, which are represented by different colors and further categorized.

heatmap shows the expression of 50 BnPERK genes across 14 different tissues, processed with
log2 normalization. The color gradient ranges from blue (indicating lower expression levels) to red
(indicating higher expression levels), while the gray spots represent no detectable expression.
Furthermore, some paralogous gene pairs, such as BnPERK01A1/BnPERK01C1 and
BnPERK09A1/BnPERK09C1, showed similar expression patterns, being constitutively and
highly expressed across all tested tissues. In contrast, other paralogous gene pairs, like
BnPERK06A1/BnPERK06A2 and BnPERK06C1/BnPERK06C2, showed specific high expres-
sion in floral organs. Additionally, BnPERK15A4/BnPERK15C3 showed high expression
levels in different tissues, except for pollen. However, some paralogous gene pairs exhibited
distinct patterns, indicating functional divergence.

2.5. Expression Pattern of BnPERK Gene Family in Response to Hormone Treatments
In order to further explore the function of BnPERKs during hormone responses, we
investigated their expression patterns in both leaves and roots after different hormone treat-
ments (Figure 6). Among the 50 identified BnPERK genes, only a small subset was expressed
in leaves and roots. Most of these expressed genes were strongly induced in leaves within
0.5 h after indole acetic acid (IAA), l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC), gib-
berellin acid (GA), trans-zeatin (TZ), or brassinolide (BL) treatments (Figure 6A). Addition-
ally, four genes—BnPERK15A4, BnPERK15C3, BnPERK08A1, and BnPERK08C1—showed
enhanced transcript levels at different time points after methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment
in leaves. In contrast, their expression patterns in roots were distinct. Most genes showed
enhanced expression levels after GA and ABA treatments but decreased expression levels
after MeJA treatment (Figure 6B). Notably, BnPERK15A1 was strongly induced after MeJA
treatment. Furthermore, three genes, BnPERK09A1, BnPERK09C1, and BnPERK04C1, which
showed increased expression in leaves after IAA treatment, were also induced in roots.

heatmap displays the relative expression of BnPERKs at 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h after treatment, derived
from RNA-Seq analysis. IAA, indole acetic acid; GA, gibberellin acid; ABA, abscisic acid; ACC,
l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid; TZ, trans-zeatin; JA, methyl jasmonate; BL, brassinolide.
Different dot colors represent different relative expression levels: red dot indicates up-regulated
expression, blue dot indicates down-regulated expression, and the larger the dot, the greater the
fold change.
2.6. Protein–Protein Interaction Network Analysis of BnPERK Genes
Predictive interaction networks were employed to explore the biological mechanisms
of BnPERK proteins. The analysis revealed that the BnPERK proteins putatively interact
with 1133 proteins in B. napus. The results showed that most PERK proteins serve as
core nodes in these networks, interacting with various proteins participating in different
biological processes (Figure 7A and Supplementary Table S9).

proteins that interact with BnPERK proteins, and gray lines indicate the interaction between BnPERK
proteins and other proteins. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of proteins that interacted with BnPERK
proteins. (C) GO enrichment analysis of proteins that interacted with BnPERK proteins.
KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the interacting proteins were primarily
involved in processes such as pentose and glucuronate interconversions, plant–pathogen
interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, the biosynthesis
of secondary metabolites, endoplasmic reticulum processing, and the MAPK signaling
pathway (Figure 7B and Supplementary Table S10). Similarly, GO enrichment analysis
revealed significant enrichment of terms like integral components of the membrane and
plasma membrane in the cellular component category (Figure 7C and Supplementary
Table S11). ATP binding and kinase activity were prominently enriched in the molecular
function category. Biological process category terms such as protein phosphorylation,
pectin catalytic activity, and cell wall modification were enriched. Protein interactions
analysis provided a comprehensive view of the BnPERK proteins interaction network in
B. napus, underscoring their central role and broad involvement in different biological
processes, including sugar metabolism and plant–pathogen interaction.
2.7. Root Gall Formation and BnPERK Gene Expression in B. napus upon Plasmodiophora
brassicae Inoculation
Galls were observed on the roots of B. napus at 28 days after inoculation with P. brassicae
(Figure 8A). Cross-sections of the inoculated roots revealed the changes in the vascular
system. Resting spores that stained blue formed in the diseased roots. Furthermore,
diseased root cells exhibited hypertrophy and disorder, accompanied by thickened cell
walls, while control roots grew normally (Figure 8B). To better understand the response
of BnPERK genes to clubroot disease, we analyzed the expression of BnPERK at 14 days
after P. brassicae inoculation by RNA-Seq (Figure 8C). Among the 50 identified BnPERK

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 2685
10 of 19
genes, 23 were expressed in either inoculated or control roots. Notably, four genes, namely
BnPERK09A1, BnPERK09C1, BnPERK14A1, and BnPERK06C2, showed downregulated
expression in response to P. brassicae, among which BnPERK06C2 was completely inhibited
after inoculation. Additionally, the paralogous gene pair BnPERK09A1/BnPERK09C1 also
exhibited consistent expression patterns across different tissues. These four downregulated
BnPERK genes were implicated in the response to P. brassicae.

2.8. Function of AtPERK9 in Clubroot Disease
To explore the putative role of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 in clubroot disease,
the mutant of the orthologous gene AtPERK9 (At1g68690) was used for clubroot disease
investigation. Both the Col-0 and perk9 showed disease symptoms on the main roots and
the lateral roots (Figure 9A). The percentage of severely diseased plants (disease grade 3) in
Col-0 was much higher than that in perk9, which resulted in a significantly higher disease
index in Col-0 (Figure 9B,C). It indicated that perk9 showed decreased severity of the
clubroot disease.

phenotypes of wild-type A. thaliana (Col-0) and perk9 at 28 days after inoculation. (B) The occurrence of

index of Col-0 and perk9. (D) Expression patterns of PERK9, PR2, PR5, and RBOHD genes in Col-0
and perk9 lines. Different letters represent significant differences (p < 0.05).
Furthermore, the expression levels of PERK9, PR2, PR5, and RBOHD were evaluated
in Col-0 and perk9 lines at 14 days after P. brassicae inoculation. PERK9 also showed
downregulated expression in response to P. brassicae in Col-0, while it was totally inhibited
in perk9. The expressions of PR2, PR5, and RBOHD genes were greatly enhanced in perk9.
PR2 and RBOHD not only could be induced in Col-0 after P. brassicae inoculation, but also
in perk9. Enhanced disease resistance to clubroot disease and increased expression of these
genes in perk9 indicated that the basal immune response was triggered by the knockout
of PERK9.
3. Discussion
PERKs constitute a crucial subfamily of RLKs that play important roles in various
molecular and cellular processes in plants, including development, signaling, and stress

12 of 19
responses [5]. Despite their significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive study on
the molecular functions of PERKs, particularly when compared with other RLKs. While
genome-wide analyses of PERK genes have been conducted in some species [11–13,16,19],
a thorough study of the BnPERK gene family has yet to be published. Therefore, this study
systematically analyzed BnPERK genes, covering various aspects.
3.1. Deciphering the Evolutionary Dynamics of the BnPERK Genes
There were 50 PERK genes identified in the rapeseed cultivar ‘ZS11’ genome, highlight-
ing an increased number of BnPERK genes compared with previous studies (Supplementary
Table S3). This expansion of BnPERK genes was attributed to the evolutionary path of the
Brassica genus, which experienced a genome triplication following its divergence from the
Arabidopsis lineage [17,18]. Through interspecific hybridization between B. rapa (AA) and B.
oleracea (CC), the allotetraploid B. napus (AACC) arose. This complex evolutionary process
contributed to the expansion of the BnPERK gene family. Studies have consistently demon-
strated that whole-genome duplication and segmental duplications are crucial mechanisms
driving gene duplication and the expansion of gene families [20–22]. The prevalence of
paralogous gene pairs resulting from segmental duplication highlights the role of genome
duplication events in this expansion.
Initially, it was expected that each Arabidopsis gene would have six homologs in B.
napus due to two recent duplication events. However, only 50 BnPERK genes were identi-
fied, suggesting a loss of duplicated BnPERK genes following Brassica genome triplication
and hybridization. This indicated that gene loss was a crucial process during genomic
arrangements and chromosome doubling [23]. This also implied a selective process, where
functionally redundant BnPERK copies may have been lost, while the retained 50 BnPERK
genes may be crucial for plant development, hormone signaling, and stress response.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most AtPERK genes corresponded to 2–6 or-
thologous genes in B. napus, each of which included orthologs from both the A and C
subgenomes. However, some AtPERK genes showed variations in the number of corre-
sponding orthologous genes from the A and C subgenomes, suggesting extensive chromo-
somal rearrangements and asymmetric gene loss within duplicated genomic blocks [17].
Analysis of Ka/Ks ratios of paralogous gene pairs indicated purifying selection on dupli-
cated BnPERK genes, implying their functional conservation and evolutionary constraint at
these loci [24].
Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the BnPERK gene family not only en-
riches our knowledge of rapeseed genetics but also has broader implications for research in
plant biology and stress-response mechanisms.
3.2. Exploring the Structural Diversity and Functional Roles of BnPERKs
The BnPERK gene family exhibited significant structural diversity, including variations
in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points. These variations suggested
potential functional specialization within the gene family [25].
Although functional studies of BnPERKs are limited, expression profiling can still
provide valuable insights about the gene’s function and its role in different biological pro-
cesses [26]. In accordance with the result in A. thaliana, BnPERK family members exhibited
two distinct expression patterns: some were highly expressed in pollen, while others had
broader expression patterns [11]. Constitutive expression of certain BnPERK genes indi-
cated their essential roles in fundamental cellular functions, while some BnPERKs exhibited
higher expression levels in floral organs, which is consistent with findings in other species
like A. thaliana, B. rapa, Triticum aestivum, and Oryza sativa and indicates their importance
in floral development [11,12,16,19]. Specifically, 18 orthologs of AtPERK5, AtPERK6, At-

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 2685
13 of 19
PERK7, and AtPERK12 were notably expressed in pollen, among which AtPERK5 and
AtPERK12 were shown to be essential for pollen tube growth [11,27]. Furthermore, certain
B. rapa genes (orthologs of AtPERK6 and AtPERK12) were associated with male sterility,
as they were downregulated in male-sterile mutants [19]. BnPERK01A1 and BnPERK01C1
(orthologs of AtPERK1) showed constitutively high expression, suggesting essential roles
in fundamental cellular functions. Functional analysis of BnPERK1 indicated its role in
regulating cell wall integrity, signaling in stress responses, and facilitating growth and
development in Arabidopsis [15].
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the BnPERK genes originated through segmental
duplication [28]. Structural examination confirmed the phylogenetic arrangement, with
most BnPERK genes sharing conserved motifs and tyrosine kinase domains. Differences in
gene structure and cis-acting regulatory elements in promoters suggested evolutionary di-
vergence, which may contribute to functional diversity and evolutionary mechanisms [29].
Analysis of the cis-element indicated that BnPERK genes were responsive to various stresses
and hormone signaling pathways, with MeJA- and ABA-responsive elements being partic-
ularly abundant. This suggests that BnPERK genes could mediate diverse gene expression
patterns and provide flexibility in stress responses [30].
Further study on the expression patterns of BnPERK genes in response to hormone
treatments provided insights into their potential roles in hormone signaling and plant
development. This rapid and robust response to IAA, ET, GA, CK, and BL suggested that
BnPERK genes might play a crucial role in the early stages of hormonal signal transduction
in leaves, possibly by mediating the downstream effects of these hormones. In contrast, the
expression profiles in roots exhibited totally different expression patterns, which highlights
the complexity and specificity of hormonal regulation in different tissues. Enhanced ex-
pression levels after GA and ABA treatments in roots suggest involvements in root growth
and stress adaptation [31,32]. The contrasting expression patterns after MeJA treatment in
roots and leaves imply distinct roles in different tissues. Additionally, the observation that
genes such as BnPERK09A1, BnPERK09C1, and BnPERK04C1 were induced in both leaves
and roots after IAA treatment implies a role in auxin signaling, which is central to various
developmental processes, including cell elongation and differentiation [33]. These genes
may act as intermediaries in auxin signal transduction pathways, influencing growth and
development in a tissue-specific manner.
In summary, the comprehensive examination illuminates the structural diversity and
functional implications of the BnPERK gene family. The differential expression patterns of
BnPERK genes in response to various hormone treatments highlight their potential involve-
ment in diverse physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and
defense mechanisms.
3.3. Revealing the Role of BnPERK in Clubroot Disease
Recent studies have suggested that receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including PERKs
are involved in plant–pathogen interactions and immune responses [2–4]. Analysis of
cis-elements and expression profiles suggested that BnPERKs may act as novel sensors for
various stresses, particularly plant pathogen infections [5,12]. Protein–protein interaction
network analysis supported this result, revealing the multifunctionality of BnPERK proteins
and emphasizing their broad participation in plant physiological processes specific to plant
disease response [34]. The interactions involved cell wall organization, plant–pathogen
interactions, plasma membrane dynamics, endomembrane activities, MAPK signaling path-
ways, and starch/sucrose metabolism. Given that pathogen-induced changes in cell walls
affected disease resistance, it is possible that BnPERKs detect these alterations and initiate
responses to maintain cell wall integrity [35]. The membrane localization of BnPERKs

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 2685
14 of 19
suggested they might perceive infection signals at the cell’s surface. Upon activation by cell
wall components, BnPERKs likely trigger downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK
pathways [36]. Otherwise, MAPK pathways also acted as downstream signaling compo-
nents of hormones and played important roles in plant responses to different stresses [37].
Despite these insights, the exact role of BnPERKs in plant immunity remains largely un-
known, and their interactions with RLKs or coreceptors remain largely unexplored.
Clubroot disease, caused by the obligate parasite P. brassicae, poses a significant threat
to Brassicaceae plants [38]. The parasite is dependent on plant-derived sugars as a car-
bon source for colonization [39,40]. The enriched sugar metabolism reflects the altered
homeostasis and increased demand for sugar in infected plants. However, the downstream
signaling components and their regulation in response to P. brassicae infection are not yet
clear. The PERK gene family, with its known functions in cell wall integrity and stress
responses, may contribute to reinforcing the plant cell wall during pathogen infection
or modulating defense-related signaling pathways [5]. Given the role of PERKs in dis-
ease response, the involvement of the PERK gene family in B. napus in clubroot disease
was as expected. The transcriptional downregulation of BnPERK09A1, BnPERK09C1, Bn-
PERK14A1, and BnPERK06C2 upon P. brassicae infection suggests their putative roles in
clubroot disease response. In accordance with the result in B. napus, the expression of
AtPERK9 was also downregulated in response to P. brassicae. The perk9 mutant was used for
clubroot disease investigation, indicating the roles of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 in the
disease resistance. Pathogenesis-related proteins including enzymes like β-1,3-glucanase
(PR2) and thionins (PR5), which have antimicrobial activity and are involved in the basal
immune response [41]. The RBOHD (Respiratory burst oxidase homolog D) gene is crucial
in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of the plant immune system [42]. The
increased expression of these genes suggested that the knockout of AtPERK9 triggered the
basal immune response, resulting in increased disease resistance in perk9. The induction of
PR2 and RBOHD in both Col-0 and perk9 after inoculation suggested that basal immune
response occurred in susceptible Col-0. Furthermore, the induction of BnPERK09A1 and
BnPERK09C1 by IAA treatment was also particularly intriguing, as IAA is known to act as
a signaling molecule potentially involved in the response to P. brassicae infection [43–45].
However, the exact roles of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 need further function study.
The predicted interaction proteins associated with these pathways implied their roles in
mediating the interaction between B. napus and P. brassicae, providing targets for further
functional characterization.
In summary, uncovering the role of BnPERKs in clubroot disease response pro-
vided valuable insights into plant–pathogen interactions and potential strategies for
disease management.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Identification of BnPERK Genes in Brassica napus
The BnPERK gene family was selected in this study due to its critical role in plant
growth, development, and stress responses. It has not been extensively studied in B. napus,
making it a valuable target for genome-wide analysis. The genomic data and annotation for
the B. napus cultivar ‘ZS11’ were sourced from B. napus multi-omics information resource
(BnIR) (https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/BnIR, accessed on 1 March 2024) [46]. The PERK
genes in B. napus were identified using BLASTp (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with an
E-value threshold of 10−5, employing the protein sequence of 15 AtPERKs as queries [11].
The BnPERK gene family members were named based on their orthologous relationships
and chromosomal location. By searching the conserved domain in InterPro (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/interpro, accessed on 5 March 2024) and the NCBI Conserved Domain Database

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 2685
15 of 19
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, accessed on 5 March 2024), the
tyrosine kinase domain-containing protein sequences were verified for candidate BnPERK
genes. Additionally, Expasy (https://web.expasy.org/protparam, accessed on 8 March
2024) was utilized to assess the isoelectric points (pIs) and the molecular weights (MWs)
of BnPERK proteins. Subcellular locations of these proteins were predicted using Euk-
mPLoc [47] (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/euk-multi-2, accessed on8 March 2024).
4.2. Chromosomal Location, Gene Duplication, and Phylogenetic Analysis
The positions of the BnPERK genes on the chromosomes were obtained from the
annotation of the B. napus genome. McScanX (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/software/
mcscanx) was employed to detect the duplication patterns, including segmental and tan-
dem duplication [48]. Visualization of chromosomal distribution and duplication events
was represented using Circos (Vers. 0.69-9) software [49]. The Ka/Ks (nonsynonymous
substitution rate to synonymous substitution rate) ratio was calculated for the paralogous
gene pairs using ParaAT2.0 [50]. Collinearity analysis of BnPERK genes was conducted and
displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [51]. A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA
11 [52] through neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications and visualized
using iTol (https://itol.embl.de, accessed on 11 March 2024).
4.3. Gene Structure, Conserved Motifs, and Cis-Elements Analysis
The exon–intron structure of PERK genes was examined using Gene Structure Display
Server 2.0 (https://gsds.gao-lab.org/index.php/ accessed on 14 March 2024). Conserved
motifs were predicted using Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation (https:
//meme-suite.org/meme/tools/meme, accessed on 14 March 2024). The sequences of 2 Kb
upstream from the start codon of 50 BnPERK genes were extracted from the B. napus ‘ZS11’
genome and analyzed for cis-elements using PlantCARE [53] (http://bioinformatics.psb.
ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html, accessed on 14 March 2024) to predict cis-elements.
The data were visualized using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [51].
4.4. Expression Profiles of BnPERK Genes in Different Tissues and Under Hormone Treatments
To display different expression profiles, RNA-Seq data from various tissues and
the hormone response of B. napus cultivar ‘ZS11’ were obtained from BnIR. A total of
14 tissues at different development stages included seed, leaf, bud, root, petal, sepal, pollen,
silique, filament, cotyledon, lower stem peel, middle stem peel, upper stem peel, and
vegetative rosette stages. The roots and leaves were treated with hormones (IAA, auxin;
ACC, l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid; GA, gibberellin acid; ABA, abscisic acid; TZ,
trans-zeatin; JA, methyl jasmonate; BL, brassinolide) and sampled at 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h
after treatment. Heatmaps were generated using these expression values after logarithmic
transformed RPKM values and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [51].
4.5. Network-Based Prediction of Protein Interactions
Analysis of the protein–protein interaction network in B. napus was predicted using
STRING (https://cn.string-db.org/, accessed on 15 March 2024), and the interactions were
displayed using Cytoscape (Vers. 3.9.1) [54]. In order to investigate the biological process
involving B. napus genes, the putative interacted genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) and
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted
by BnaOmics [55] (https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net/tools/enrich/, accessed on 15
March 2024).

4.6. Plasmodiophora Brassicae Inoculation, Clubroot Disease Investigation, and
Histocytological Analysis
A collection of Plasmodiophora brassicae isolate from Zhijiang, Hubei, was used for inoc-
ulation in greenhouse. The seeds of B. napus cultivar ‘ZS11’, wild-type A. thaliana (Col-0),
and AtPERK9 mutant were germinated in a greenhouse maintained at 24 ◦C under a 16/8 h
light/dark photoperiod. Seven-day-old rapeseed seedlings were inoculated with resting
spores of P. brassicae at a concentration of 10−6 spores/mL [56]. Two-week-old Arabidopsis
seedlings were inoculated at a concentration of 10−5 spores/mL. The clubroot disease was
investigated and photographed at 28–35 days after inoculation. The disease index was
assessed using the following 0–3 scoring system: 0 refers to healthy roots; 1 refers to small
galls on lateral roots only; 2 refers to small and medium galls covering the main root and a
few lateral roots; 3 indicates large galls on the main root. The disease index (DI) was calcu-
lated according to the following formula: DI = 100 × (1 × N1 + 2 × N2 + 3 × N3)/3 × Nt.
N1 to N3 refer to the number of plants in the indicated class, and Nt is the total number of
plants tested.
The progression of cortex infection by P. brassicae was studied. Approximately 0.5 cm
long root segments were excised from the upper of the primary root. Following stan-
dard protocols for fixation and dehydration, the samples were embedded in paraffin and
sectioned at a thickness of 5–8 µM. Sections were analyzed and photographed using an
optical microscope.
4.7. Transcriptome Analysis of BnPERK Genes in B. napus During Clubroot Disease
Root samples of B. napus infected with P. brassicae and uninfected controls were har-
vested at 14 days after treatment for RNA-Seq analysis. After sequencing and quality
control, bioinformatics pipelines were using to clean raw sequencing data by removing
adapters and low-quality reads. Then, the clean reads were aligned to the genome of ‘ZS11’.
Gene expression levels were estimated using logarithmic transformed FPKM values. The
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and control samples were deter-
mined with the DEGseq2 (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2(fold-change)| ≥1) and displayed
using TBtools (Vers. 2.056).
4.8. qRT-PCR Analysis of Pathogenesis-Related (PR) Genes in A. thaliana
Root samples from Arabidopsis Col-0 and perk9 infected with P. brassicae and uninfected
controls were harvested at 14 days after inoculation for qRT-PCR study. Total RNA was
extracted from control and inoculated roots using the FastPure Universal Plant Total RNA
Isolation Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with HiScript
IV RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme). Gene-specific primers are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. Actin2 was used as reference gene. After running the qRT-PCR reactions, Ct
(cycle threshold) values were obtained for each sample. The relative expression level was
determined using the 2−∆∆Ct method [57]. The data were presented as the mean ± standard
error (SE) based on three technical replicates of three biological replicates. Significant
difference was determined at a p-value < 0.05.
5. Conclusions
The study emphasized the evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional
roles of the BnPERK gene family. It suggested that BnPERK genes are involved in various
physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and the defense
against pathogens. The transcriptional downregulation of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1
upon P. brassicae infection and the potential involvement of these genes in clubroot disease
response further emphasize their significance in plant immunity. The identification of

BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 as potential targets for disease management strategies and
their putative role in signaling networks could contribute to the resistance improvement of
Brassicaceae crops.
