Abstract
Background: Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the
salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order
to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral
titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-
flight.
Results: Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms
detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes
were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during
flight. At the genus level, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples
collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight,
their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers
revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation
between Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. There was also a significant positive correlation between
microbiome richness and EBV viral titers.
Conclusions: This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and
the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms
that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during
spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space
missions.

Introduction
The World Health Organization published a surveil-
lance strategy report in 2015 stating that worldwide,
non-infectious disease (NIDs) represented 43% of glo-
bal disease burden and was expected to be respon-
sible for 60% of the disease burden and 73% of all
deaths by 2020s [1]. In 2016, 80% of NID deaths were
due to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic re-
spiratory diseases, and diabetes, with the remaining
20% due to immune disorders, digestive issues, geni-
tourinary disease, and oral or dental conditions [2].
The collection of bacteria and less dominant micro-
organisms that inhabit our body is termed the human
microbiome and plays an integral role in maintaining
health. Changes in the composition of one’s micro-
biome may promote the development of the afore-
mentioned NIDs, as individuals with inflammatory
bowel disease [3, 4], asthma [5], diabetes [6], cardio-
vascular disease [7], colorectal cancer [8], and breast
cancer [9] have different bacterial communities than
healthy individuals. While it is still unclear whether
these microbial differences are a consequence or a
cause of disease, there is evidence in favor of the lat-
ter, as healthy animals transplanted with feces from
those with obesity [10], colitis [11], or colorectal can-
cer [12] then go on to develop disease.
The importance of the human microbiome in health
promotion is just as relevant to astronauts and perhaps
even more so, as medical procedures and facilities are
limited during spaceflight. As of 2018, there have been
557 astronauts/cosmonauts that have flown to outer
space with well-documented physiological and immuno-
logical issues, such as bone loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue,
elevated cortisol levels, nausea, skin/urinary tract/upper-
respiratory tract infections, and impaired innate/adaptive
immunity [13–15]. However, data is still limited on how
the human microbiome, which plays an integral role in
human health, is impacted by spaceflight and whether
changes in the astronaut microbiome contribute to the
conditions experienced by many astronauts.
Culture analyses conducted during the Skylab missions
suggest that oral microbial populations may change dur-
ing spaceflight, as increased counts of anaerobic bacteria
from intra-oral sites were recorded in-flight compared to
pre-flight samples from 18 astronauts studied [16]. The
effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiome should be
examined in detail as imbalances have been implicated
in oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immune regulation,
cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [17–21], and thus
could significantly impact the health of astronauts dur-
ing long-term spaceflight (i.e., manned missions to
Mars).
Reactivation of latent herpesviruses has been docu-
mented in astronauts for years. Reactivation of Epstein-
Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cyto-
megalovirus (CMV) have been observed during both
short (10–16 days) [22] and long (60–180 days) [23] dur-
ation ISS missions with longer missions producing
higher viral titers and prolonged shedding upon return
to Earth (shedding for 30 days post-flight [long duration
mission] vs shedding for 5 days post flight [shorter dur-
ation]) [23]. The impact of EBV shedding, for example,
on crew health could be limited to the minor symptoms
of infection to an increased risk of lymphoma, oral squa-
mous cell carcinoma, and mononucleosis [24, 25]. The
role of the oral microbiome in viral reactivation during
spaceflight has not yet been studied, but may be a key
factor in this phenomenon. Its role may be indirect,
through
immune
modulation
or
directly,
through
bacterial-viral interactions. Studies have shown that
short-chain fatty acids produced by oral bacteria induce
reactivation of latent human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and EBV,
by activating viral promotors and/or causing epigenetic
modifications in the inserted viral genome [26–29].
The aim of this study was to examine, for the first
time, whether and how the salivary microbiome changes
as a result of spaceflight and whether there is a micro-
biome signature that may be influential in preventing or
promoting viral reactivation in humans. The data ac-
quired from this study could help inform the NASA
medical team about the role of bacterial signatures in
maintaining crew health while in space.
Results
Eighty-nine samples from ten astronauts were analyzed
by 16S rRNA gene sequencing for microbiome analysis
and qPCR for viral titer measurements. The timepoints
for each sample collected the viral status, and flight his-
tory are presented in Dataset S1.
Impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome
Alpha
diversity
of
the
salivary
microbiome
was
assessed with Shannon’s diversity (measure of richness
and evenness), Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (phylo-
genetic difference between the observed sequences),
and community richness (number. of observed ampli-
con
sequence
variants
[ASVs]).
All
three
metrics
showed that microbiome diversity and richness in-
creased
during
spaceflight
(P
<
0.05)
but
then
dropped back to pre-flight levels upon return to Earth
(Fig. 1).
Streptococcus is the most abundant organism in the
saliva, and in this dataset consisted of 58 amplicon se-
quence variants, making up 8% of the total. For this rea-
son, it was of interest to examine how alpha diversity of
Streptococcus sequences changed as a result of space-
flight.
Unlike
the
collective
microbiome,
Shannon’s

diversity of Streptococcus was lower in spaceflight sam-
ples compared to pre-flight and post-flight samples (P <
0.05), and while diversity did rebound after flight, it did
not reach pre-flight values (Figure S1A). On the other
hand, while pre-flight and in-flight samples did not show
significant differences in richness (though the number of
observed Streptococcus sequences did decrease slightly
in-flight), there was a significant decrease in the number
of streptococcal sequences in samples collected post-
flight (Figure S1B).
Beta diversity of the salivary microbiome was also
compared.
Non-metric
multidimensional
scaling
(NMDS) of the centered log ratio (clr) transformed data
did not show any distinct clustering, indicating no over-
all microbiome differences between subjects and based
on
flight
status
(Fig.
2).
Statistical
analyses
using
ALDEx2 did, however, show that the relative abundances
of three phyla changed over time, with Proteobacteria
and Fusobacteria increasing in relative abundances dur-
ing flight and Actinobacteria decreasing (Fig. 3a). While
post-flight samples resembled pre-flight values more so
than flight values, they were either higher (Proteobac-
teria and Fusobacteria) or lower (Actinobacteria) than
what was observed pre-flight. At the genus level, in more
than half of the subjects tested, Catonella, Megasphera,
and Actinobacillus were absent in saliva collected pre-
flight but were then detected during flight (Fig. 3b). In
those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight,
their relative abundances increased during flight (Fig.
3b). The read counts of all genera detected and grouped
by subject, and flight status is summarized as a heatmap
in Figure S2.
While NMDS analysis of the salivary microbiome
showed no differences based on flight status at the
population level (Fig. 2), studies have shown that in
some cases, population level analyses may mask micro-
biome differences that occur at the individual level [30].
For this reason, NMDS ordination was performed for
each subject, in order to better understand the impact of
spaceflight on the salivary microbiome. Five out of the
10 subjects clustered based on flight status with pre-
flight, flight, and post-flight samples all different from
each other (Fig. 4). It is important to note that different
taxa were responsible for the differences based on flight
status in these five individuals. For the other five sub-
jects, while there was some overlap between samples col-
lected from the different flight groups, pre-flight samples
were never similar to post-flight samples.
Association between viral reactivation and salivary
microbiome
The
correlation
between
members
of
the
salivary
microbiome was examined for saliva samples that
were either positive or negative for EBV or HSV-1 (as
determined by
qPCR). Associations
between
phyla
changed depending on whether samples were negative
or positive for virus. In saliva devoid of virus (no viral
reactivation), positive correlations were present be-
tween (i) Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and (ii) Fuso-
bacteria and Proteobacteria, with an inverse relation
between (i) Gracilibacteria and Proteobacteria and (ii)
Absconditabacteria and Proteobacteria (Fig. 5a). How-
ever, in saliva with viral reactivation, all bacterial cor-
relations
disappeared
except
for
the
inverse
association between Gracilibacteria and Proteobacteria
(Fig. 5b).
To determine which genera were most discriminatory
between viral negative and viral positive samples, the
machine-learning algorithm random forests (RF) was ap-
plied to genus level abundance data. The out-of-bag
Fig. 1 Alpha diversity of salivary microbiome. Saliva samples were collected from 10 astronauts at various time points before flying to the ISS
(pre-flight), while on the ISS (Flight) and upon return to Earth (post-flight). Diversity was measured using Shannon’s diversity index (left panel) and
Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (right panel). Richness was measured by counting the number of unique amplicon sequence variants (ASV) within
each sample (middle panel). Reads were rarified to different counts (x-axis) and the values for each rarefied read count plotted (y-axis). For all 3
metrics tested, alpha diversity was the highest in-flight, with post-flight samples decreasing to pre-flight values. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of
variance followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison post-hoc test (Significance threshold P < 0.05).

(OOB) error rate was 24%, and the leave-one-out cross
validation (LOOCV) showed our model to be 75% accur-
ate. Taxa that proved most discriminatory between the
two groups were ordered according to mean decrease in
accuracy (Fig. 6). Gracilibacteria was the most predictive
followed by Lactobacillus, Stomatobaculum, and Oriba-
cetrium. RF was also applied to Streptococcus sequences
due to their abundance in the samples. With an OOB
error rate of 19% and a LOOCV accuracy of 81%,
Streptococcus strains were discriminatory between the
cohorts with S. mutans being the most predictive of viral
status (Fig S3).
Correlations were examined between viral copy num-
bers (determined by qPCR) and the relative abundances
of the microbiome (16S rRNA sequencing). Spearman’s
rho correlation values between EBV or HSV-1 viral
abundance and relative abundances of the salivary
microbiome are shown in the heatmap in Fig. 7. For
EBV, the strongest positive correlation was observed for
the candidate phyla Gracilibacteria and Absconditabac-
teria and the genus Abiotrophia. The strongest inverse
correlation was
observed
for Oribacterium, Clostri-
diales_FamilyXIII, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Haemophilus,
Johnsonella, and Stomatobaculum. No significant corre-
lations were, however, observed between HSV-1 viral
abundance and microbiome relative abundances, as all
Spearman’s rho correlations were under +/−0.3 (“weak
correlations”), and none of the correlations had p values
less than 0.05. A summary of Spearman’s rho and p
values for all genera for each virus is summarized in
Dataset S2.
Correlations were next examined between viral abun-
dance and microbiome diversity and richness. No signifi-

then clr transformed. No distinct clusters were observed, indicating no overall microbiome difference between subjects and based on flight
status. The same analysis was performed at the ASV level and showed the same trends as at the genus level. The data used for analysis was clr
transformed and Euclidean distances used.

Shannon’s diversity index was observed for EBV (p value
0.35, tau = −0.03) nor HSV-1 (p value = 0.87, tau = −
0.092).
However,
when

richness
was
examined, there was a significant positive correlation for
EBV (p value = 0.005, tau = 0.25) but not for HSV-1 (p
value = 0.34, tau = 0.09).
Discussion
Viral reactivation
The human microbiome has become a powerful tool to
help predict and modulate health and disease. The oral
microbiome specifically has been implicated in modulat-
ing oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immunity, cardio-
vascular disease, and diabetes [17–21]. However, there
have been limited studies to date that have explored the
possible interplay between the oral microbiome and la-
tent viral reactivation and propagation [26–29]. One of
the aims of this study was thus to determine whether
there was a salivary microbiome signature that could
help predict whether an astronaut would be more prone
or better protected against EBV, HSV-1, or VZV reacti-
vation. As none of the 89 saliva samples collected were
positive for VZV, the analyses presented in this paper
are based on EBV (30% of samples positive) and HSV-1
(22% of samples positive).
A positive correlation was found between EBV copy
number (qPCR viral data) and bacterial richness (an alpha
diversity measure of 16S rRNA observed sequences) which
suggests that as the number of bacterial strains increase
within a sample, the viral load also increases. In relation to
health and disease, high bacterial richness in the saliva has
been associated with poor oral health (decayed teeth, peri-
odontitis, and poor oral hygiene) [31, 32], and in the va-
gina, high bacterial diversity has been linked to bacterial
Fig. 3 Differential abundance of bacteria based on flight status. a ALDEx2 statistically analysis was performed on sequences summarized to the
phylum level. Significance was based on the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value of the Wilcoxon rank test (significance threshold P < 0.05).
Out of the nine phyla detected in saliva, three showed statistically significant differences as a result of spaceflight. The changes in their relative
abundances between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight are shown with boxplots. The box in each graph signifies the 75% (upper) and 25%
(lower) quartiles and thus shows the percent abundances for 50% of the samples. The black line inside the box represents the median. The
bottom whisker represents the lowest datum still within the 1.5 interquartile range (IQR) of the lower quartile, with the top whisker representing
the highest datum still within the 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile. Open circles are outliers. b In half of the subjects tested, three genera, Catonella,
Megasphaera, and Actinobacillus were not present in pre-flight samples, but were detected in samples collected during flight. In those that
already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased in-flight. The read counts for these three organisms in all ten subjects are
shown in a heatmap. Gray indicates that no reads were detected while a gradient from green to red shows low counts and high
counts, respectively

vaginosis [33]. It is unknown how increased bacterial rich-
ness may promote EBV reactivation and/or replication,
but one possibility is that certain strains, that may be
beneficial in maintaining latency and/or curbing viral
growth, become diluted in the sample (i.e., relative abun-
dance decreases) and thus do not have as profound an im-
pact on the host. Another hypothesis could be that the
additional strains not present in virus negative samples
produce metabolites that (i) induce reactivation, (ii)
directly interact with the viral particle to increase propaga-
tion, and/or (iii) minimize the ability of the host to prop-
erly clear viral particles. To note, there is the possibility
that weakening of the astronauts’ immune response dur-
ing spaceflight facilitates EBV reactivation and the growth
of bacterial strains that otherwise would be controlled by
the immune response, remaining undetected. While there
was a correlation between EBV and the microbiome, none
existed for HSV-1. Even though EBV and HSV-1 are both

an asterisk (*) beside the subject number indicates microbiome differences based on flight status. Differences are based on ellipses drawn around
samples based on a 99% confidence interval. Samples that belong to the same flight status and in the same ellipse, and which do not overlap
with other ellipses, are considered distinct groups, thereby having different microbiome profiles

members of the herpesvirus family (Herpesviridae), the
microbiome-viral interactions may differ and thus varied
responses will ensue.
The Spearman’s correlation analysis showed an inverse
correlation between EBV copy number and the relative
abundances of the genera Oribacterium, Lachnoanaeroba-
culum, Haemophilus, Johnsonella, and Stomatobaculum,
which, with the exception of Haemophilus, all belong to
the Lachnospiraceae family. These genera could also ac-
curately predict, as indicated by random forests, whether a
saliva sample was positive or negative for viral titers. Since
this study showed that a decrease in the relative abun-
dances of these bacteria are associated with higher viral ti-
ters, it suggests a protective role of these bacteria in
maintaining viral latency and/or inhibiting viral growth
once the lytic cycle is switched on.
Members of the genus Oribacterium are non-spore
forming, gram positive, motile, and strict anaerobes that
have been isolated from human subgingival plaque [34].
There are very few studies that make reference to it in
terms of health and disease, but there is one record of
Oribacterium being enriched in saliva samples from
healthy control subjects compared to saliva from pa-
tients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [35]. The
major fermentation end product of two of the three spe-
cies in this genus, which were both found in our dataset,
O. parvum and O. sinus, is lactate [34, 36]. Lactate levels
in the saliva could control viral titers once reactivation
occurs, as physiological levels of lactic acid present in
the vaginal tract have shown potency in HIV and Chla-
mydia inactivation [37, 38].
Lactate also significantly increases the production of
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by Veillonella [39, 40]. H2S has
been shown to be protective against pathogenic RNA vi-
ruses by decreasing the expression of viral proteins and
mRNA during the early stages of replication, [41, 42]
though no studies have been published regarding its pro-
tective capacity against DNA viruses. Veillonella, one of
the major H2S producers in the oral cavity [43], had a
significantly (p < 0.05) higher relative abundance in sam-
ples that came from subjects that never had a reactiva-
tion episode compared to samples that were negative for
virus but came from subjects that had a reactivation epi-
sode at least once (Figure S4A). It was also the most pre-
dictive organism, as assessed by random forests, for
these groups (Figure S4C). This raises the question as to
whether Veillonella or specifically H2S, which is also
produced by all three Lachnoanaerobaculum species
Fig. 5 Microbiome correlations based on viral status. 16S rRNA sequences were summarized to the phylum level, and a Spearman’s correlation
analysis was performed to assess correlations between the bacterial communities in the saliva. Two separate correlation tests were performed,
one with samples that were negative for either EBV or HSV-1 (as detected by qPCR) (a) and the second, using samples that were positive for virus
(based on qPCR) (b). The heatmaps display the Spearman’s rho values, with red boxes indicating rho values above 0.6 (strong positive correlation)
and yellow values indicating rho values less than −0.6 (strong inverse correlation). The maroon boxes represent no correlation. All red and yellow
microbiome correlations had Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p values of < 0.05. As observed from these heatmaps, there are more bacterial
correlations in saliva that are devoid of EBV and HSV-1 compared to saliva with viral shedding

[44], could play a role in maintaining viral latency.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potent inducer of latent
viral proteins and shown to induce reactivation of EBV
[45], Karposi’s sarcoma virus [46], and HIV [47]. In a
study involving wild-type and H2S deficient strains of
E.coli, H2O2 degradation in the cell was severely ham-
pered in the mutant strains compared to the wild-type
(H2S proficient) strains [48]. H2S has the ability to
antagonize H2O2 effects on the host [49], scavenge react-
ive oxygen species [50], and induce the expression of
catalases and peroxidases [50], all leading to lower
amounts of H2O2 in the host.
The ability of Haemophilus to utilize H2O2 could
be one of the ways it may protect the host against
reactivation. In addition to its aforementioned in-
verse correlation with viral load and its predictive
potential in random forests, Haemophilus, like Veil-
lonella, had a higher relative abundance in samples
that came from subjects that never had a reactiva-
tion episode compared to samples that were negative

for virus but that came from subjects that had a re-
activation episode at least once (Figure S4B). In a
study examining production and utilization of H2O2
by salivary bacteria, three species from the Strepto-
coccus mitis group produced high levels of H2O2
when grown aerobically (2–9.8 mM) and anaerobic-
ally (1.1- 3.9 mM) which was rapidly cleared (within
minutes) by Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. seg-
nis (as well as Neisseria sicca and Staphylococcus
epidermidis). When these pure cultures were incubated
with as high as 295 mM of H2O2, it was completely catab-
olized within 15 min [51].
There are also bacteria that may play a role in promot-
ing viral reactivation and/or propagation. Strong positive
correlations were found between EBV viral load and
Gracilibacteria and Abiotrophia relative abundances,
with Gracilibacteria being the most predictive taxa for
whether a sample was positive or negative for virus. Gra-
cilibacteria (a.k.a. GN02) is a candidate phylum, mean-
ing that no cultured representatives have been found but
Fig. 7 Correlation between salivary microbiome and viral load. 16S rRNA sequences were summarized to the genus level, and a Spearman’s
correlation analysis was performed between qPCR viral copy number and relative abundances of bacteria. The heatmap presented shows the
Spearman’s rho values, with red representing the highest positive values (positive correlation) and light yellow representing the lowest negative
values (inverse correlation). Of those that did not resolve to the genus level, but only to the family or phylum level, this is identified on the
heatmap as “f_” for family level resolution and “p_” for phylum level resolution. A summary of all rho values and their associated Benjamini-
Hochberg corrected p values are listed in Dataset S2

it is known to exist through 16S rRNA amplicon or
shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses. It was first
described in a study of the Guerrero Negro hypersaline
microbial mat [52] and since then at least 13 clones have
been detected from the human oral cavity [53]. In 2013,
single cell genomics was performed on 2 clones from
this candidate phylum and a re-coding of the opal stop
codon UGA for glycine was discovered [54]. Abiotro-
phia, on the other hand, is more dominant in the oral
cavity than Gracilibacteria, and one species, A. defectiva,
is most known for its role in infective endocarditis [55].
There is no information available, as yet, on how these
two
taxa
could
promote
viral
reactivation
and/or
replication.
While points have been made as to how the bacteria
that were predictive or correlative could play a role in
preventing or promoting viral reactivation/replication,
there is also the possibility that differences observed be-
tween the groups were a byproduct of viral reactivation
and replication changing the microbiome. A future study
with a larger sample size of astronauts that (i) never had
viral reactivation, (ii) were always positive for viral titers,
and (iii) at some time point experienced latency and at
other points experiencing shedding, which could help
answer the above question. A larger dataset would also
help determine whether a signature microbiome that
protects against or promotes reactivation/replication is
different depending on whether the astronaut is on Earth
or in space.
Based on the above data, the organisms that appear to
play a role in viral reactivation or propagation and which
in vitro studies may be useful, are Gracilibacteria, Abio-
trophia, Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus.
Impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome
This study examined how the salivary microbiome
changes as a result of spaceflight. Alpha diversity (rich-
ness, Shannon’s diversity, phylogenetic diversity) chan-
ged during flight but beta diversity (differences between
samples based on what is there and their abundances)
did not. While there were no population level differences
as a result of spaceflight, 5 out of the 10 subjects did
have distinct microbial communities pre-flight, in-flight,
and post-flight. It is interesting to note that for the five
subjects that had a significant difference in their micro-
biome, this was their first space mission, while the five
subjects that did not have microbiome differences, had
previously flown to the ISS. This may suggest that a per-
son’s microbiome is able to adapt to spaceflight and is
less recalcitrant to microbiome effects during spaceflight
upon re-exposure. For those five subjects whose micro-
biome was not impacted by flight, it was evident that
their post-flight samples were never similar to the pre-
flight samples, even after 6 months, suggesting that the
act of flying to the ISS causes either an irreversible
change in the oral microbiome or a change that takes
longer than 6 months to rebound. Further studies would
need to be done to examine the consequence of these
changes on the long-term health of the astronaut. Since
each subject had different microbes influencing the mi-
crobial communities, a focus on a personalized astronaut
microbiome to maintain health and prevent disease
would be necessary.
Conclusions
This is the first study to look at how the salivary micro-
biome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search
for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further
studies examining the role of specific organisms that
were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral re-
activation, a serious problem in astronauts during space-
flight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent
disease during both short and long duration space
missions.
Methods
Saliva sample collection and DNA extraction
Saliva samples were collected from 10 male astronauts at
various time points over the course of their mission. The
duration of spaceflight ranged from 2–9 months with an
average ISS mission being 4.4 months. Samples were col-
lected (i) two times pre-flight, at 180 days (L-180) and
90 (L-90) days before launch, (ii) three times during
flight, at early (1–2 months on ISS) and mid (2–4
months on ISS), and late (10 days before landing) time
points and (iii) four times post-flight, on landing day (R
+ 0), 30 days (R + 30), 60 days (R + 60), and 180 days (R
+ 180) after return. These time points were adjusted
(+/−30 days) according to the convenience of crew
members. The samples were collected by the astronauts
themselves by placing a synthetic polymer swab (Sali-
metrics LLC, State College, PA) in one’s mouth and
swirling it around for 2–3 min until saturation. The sam-
ples were stored at −80 °C until ready to process. Once
all samples from a given subject was collected, they were
thawed and then centrifuged at ×1400g for 5 min to sep-
arate the fluid from the swab. The separated fluid was
stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction and the swab
discarded.
DNA isolation
The frozen fluid was allowed to thaw on ice and then
vortexed and centrifuged at ×16,000g for 20 min to make
a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant
was discarded, and the cell pellet was re-suspended in
200 μL PBS. DNA was extracted from this re-suspended
pellet with a QIA-Amp DNA kit (Qiagen; Germantown,
MD). DNA concentration was determined with the

Detection and quantification of EBV, HSV-1, and VZV
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a TaqMan
7900 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using
fluorescence-based amplification. Two microliters of
viral DNA was added to 2× TaqManTM Fast Universal
PCR master mix (Thermofischer, USA), with primers
added to a final concentration of 100 nmol and probes
added to a final concentration of 50 nmol. Primer se-
quences and probes for the herpes viruses (EBV, VZV,
and HSV-1) along with the glyceraldehyde 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) DNA sequences are listed in
Table 1 and have been described previously [22]. Viral
DNA
standards
generated
from
each
herpes
virus
ranging from 100 to 106 copies/μl were included in all
reactions. Reactions were performed in triplicate and
were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s,
followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s, and 60 °C for 20 s.
A sample was considered negative for virus if it had
lower than 10 copies of viral DNA.
Microbiome analysis
The scripts used to perform the following processing
and analyses are presented in Dataset S3.
Library preparation and sequencing
The V3/V4 region (~ 460 bp) of the isolated genomic
DNA was paired-end sequenced (2 × 300 bp) on the
Illumina Mi-Seq platform following the protocol out-
lined by Illumina (https://support.illumina.com/docu-
ments/documentation/chemistry_documentation/16s/16
s-metagenomic-library-prep-guide-15044223-b.pdf).
To
summarize, amplicon PCR was performed by adding
2.5ul of 5 ng/ul of DNA to 5 ul of 1uM Forward primer,
5ul of 1uM reverse primer, and 12.5 ul of 2× KAPA HiFi
HotStart ReadyMix. Forward primer sequences are 5′
TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGA-
CAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3′. Reverse primer
sequences are 5′GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGGTA-
TAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC
3′.
The PCR condition were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min
followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30s,
and 72 °C for 30s. A final elongation step was performed
at 72 °C for 5 min.
Following quality control and PCR clean up, index
PCR was set up with the Nextera XT index kit and a
limited-cycle amplification (8 cycles) to attach dual indi-
ces and adapters to the amplicons. The library was
quantified using Qubit and normalized to 4 nM for all
samples, after which all samples were pooled together.
The pooled library was loaded onto the sequencer at
6pM with 10% phiX spiked in. The Miseq run utilized
the v3 chemistry and 2 × 300 cycle sequencing kit (MS-
102-3003). Samples were demultiplexed and adaptors re-
moved using bcl2fastq from Illumina.
16S rRNA raw data processing and quality control
The DADA2 pipeline [56] (https://benjjneb.github.io/
dada2/index.html) was used for quality control and pro-
cessing (including chimera removal) of the raw demulti-
plexed reads resulting in an amplicon sequence variant
(ASV) table, a “higher resolution analogue of the trad-
itional OTU table.” The filter and trim parameters were
truncLen = c (280, 220), trimLeft = c (17, 21), maxN = c
(0, 0), maxEE = c (2, 2), truncQ = c (2, 2), and rm.phix =
c (TRUE, TRUE).
Taxonomy was assigned with the SILVA reference
database (version 128) (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/
training.html) using both the “nr” and “species assign-
ment” databases. A custom script was used to filter the
ASV table to keep only those samples that had greater
than 100 reads and to keep only those ASV that were at
least 0.01% abundant in a sample. The NTC sequencing
control had 170 reads, with none of the ASV shared be-
tween the samples. The two kit controls had 6094 and
2969 reads. ASVs that were found exclusively in the kit
control were removed from the table, along with 14
ASVs that were found in the kit controls and at least
one sample. The average number of reads across all
samples was 126,694 (ranging from 6216 to 312,133) to-
taling 697 ASVs.
The positive control that was processed with DADA2
(92,514 reads) validated our pipeline as the sequence
was only present in the positive control and had a 100%
match with 100% coverage to the reference sequence.
Bioinformatics analyses
Alpha diversity metrics (Shannon’s diversity, Richness,
Phylogenetic diversity) were calculated in QIIME [57].
Multiple rarefactions were performed on the ASV table,

with the following arguments: −m 1000 (seq/sample), −
x 100000 (seq/sample), and −s 5000 (steps between
min/max of seq/sample), with the number of reps being
two, −n 2. For alpha diversity of Streptococcus ASVs,
the conditions were as followed: −m 1000, −x 50000, −
s 4000, and −n 1. The data generated in QIIME was
plotted and visualized in Prism (v.7). Significance be-
tween pre-flight, flight, and post-flight samples was mea-
sured using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of
variance, paired design, followed by the Benjamini-
Hochberg multiple comparison post-hoc test in Prism.
Linear regression analyses were also performed which
produced the same results as the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Phyla and genus level data used in various analyses
were
summarized
from
ASV
data
using
QIIME.
NMDS, heatmaps, and boxplots were generated in R
(http://www.R-project.org/) using centered log ratio
(clr) transformed data (transformed using the “com-
positions” package in R) with a uniform prior of 0.5
added to each value before transformation [58, 59].
The ALDEx2 package in R was used to compare the
relative abundances of phyla and genera between the
different
flights.
Significance
was
based
on
the
Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value of the Wil-
coxon rank test (significance threshold P < 0.05).
Spearman’s rho values and corresponding p values for
correlation analyses between phyla (clr transformed
data) from samples either positive or negative for virus
(Fig. 5 data) were generated in R using the rcorr func-
tion. The p.adjust function was used to correct the p
values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The heat-
maps of rho values were generated using the heatmap.2
function in the “gplots” package.
Kendall tau and corresponding p values for correlation
analysis between (i) Shannon’s diversity and qPCR viral
load and (ii) observed richness and qPCR viral load was
performed with the cor.test function in R for each rar-
efaction, followed by a false discovery rate p value cor-
rection using the p.adjust function.
Correlation analysis between the microbiome and viral
load was performed using the ALDEx2 package as previ-
ously described [33]. Briefly, the Spearman’s rank correl-
ation between the relative abundances of each genus (clr
transformed) in 128 inferred technical replicates and the
EBV and HSV-1 viral load as measured by qPCR was
calculated using the aldex.corr function. Spearman’s rho
values were converted to p values and corrected by the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using the cor.test func-
tion in R. The heatmap of Spearman’s rho values was
generated using the heatmap.2 function in the “gplots”
package.
Random forests analysis was performed in R using the
“randomForest,” “plyr,” “rfUtilities,” and “caret” packages
on clr transformed data. LOOCV and OOB methods
were employed using 500 decision trees, 1000 permuta-
tions, and 7 features to be randomly sampled at each
node in the tree (i.e., mtry = 7).

in the saliva. Saliva samples were collected from 10 astronauts at various
timepoints before flying to the ISS (pre-flight), while on the ISS (flight)
and upon return to Earth (post-flight). Streptococcal diversity was
measured using Shannon’s diversity index (A) and richness was measured
by counting the number of unique Staphylococcus amplicon sequence
variants within each sample (B) Reads were rarified to different counts (x-
axis) and the values for each rarefied read count plotted (y-axis).
Shannon’s diversity was lowest during flight compared to pre-flight and
post-flight samples. Richness, on the other hand, was lowest during post-
flight, with pre-flight and in-flight having similar number of observed
Streptococcus sequences. Figure S2. Heatmap of read counts of genera
detected in the saliva. ASVs were summarized, based on taxonomy, to
the genus level and all those that could be assigned to a genus were in-
cluded in this heatmap. Multiple samples were collected from each astro-
naut but were averaged for a given flight status. The data was then clr
transformed. Clr values that are positive are higher than the geometric
mean (and thus can be considered more abundant) and those that are
negative are lower than the geometric mean (and can be considered less
abundant). The heatmap is separated by subject and by flight status (i.e.
pre-flight, in-flight or post-flight samples). In the heatmap, red represents
the highest clr value and light green the lowest. Figure S3. Streptococcus
