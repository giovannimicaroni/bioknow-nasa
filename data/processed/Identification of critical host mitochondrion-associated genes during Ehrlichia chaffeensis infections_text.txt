Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). To determine what
host components are important for bacterial replication, we performed microarray analysis on Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells
by comparing host gene transcript levels between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E. chaffeensis growth. Five-hun-
dred twenty-seven genes had increased transcript levels unique to permissive growth conditions 24 h postinfection. We screened
adult ﬂies that were mutants for several of the “permissive” genes for the ability to support Ehrlichia replication. Three addi-
tional D. melanogaster ﬂy lines with putative mutations in pyrimidine metabolism were also tested. Ten ﬂy lines carrying muta-
tions in the genes CG6479, separation anxiety, chitinase 11, CG6364 (Uck2), CG6543 (Echs1), withered (whd), CG15881 (Ccdc58),
CG14806 (Apop1), CG11875 (Nup37), and dumpy (dp) had increased resistance to infection with Ehrlichia. Analysis of RNA by
quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) conﬁrmed that the bacterial load was decreased in these mutant
ﬂies compared to wild-type infected control ﬂies. Seven of these genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, Ccdc58, and Apop1) en-
coded proteins that had mitochondrial functions or could be associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. Treatment
of THP-1 cells with double-stranded RNA to silence the human UCK2 gene indicates that the disruption of the uridine-cytidine
kinase affects E. chaffeensis replication in human macrophages. Experiments with cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), a CTP synthe-
tase inhibitor and cytosine, suggest that the nucleotide salvage pathway is essential for E. chaffeensis replication and that it may
be important for the provision of CTP, uridine, and cytidine nucleotides.
E
hrlichia chaffeensis is the causative agent of human monocytic
ehrlichiosis (HME). There were 1,429 cases of HME in 2010
and 2011 (14). This represents a signiﬁcant increase in the inci-
dence of the disease since 2003 and qualiﬁes HME as an emerging
infectious disease (25). In addition to being reported in the United
States, HME has also been documented in Africa, Europe, China,
and Brazil (9, 16, 42, 67). E. chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular
bacterium. However, little is known about the parasitized-host
requirements for bacterial replication.
Drosophila melanogaster has been used to study a variety of
intracellular pathogens. In particular, it has been successfully ma-
nipulated for the identiﬁcation of genes involved in host-patho-
gen interactions. These pathogens include Listeria monocytogenes
(1, 2), Chlamydia trachomatis (20), Mycobacterium marinum (1,
18, 30, 48), Francisella tularensis (51, 64), and the protozoan par-
asite Plasmodium gallinaceum (8, 53).
We previously demonstrated that E. chaffeensis is capable of
infecting, completing its life cycle, and maintaining its pathoge-
nicity in both Drosophila S2 cells (39) and adult ﬂies (40). We have
also identiﬁed growth conditions that were nonpermissive for the
growth of E. chaffeensis infection in Drosophila S2 cells (39).
Therefore, we hypothesized that a transcriptional microarray
analysis of permissively infected and nonpermissively infected S2
cells would reveal host genes that contribute to the replication of
Ehrlichia. We used the Affymetrix Drosophila 2.0 array to identify
a subset of genes that were exclusively expressed during E.
chaffeensis infection in infected S2 cells under permissive growth
conditions. We screened adult ﬂies carrying mutations in several
of the candidate genes, 10 of which change the ﬂy response to E.
chaffeensis compared to wild-type ﬂies. Gene products from 7 of
the 10 genes identiﬁed are associated with mitochondrial function
and/or location. We also describe follow-up experiments to inves-
tigate how Uck2 might function and its relevance to mammalian
infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Maintenance of cell lines and E. chaffeensis infections. The canine mac-
rophage cell line DH82 (ATCC CRL-10389) was cultured in Eagle’s min-
imal essential medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA) (EMEM7). THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202)
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
Drosophila S2 cells, obtained from the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center
(Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), were cultivated at 25°C in Sch-
neider’s Drosophila medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. For experiments, S2 cells were seeded at a
concentration of 1  106 cells/well in 6-well plates.
The E. chaffeensis Arkansas isolate was continuously cultivated in
DH82 cells, as described previously, at 37°C, 8% CO2 in EMEM7 (40).
Puriﬁed bacteria were used to reinfect DH82, THP-1, and S2 cells.
Infections in permissive and nonpermissive Drosophila S2 cells. To
make S2 cells nonpermissive to E. chaffeensis infection, the cells were al-
lowed to adhere for 30 min prior to adding sonicated lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) from Salmonella enterica serovar Minnesota (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
at a concentration of 10 g per ml. The S2 cells plus LPS were incubated

for 5 h prior to infection with E. chaffeensis. The Ehrlichia-infected S2 cells
were monitored at 24 and 96 h postinfection (p.i.). Additionally, unin-
fected S2 cells, inactivated and activated with LPS, were used as controls.
S2 cells were centrifuged at 300  g for 5 min prior to RNA isolation from
cell pellets using 1 ml of TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.,
Cincinnati, OH). The TriReagent-cell mixture was transferred to 2.0-ml
Heavy Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 Prime, Westbury, NY). Chloroform (200
l) was added, and the mixture was gently mixed for 15 s. After centrifu-
gation at 12,000  g for 10 min at 4°C, the aqueous phase was poured into
1.5-ml tubes. The RNA was precipitated and washed with isopropanol
and ethanol according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA pellet
was suspended in 50 l of nuclease-free water, and the RNA concentra-
tion was determined spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE) before and after DNA digestion using a Turbo DNA-
free kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX).
Determination of infection by RT-PCR and quantitative real-time
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). For the microarray, infections were conﬁrmed by
reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR using the Promega Access One-Step RT-
PCR kit (Madison, WI). Total RNA (750 ng) was used for each 25-l
reaction mixture, which contained the following reagents: 1 buffer, 0.2
mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 2 M forward primer, 2
M reverse primer, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 1 U/l DNA polymerase, 1 U/l
reverse transcriptase, and nuclease-free water. RT-PCRs were performed
in a thermocycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient, Hauppauge, NY).
Primers and probes were designed with Primer Quest software (Inte-
grated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and data from NCBI reference
sequences (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). RT-PCR condi-
tions for the 16S rRNA of E. chaffeensis were 48°C for 45 min, 94°C for 4
min, and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min
(21). The ribosomal protein 49 gene (rp49) was used as a housekeeping
gene in RT-PCR experiments with Drosophila S2 cells. The RT-PCR con-
ditions for rp49 gene ampliﬁcation were 48°C for 45 min, 94°C for 2 min,
and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min.
No-template RT-PCR controls were also included. RT-PCR product
bands were identiﬁed on a ChemiImager (Protein Simple, Santa Clara,
CA) after electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and staining with ethidium
bromide.
Flies were anesthetized using CO2 prior to homogenization with dis-
posable pestles (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ) in 1 ml of TriReagent. The
homogenates were transferred to 2.0 ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel tubes and
processed as described above for RNA isolation.
Ehrlichia quantiﬁcation in S2 cells and ﬂy experiments was estimated
using TaqMan-based qRT-PCR, as previously described (40, 55), using
Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a as the housekeeping gene with primers
described in Table S1 in the supplemental material. E. chaffeensis was
detected as described previously (40, 55). The qRT-PCRs were performed
in the Cepheid SmartCycler System (Sunnyvale, CA).
Analysis of gene expression based on qRT-PCR results was performed
using the method described by Pfafﬂ(47). In short, primer efﬁciencies
were calculated from standard dilution curves plotting threshold cycle
(CT) values versus log RNA using the following equation: efﬁciency 
10
(1/slope of standard curve).
The change in CT values for both genes of interest and housekeeping
controls was determined by calculating the CT using the following
equation: (efﬁciency of gene of interestGene of interest:CT control  treated)/
(efﬁciency of housekeeping geneHousekeeping gene:CT control  treated).
Microarray analysis. Microarray analysis was performed at the Uni-
versity of Kansas Medical Center Microarray Facility (Kansas City, KS)
using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) Drosophila 2.0 Gene chips according
to the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations. The analysis was performed on four
treatment groups (each submitted in triplicate at 24 h p.i.): (i) S2 cells
infected with E. chaffeensis, (ii) S2 cells incubated with LPS and then
infected with E. chaffeensis, (iii) S2 cells incubated with LPS, and (iv)
untreated/uninfected S2 cells. CHP ﬁles were analyzed using GeneSpring
7.3 software and normalized by “per gene: normalize to median.” The
“ﬁlter on volcano plot” was applied at 1.5-fold change and one-way anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) at a signiﬁcance level () of 0.05. Genes up-
regulated 1.5-fold or more above basal expression levels were identiﬁed
under both permissive and nonpermissive conditions compared to unin-
fected controls at 24 h p.i. These gene sets were then compared, and those
upregulated exclusively under either permissive or nonpermissive condi-
tions at 24 h p.i. were identiﬁed. Microarray MIAMI-compliant data are
available at the publicly accessible database (http://bioinformatics.kumc
.edu/mdms/login.php) by accessing the experiment entitled “Differential
Gene Expression in Ehrlichia chaffeensis-infected S2 cells.”
D. melanogaster. Flies were maintained on standard dextrose-molasses-
yeast medium at 18 to 29°C. For all experiments, ﬂies with the appropriate
background were used as wild-type (WT) controls. w;Hemese-Gal4 UASGFP
ﬂies (GFPHeme) (from Michael J. Williams, Umea Centre for Molecular
Pathogenesis, Umea University, Umea, Sweden), yellow-white (yw) (main-
tained in our stock collection at Kansas State University), and/or white ocelli
(wo1) (stock number 634, from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN) were used as the WT in these experi-
ments. withered (whd1) (FBgn0004012; stock number 441), dumpy (dpov1)
(FBgn0053196; stock number 276), and tilt (tt1wo1) (FBgn0003868; stock
number 623) mutants are all the result of spontaneous mutations (35, 44, 65)
andwereobtainedfromtheBloomingtonDrosophilaStockCenteratIndiana
University, Bloomington, IN. The stock numbers, genotypes, and associated
genes of adult Drosophila ﬂies screened by microinjection are listed in Table
S2 in the supplemental material.
Adult Drosophila Infections. Flies were transferred to fresh food at
least 24 h prior to injection/infection. For injection/infection, adult male
and female ﬂies were anesthetized with CO2 (for no longer than 15 min at
a time). Flies were injected with approximately 50 nl of sterile PBS or with
5,000 bacteria, using pulled glass capillary needles. Injections were made
in the abdomen of the ﬂy, close to the junction of the thorax and ventral to
the junction between the dorsal and ventral cuticles. Following injection,
the ﬂies were maintained in clean bottles with molasses caps that were
changed every other day throughout the course of the experiments. Sur-
vival of the ﬂies was monitored daily.
CPEC treatment of S2 cells. Cyclopentenylcytosine (CPEC) was ob-
tained from the National Cancer Institute (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry
Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treat-
ment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) through a
Materials Transfer Agreement. The CPEC was prepared to a ﬁnal concen-
tration of 15.06 mM using sterile water containing 1% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). Two different infection protocols were used for testing the effect
of CPEC on the growth of E. chaffeensis in the S2 cells. For the ﬁrst pro-
tocol, CPEC was added to S2 cells at ﬁnal concentrations of 100, 10, 1, or
0.1 M/well; E. chaffeensis was added to the treated cells 2 days later, and
RNA was extracted from the cells 2 days postinfection. For the second
protocol, S2 cells were infected with E. chaffeensis for 2 days, and then
various concentrations of CPEC were then added and RNA extractions
were performed 2 days following the CPEC treatment. S2 cells treated with
diluent only and infected with Ehrlichia and uninfected S2 cells were used
as controls. A qRT-PCR assay was used to analyze transcript levels of
Ehrlichia 16S rRNA and Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a, as described
above.
Addition of exogenous cytosine to Drosophila S2 cells. Cytosine was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The cytosine was dissolved in 500 mM
hydrochloric acid and then in sterile water to 100 mM, according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. For infection experiments, S2 cells
were incubated for 24 h prior to cytosine addition to a ﬁnal concentration
of 25 mM; the cells were further incubated for 24 h. E. chaffeensis was
added to the cytosine-treated cells, to untreated S2 cells, and to S2 cells
treated with the cytosine diluent. Untreated, uninfected S2 cells were used
as a negative control. RNA was extracted from the cells at 24, 48, 72, and 96
h p.i. qRT-PCR was used to measure transcript levels of Ehrlichia 16S
rRNA and Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a, as described above.

THP-1 cell differentiation and cell cultures. THP-1 human macro-
phages were cultured as described above. For differentiation, THP-1 cells
(6  104 THP-1 cells/well; 24-well plates) were incubated with phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis,
MO) at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 M. The cells were cultured for 24 h to
allow ﬁnal differentiation into macrophages in a cell culture incubator at
37°C with 8% CO2.
Measurement of transfection efﬁciency and UCK2 knockdown. We
selected the small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection conditions based
on the transfection efﬁciency in the cells of a ﬂuorescently labeled trans-
fection control siRNA duplex conjugated with the ﬂuorescent marker
TYE 563. Transiently transfected cells were analyzed for transfection efﬁ-
ciency using ﬂuorescence microscopy.
UCK2 transcript expression was knocked down in THP-1 cells using
siRNA speciﬁc to the human UCK2 transcript. We used the TriFecta RNA
interference (RNAi) kit with predesigned oligonucleotide sets from IDT.
The siRNA predesigned oligonucleotide query was done using the UCK2
RNA
coding
sequence
(CDS)

XM_846154.2 for Homo sapiens. We also used scrambled siRNA and hu-
man hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) siRNAs as nega-
tive and positive controls, respectively, to conﬁrm transfection and siRNA
knockdown efﬁciency. All siRNA duplexes were dissolved in nuclease-free
water (pH 7.2) to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 nM. Three UCK2-speciﬁc, an
HPRT-speciﬁc, and scrambled siRNA duplexes were transfected into dif-
ferentiated THP-1 cells using the Lipofectamine transfection reagent (In-
vitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
THP-1 cells were infected with E. chaffeensis 48 h posttransfection.
Transfected and Ehrlichia-infected THP-1 cells were analyzed for UCK2,
HPRT knockdown efﬁciency and the level of bacterial infection by qRT-
PCR 48 h postinfection using primers and probes described in Table S1 in
the supplemental material, as explained above.
TEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of unin-
fected and E. chaffeensis-infected DH82 cultures was performed as de-
scribed previously (17).
Statistics. Data are presented as means and standard errors of the
mean (SEM). Differences in means were determined using the Mann-
Whitney two-tailed rank-sum statistical test, which is independent of the
underlying population distribution (StatMost statistical package; Data
XIOM, Los Angeles, CA). Survival data were analyzed for signiﬁcance
using the log rank test of Kaplan-Meier plots and Prism (La Jolla, CA)
Graphpad software. P values of  0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Microarray “permissive-exclusive” genes after infection with E.
chaffeensis. To identify host genes that are necessary for E.
chaffeensis infection, we examined transcript levels of Drosophila
S2 cells under four different conditions at 24 h p.i. to assess the
host factors that might be needed to initiate the infection. They
included (i) uninfected S2 cells, (ii) uninfected S2 cells activated
with LPS, (iii) S2 cells activated with LPS and then infected with E.
chaffeensis (nonpermissive conditions; this experiment, per-
formed as in previous studies, demonstrated the inhibition of E.
chaffeensis replication in LPS-activated S2 cells [43]), and (iv) S2
cells infected with E. chaffeensis (permissive conditions). E.
chaffeensis replicated only under permissive conditions and not
under nonpermissive conditions for as long as 96 h p.i. (Fig. 1).
Uninfected cells were used to discern the basal transcript levels in
the S2 cells, and comparisons across the different conditions were
based on this basal level of expression. In order to understand
which gene transcripts were speciﬁc to nonpermissive S2 cells, we
used the S2 cells that were treated only with LPS as a comparison.
Cells that received only LPS treatment revealed activation-speciﬁc
gene transcripts. We compared those genes to the genes that had
increased transcript levels in cells infected under nonpermissive
conditions for bacterial growth to deduce transcripts that were
upregulated exclusively under nonpermissive conditions. We also
determined the gene transcripts that were upregulated 1.5-fold or
more exclusively under permissive infection conditions for E.
chaffeensis growth, and 2,128 genes were upregulated 1.5-fold
more than in uninfected controls. Under nonpermissive growth
conditions, 1,742 of the genes were upregulated 1.5-fold more
than in uninfected S2 cells. When we compared transcripts that
were upregulated under permissive growth conditions to tran-
scripts that were upregulated under nonpermissive growth condi-
tions, we identiﬁed 527 genes unique to permissive conditions
(see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Of these, 210 had
previously been ascribed some function and had some character-
ization. The functions of the remaining 307 genes had yet to be
deﬁned and had “CG” (computed gene) gene designations. How-
ever, a number of these genes had orthologs with some described
properties. These ortholog gene descriptions were used to ascribe
functions for our analyses. Viable and fertile adult ﬂy mutant
stocks were available for 118 of the 527 genes (37 stocks for deﬁned
genes and 81 stocks for undeﬁned genes). These ﬂies had appro-
priate mutations in coding exons in the genes of interest and al-
lowed testing of how the absence of a functional gene would affect
ﬂy survival and/or bacterial replication in vivo. Our screen of mu-
tant ﬂy lines was loosely based on descriptions of genes that con-
trolled functions that we guessed might be important for bacterial
growth or were random choices of CG-designated genes.
E. chaffeensis infection in selected mutant Drosophila ﬂy
lines. We screened 19 Drosophila lines with mutations in the genes
of interest (see Table S2 in the supplemental material) for bacterial
replication and ﬂy survival. Flies (wild type and mutant) were
injected with cell-free E. chaffeensis or sterile PBS and monitored
for survival for 96 to 120 h p.i. (20 ﬂies per treatment group per
experiment; the experiment was repeated independently at least 3
times). We looked for the mutants that displayed increased sur-
vival of the ﬂies after bacterial challenge compared to the wild-
type ﬂies. Our hypothesis was that the gene affected in a mutant
allowed increased survival because its expression was needed for E.
chaffeensis replication. We found that the ﬂies that had mutations
in Nup37, Echs1, Cht11, CG6479, Ccdc58, Apop1, san, and Uck2
displayed signiﬁcantly increased survival compared to wild-type
ﬂies after infection with E. chaffeensis (Fig. 2). In contrast, several
mutants did not show increased resistance to E. chaffeensis infec-
tions. They included three G3pdh mutants (stock 1124, shown in
Fig. 2) and CG14434 (Fig. 2), as well as CG10672, CG4743,
CG9300, tsp3A, CG10992, and Gap69C (data not shown).
To conﬁrm that Nup37, Echs1, Cht11, CG6479, Ccdc58, Apop1,
san, and Uck2 gene mutations affected E. chaffeensis infections, we
also estimated bacterial replication as measured by qRT-PCR (Fig.
3). Experimental infection of ﬂies with disruptions in all 8 genes
resulted in a signiﬁcant drop in the numbers of bacteria compared
to those observed in wild-type ﬂies infected with the organism
(Fig. 3).
Uridine/cytidine kinase mutations affect ﬂy survival and
bacterial replication. To understand the physiological relevance
of disruption of gene function to E. chaffeensis growth in the host,
we focused on Uck2, as an ortholog for this gene has been identi-
ﬁed in mammalian species (43). Stroman (56) previously reported
that the Drosophila dumpy, tilt, and withered stocks carried a mu-
tation(s) that affects uridine/cytidine kinase function. To conﬁrm
the impact of Uck2 on E. chaffeensis growth, the three ﬂy lines with

putative defects in uridine/cytidine kinase function were infected
with E. chaffeensis and assessed for bacterial replication. Two of
these ﬂy lines were signiﬁcantly more resistant to E. chaffeensis
challenge than WT ﬂies (Fig. 4). For example, at 96 h p.i., 61% of
the dumpy ﬂies were alive compared to 42% of WT ﬂies; similarly,
66% of withered ﬂies survived compared to 38% of WT ﬂies (P 
0.05). Although there was a tendency for the tilt ﬂies (60% 	 16%
survival) to be more resistant than the WT ﬂies (46% 	 7% sur-
vival), the differences were not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 4). The
increased survival of the withered and dumpy mutants was accom-
panied by a signiﬁcant decrease in the replication of the Ehrlichia
organisms, as measured by qRT-PCR assay (Fig. 3). At 96 h p.i.,
WT ﬂies contained signiﬁcantly more bacteria than withered and
dumpy mutants (P  0.02) (Fig. 3, bottom). The tilt mutants
averaged fewer bacteria, but there was more variation in the sam-
ples.
CPEC treatment increases E. chaffeensis infection. The uri-
dine/cytidine kinase enzyme functions in pyrimidine synthesis
pathways and is speciﬁcally involved in the conversion of uridine
to UMP and cytidine to CMP (52, 62, 63) (Fig. 5). dCTP can also
be synthesized from glutamine through the de novo synthesis
pathway, as well (52, 62) (Fig. 5). To determine the importance of
the de novo synthesis pathway to E. chaffeensis infections, we ob-
tained the drug cyclopentenyl cytosine, which inhibits the conver-
sion of [3H]UTP to [3H]CTP (28), as an inhibitor of CTP synthe-
tase (45, 52, 62). The drug effectively inhibits de novo synthesis of
pyrimidines, leaving only the salvage pathway, with cytidine as the
substrate for pyrimidine synthesis. To explore the impact of CPEC
on E. chaffeensis growth, S2 cells were treated with CPEC for 48 h
at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 M. Subsequently, we
infected those cells with E. chaffeensis for an additional 48 h. We
found a signiﬁcant increase in bacterial growth in all of the treated
cells compared to infected cells treated with carrier only (Fig. 6,
solid bars; P  0.01). Similarly, when S2 cells were ﬁrst infected
with E. chaffeensis for 48 h and then treated with different concen-
trations of CPEC for 48 h, we observed signiﬁcant increases in
bacterial growth in cells treated with 10 and 100 M CPEC com-
pared to infected cells treated with carrier only (Fig. 6, cross-
hatched bars; P  0.01). Therefore, the de novo synthesis pathway
was not needed for bacterial growth in the S2 cells and usually
enhanced infection.
Cytosine treatment increases E. chaffeensis infection. Cyto-
sine combines with ribose to form cytidine in the nucleotide sal-
vage pathway. Therefore, to determine if it is an important sub-
strate for bacterial growth, we supplemented S2 cell culture
medium for 24 h with 25 mM cytosine prior to infection with E.
chaffeensis, and bacterial replication was assessed at up to 96 h p.i.
(Fig. 7). The cytosine-treated infected cells contained averages of
FIG 1 Infection of microarray samples by E. chaffeensis. S2 cells with and without LPS treatment were assayed for E. chaffeensis infection after 24 or 96 h;
uninfected S2 cells were also assessed. E. chaffeensis infection was conﬁrmed by assessing the 16S ribosomal RNA as described in Materials and Methods. D.
melanogaster rp49 transcript was used as a loading control.

456%, 1423%, 3,352%, and 2,465% more copies of Ehrlichia 16S
rRNA at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h p.i., respectively, than mock-infected
cells.
Silencing of UCK2 in human THP-1 cells. The uridine-cytidine
kinase UCK2 is a conserved enzyme that is present in humans, as
well as D. melanogaster. Therefore, to examine the contribution of
the enzyme to E. chaffeensis growth in human cells, we used dou-
ble-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to induce UCK2 gene-speciﬁc silenc-
ing to inhibit translation of UCK2. We used three different RNA
duplex sequences to deﬁne the speciﬁcity of the UCK2 knock-
down. THP-1 cells are a promyelocytic cell line that was induced
to differentiate into macrophages for 24 h using phorbol ester.
After being silenced for 48 h, cells were infected with E. chaffeensis.
Three different siRNA duplexes targeted to the UCK2 transcript
consistently inhibited E. chaffeensis growth by 48 h p.i. in the range
of 47 to 69% compared to cells treated with a scrambled control
siRNA (Table 1). We also detected improved E. chaffeensis growth
in cells treated with siRNA for HPRT, which was used as a control
for silencing-procedure effectiveness and to help show the speci-
ﬁcity of the UCK2-speciﬁc duplexes.
Mitochondrial localization around morulae in E. chaffeensis-
infected cells. Mitochondria surround morulae in E. chaffeensis-
infected cells (49). Indeed, when we examined DH82 cells after
infection with E. chaffeensis by TEM, one prominent feature of the
infected cells was the clustering of large numbers of mitochondria
around the morulae (Fig. 8A and B). It even appears that mito-
chondria were closely apposed to bacteria within the parasito-
phorous vacuole (Fig. 8B). This contrasts with the random distri-
bution of mitochondria in uninfected cells (Fig. 8C).
DISCUSSION
We used D. melanogaster to investigate host factors that are im-
portant for the replication of E. chaffeensis. We combined mi-
croarray analysis and mutant ﬂy screening to successfully identify
10 genes that contribute to the replication of E. chaffeensis in vivo.
Seven genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, Ccdc58, and Apop1)
encode proteins that have mitochondrial functions, serve as sub-
strates in the mitochondria, or are associated with proteins with
mitochondrial functions. For example, the Cht11 gene encodes a
glycoside hydrolase with a chitinase active site (43). Cht11 is or-
thologous to the Chitinase 11 gene of Tribolium castaneum, which
has been assigned to a separate classiﬁcation group (group VII)
from other identiﬁed chitinases (3) (Subbaratnam Muthukrish-
nan, Kansas State University, personal communication). This sug-

ﬂies were injected with PBS (o) or bacteria (Œ), and mutant ﬂies were injected
with PBS (Œ) or bacteria (). The data represent means 	 SEM of three or
more independent experiments, with 20 ﬂies per treatment group per experi-
ment. †, survival is signiﬁcantly different from that of E. chaffeensis-infected
wild-type ﬂies; P  0.05 using the log rank test of the Kaplan-Meier plots.

ods. The data represent means 	 SEM of three assessments for Cht11, Uck2,

gests that Cht11 has a function other than those classically de-
scribed for chitinases. A two-hybrid screen associated the protein
with the protein product encoded by Tiny tim 50 (22). Ttm50 (also
known as Tim50) encodes a protein that is part of a transporter
located on the inner mitochondrial membrane (15) (Fig. 9).
Chitins and their derivatives regulate cholesterol when used as diet
supplements (29, 74). Mice with high blood cholesterol had more
severe Anaplasma phagocytophilum (another tick-transmitted
rickettsia pathogen closely related to E. chaffeensis) infections in
their blood, livers, and spleens than mice with normal cholesterol
levels (72). E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum cannot synthe-
size cholesterol, and they scavenge it from host cells during infec-
tions (34). Therefore, Cht11 may function to regulate cholesterol
levels to facilitate infections. Cholesterol can also affect both the
inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and affect ATPase ac-
tivity (10, 19). A human homolog of Cht11 has not been identiﬁed,
but homologs have been identiﬁed in ticks and body lice (43).
Both of these species serve as vectors for several different rickettsia
bacteria (4), and it will be interesting to explore the function of the
gene for the survival of E. chaffeensis and other rickettsial agents in
their respective arthropod hosts.
Several of the genes that impact E. chaffeensis infections encode
key mitochondrial enzymes needed for fatty acid metabolism and
acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) production. The whd gene was origi-
nally associated with uridine kinase (56). However, recent anno-
tation (43) and experimentation (58) have identiﬁed whd as the
palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT 1) gene. Palmitoyltransferase 1 is the
rate-limiting enzyme for palmitoyl-CoA uptake into mitochon-
dria (24) (Fig. 9). Echs1 in Drosophila is an ortholog of the ECHS1
gene in humans and other mammals (43), which encodes an
enoyl-CoA hydratase in the second step of the 
-oxidation path-
way in the mitochondrion (27) (Fig. 9). Therefore, when we ex-
perimentally challenged ﬂies mutant for the Echs1 gene, the im-
mediate downstream effect was on the supply of acetyl-CoA to the
citric acid cycle, which implies that the supply of acetyl-CoA may
be critical to E. chaffeensis replication. san is an ortholog of the
human NAA50 gene, which encodes N(alpha)-acetyltransferase
50 (43). These acetyltransferases are involved in the conversion of
glycerol-3-phosphate to phosphatidic acid (13). This biochemical
step is upstream of the CDP diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) interme-
diate in the synthesis of cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial
membrane. It is also possible that the acetyltransferase could be
active in the 
-oxidation pathway. However, this has yet to be
proven experimentally.
CG15881, or Ccdc58, is an ortholog of the human gene known
as coiled-coil domain-containing protein 58 (CCDC58). Although
the exact function of Ccdc58 is not known, its structure likely
allows it to interact with other coiled-coil molecules (41). Indeed,
the STRING association tool (60) shows that CCDC58 has a direct
relationship with mitochondrial ribosomal protein S28 (MRPS28)
and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 9 homolog
(TIMM9), which encode an inner mitochondrial membrane
chaperone protein, SSBP1, a protein putatively thought to be in-
volved in mitochondrial DNA replication (60). The BioGraph
gene association tool (33) assigned a rank of 23 out of 18,180 gene
concepts (top 0.13%) when it was assigned to “mitochondria.”
Other coiled-coil domain-containing proteins have been associ-
ated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (70), and CCDC58
has also been associated with the mitochondrial single-nucleotide
polymorphisms that impact the progression of AIDS (26). There-
fore, it is highly likely that the impact of disruption of Ccdc58 on E.
chaffeensis growth is due to its impact on mitochondrial function.
CG14806 or Apopt1 has no known function in Drosophila. It is
an ortholog of the Apoptogenic 1 gene (APOPT1 or Apop1) in
humans and rodents (66). It is involved in the release of cyto-

for their sensitivity to infection. The data represent means 	 SEM of 4 or 5

chrome c through permeability transition pores in the outer mem-
brane of the mitochondrion and the activation of apoptosis (59,
73) (Fig. 9). It seems plausible that inhibiting apoptosis would be
to the bacterium’s advantage. There is increased transcription of
some apoptotic genes during Ehrlichia infections (75), and there is
delayed apoptosis in neutrophils after infection with Ehrlichia ew-
ingii (71). It is possible that Apop1 is needed to help in the release
of bacteria at the end of the replicative phase. E. chaffeensis organ-
isms disseminate by lysing host cells or by exocytosis in order to
spread to uninfected cells (17). More empirical analyses will be
needed to support this hypothesis.
Uck2 (CG6364) is orthologous to the mammalian UCK2 gene
with the molecular function of a uridine kinase (43). Functionally,
it has been associated with the phagocytosis of Candida albicans
(57). Using the STRING association tool (60), we found that its
predictedfunctionalpartnersareallinvolvedinnucleotide/nucleo-
side modiﬁcation. These functions include nucleoside di- and
triphosphate activity (CG5276), hydrolase activity (CG8891), uracil

phosphoribosyl transferase activity (CG5537), uridine phosphor-
ylase (CG3788, CG8349), cytidylate/uridylate kinase activity
(Dak1), uridine phosphorylase (CG6330), and cytidine deaminase
activity (CG8349). The BioGraph gene association tool (33) as-
signed a rank of 12.63% (2,297th out of 18,180 gene objects) when
Uck2 was associated with mitochondria, indicating a highly prob-
able association. Cytosine triphosphate, a downstream product of
the uridine kinase (38, 62), is a substrate used for the conversion of
phosphatidic acid to CDP-DAG (31, 46) (Fig. 9). CDP-DAG is
synthesized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is neces-
sary for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a major component of the
inner mitochondrial membrane (46). Therefore, we reason that
the uridine kinase must be essential to providing substrates for E.
chaffeensis, because it cannot be provided by the de novo synthesis
pathway. When we grew E. chaffeensis in the presence of CPEC, a
CTP synthetase inhibitor (52, 62) that inhibits the synthesis of
CTP from glutamate (Fig. 5), bacterial replication was signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the bacterium
does not require the host to use glutamine as a substrate during
replication. Supplementation of cytosine in cells enhanced Ehrli-
chia replication, which further implicates the use of the salvage
pathway through cytidine. The enhanced growth of another rick-
ettsia, Rickettsia felis, from pyrimidines in tryptose phosphate
broth is also consistent with the involvement of mitochondrial
enzymes in obligate intracellular bacterial growth (50). Moreover,
cytidine is the least abundant nucleoside in cells (32). The deple-
tion of cytidine pools can disrupt the balance of ribonucleotides in
cells, leading to alterations in cellular homeostasis and apoptosis
(52). These observations suggest that E. chaffeensis needs to regu-
late cytidine in order to control apoptosis until its replication is
completed within a phagosome.
The enhanced growth of E. chaffeensis after treatment with
CPEC instead of an inhibitory effect suggests that the bacterium
requires the uridine/cytidine salvage pathway to phosphorylate
cytidine and uridine (61) for its replication. More importantly, the
disruption of E. chaffeensis growth in UCK2-silenced THP-1 mac-
rophages reinforces the fact that the UCK2 target has human rel-
evance. Therefore, we focused our attention on Uck2 because it
has the potential to be a target for chemotherapy. UCK2 has been
found to be more active in certain types of cancers (54) and acts to
phosphorylate nucleoside analog drugs used for treatment of can-
cers and hepatitis C virus infections (23, 61). Uninfected host cells
may be unaffected by UCK2 inhibitors, since nucleotides could be
synthesized by the de novo synthesis pathway.
The clustering of mitochondria adjacent to morulae in E.
chaffeensis-infected macrophages supports the hypothesis that it
has physiological relevance and is consistent with previous obser-
vations (37, 49). Mitochondrial membrane permeability and
membrane potential were not disrupted by either E. chaffeensis
(37) or E. ewengii (71) infection. However, Liu et al. found that
mitochondrial biochemical activity was reduced, as evidenced
from the measurement of mitochondrial DNA synthesis or the
transcription of several mitochondrial genes (37). There is also
evidence that the E. chaffeensis type IV secretion system is used to
insert bacterial effector proteins into host mitochondria (36).
These observations suggest that the organism inhibits mitochon-
drial activity, perhaps to inhibit the generation of mitochondrially
produced oxidative products that would be harmful to the bacte-
ria (5, 68). In contrast, we have disrupted several genes that are
associated with mitochondrial function that negatively affect E.

chaffeensis infections. The gene products of san and Uck2 affect
cardiolipin synthesis on the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig.
9). Cht11 encodes protein for part of a transport molecule on the
same inner mitochondrial membrane. The gene products of whd
and Echs1 affect steroidogenesis, ketogenesis, and the Krebs cycle
(Fig. 9), the last of which has clear mitochondrial dependence.
Although Ccdc58 and Apopt1 are associated with mitochondria
(Fig. 9), we have yet to fully understand their signiﬁcance. It is also
interesting that genes like Nup37 and dumpy, which do not have
direct mitochondrial connections, also affect E. chaffeensis infec-
tions. The NUP37 gene product is part of nucleopores. One of the
molecules it transports, glucose, is also important for mitochon-
drial functions. The dumpy gene has been characterized geneti-
cally and appears to impact wing and other body part develop-
ment (11, 12). It has no known mammalian orthologs (43), and
dumpy encodes a large extracellular molecule needed for struc-
tural integrity in wing epithelial tissue (12, 69). Interestingly, one
of the properties listed for dumpy is that it binds iron and sulfur
(43), properties of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidation-
reduction reactions (6). Clearly, more work is necessary to under-
stand these molecules and their host-bacterium interactions. Never-
theless,ourﬁndingsprovidecluesaboutthemitochondrialprocesses
that are needed by the bacteria. Interestingly, at least one alphapro-
teobacterium closely related to Ehrlichia, designated IricES1, infects
the mitochondria of ovarian cells of Ixodes ricinus (7). Perhaps E.
chaffeensis is one step away from a similar symbiotic relationship.

FIG 9 Identiﬁcation of mitochondrion-associated genes that impact E. chaffeensis infection. san [N-(alpha) acetyltransferase 50] and Uck2 (uridine/cytidine
kinase) are needed for the synthesis of cardiolipin. Phosphatidic acid (PA), a product of san activity, and CTP, which is produced from CMP, a product of Uck2,
are both necessary substrates for biosynthesis of cardiolipin, the major inner mitochondrial membrane lipid. Cht11 (chitinase 11) encodes part of a protein
transporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane. whd (withered) encodes carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and Echs1 encodes enoyl-CoA hydratase; both
enzymes are needed for the production of acetyl-CoA. Ccdc58 encodes coiled-coil domain-containing protein 58, which is found in complex with the inner
mitochondrial membrane molecules MRPS28 and SSBP1. Apopt1 (Apoptogenic 1) induces the release of cytochrome c through the permeability transition pore
and triggers apoptosis. Nup37 (Nucleoporin 37) is not found in the mitochondrion but is part of a nucleopore complex that transports hexose molecules,
including glucose, an important molecule in energy metabolism.
