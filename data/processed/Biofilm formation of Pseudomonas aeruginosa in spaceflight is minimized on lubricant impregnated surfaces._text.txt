The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial bioﬁlms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to
astronauts’ health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand bioﬁlms’ behavior in microgravity. As
part of the Space Bioﬁlms project, bioﬁlms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in spaceﬂight over material surfaces. Stainless
Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceﬂight hardware components, while a lubricant
impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential bioﬁlm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of bioﬁlms were
characterized. Bioﬁlms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits bioﬁlm formation compared to SS.
Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceﬂight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use.
Transcriptomic proﬁles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of bioﬁlm reduction on LIS are
discussed.

INTRODUCTION
In previous and current spaces stations (Salyut-6 and -7, Mir, and
the International Space Station (ISS)), damage caused by bacterial
bioﬁlms on hardware have resulted in function disruption and
failures of myriad equipment (summarized in Zea et al., 2018,
20201,2). On the ISS, bioﬁlms are a concern for the water recovery
system, particularly for the water processing assembly’s waste-
water tank and its downstream ﬁlter3,4, as well as for the hoses
linking the distillation assembly to the purge and ﬂuid pumps,
which have needed to be returned to Earth for unclogging and
reprocessing before sent back to ISS (Y.A. Velez-Justiniano,
personal communication, June 10, 2022).
Bioﬁlms are communities of microbes attached to each other
and to surfaces which can cause damage to materials either
directly by using it as food, or indirectly via their metabolic
byproducts5,6. While pre-planned bioﬁlms may enable useful
processes in space7–9, uncontrolled growth—especially of oppor-
tunistic or pathogenic microbes—may have another deleterious
effect for space missions: increased risk of infections to the crew.
Microbial communities living as bioﬁlms can have increased
tolerance to disinfectants and antibiotics10, which may contribute
to recurrent infections. On Earth, bioﬁlms are associated with 65%
and 80% of infectious and chronic diseases, respectively11.
Materials can profoundly inﬂuence bioﬁlm growth, and it is
possible to design surfaces that either prevent microbial adhesion
or that have antimicrobial properties. Antimicrobial surfaces
include those with metallic nanoparticles with biocidal effects12
and strongly oxidizing materials that destroy cell membranes13.
However, biocidal surfaces have a critical failure mechanism when
a layer of destroyed cells forms on the initial surface. This layer can
provide a safe harbor for new microbes to colonize. Preventing
initial adhesion of microbes via engineering of surface properties
addresses this limitation. Surface roughness provides initial
colonizers with favorable positions to adhere to a surface, and
therefore smooth surfaces tend to be more successful at
preventing adhesion14. Hydrophobicity is another property that
is particularly focused on in the context of creating adhesion-free
surfaces; however, the inﬂuence is a complicated one. In general,
hydrophobic surfaces may cause greater initial attachment due to
hydrophobic interactions between the surface and the cell
membranes, but also allow larger detachment rates14.
The fast pace of microbial adaptation and changes in gene
expression also presents a signiﬁcant challenge for creation of
anti-biofouling materials. Microorganism behavior is signiﬁcantly
altered by the presence of different surfaces. For example, bioﬁlm
morphologies differ strongly across steel and polypropylene
surfaces15, and gene expression is altered for microbes exposed
to less habitable surfaces16,17. Therefore, even surfaces engineered
to resist bioﬁlms may not be immune to bacteria colonization.
Bioﬁlm growth in space stations and surface habitat compo-
nents can decrease the probability of mission success and increase
that of medical risks to the crew. Crewed missions to the Lunar
surface and Mars, the latter requiring several years in space,
warrant understanding of how bioﬁlms grow differently in
microgravity, as system functionality is of even higher importance
when receiving spare parts from Earth or returning crew to Earth
promptly is not possible. To address this, the NASA-funded Space
Bioﬁlms project was designed as described in Zea et al. 20181, and
prepared and performed on board the ISS as reported in Flores
et al., 202218. In brief, samples of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-
PA14 (PA14) were sent to the ISS and bioﬁlms were allowed to
grow on different surfaces for either one, two, or three days at
37 °C. Equivalent bioﬁlms grown on Earth at 1 g were used as
controls. The six material surfaces tested were stainless steel 316
(SS316), passivated SS316 (pSS316), a silicon wafer impregnated
with silicone oil as a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS)19,
cellulose membrane, silicone, and silicone with a microtopogra-
phy. Each condition tested had four replicates ﬁxed in 4% PFA for
morphology analysis, and other four preserved in RNAlater for
gene expression analysis. Here, we report the morphological and

transcriptomic results of SS316, pSS316, and LIS grown in nutrient-
rich medium (to replicate wastewater); the rest are reported
elsewhere20.
SS316 and pSS316 were assessed given their common use for
spacecraft components and for elements of the Environmental
Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), respectively. LIS was
tested as a potential alternative for future spacecraft parts most
susceptible to bioﬁlm formation.
SS316 is an iron alloy containing chromium, nickel, and
molybdenum characteristic for its increased resistance to corro-
sion compared to iron21. The passivation of SS316 uses a nitric or
citric acid treatment to eliminate iron from the surface and
generate an oxide passive layer to prevent corrosion22. LISs are a
class of textured surfaces that are stably impregnated with a
lubricant (e.g., oils) to render the surface with super-slippery
properties19,23 (Fig. 1). The lubricant is held within the texture by
capillary and intermolecular forces. A drop on LIS can exist in one
of twelve different thermodynamic states depending on the
properties of the solid texture, lubricant, droplet, and environ-
ment. Stable impregnation of the lubricant requires the contact
angle of the lubricant on solid surface to be below a critical value
set by the texture parameters. For the case of stable LIS, the
texture tops can remain exposed or covered by a thin van der
Waals lubricant ﬁlm depending on the spreading coefﬁcient of the
lubricant on the solid surface (in the presence of droplet phase). A
detailed discussion of the thermodynamic states, stable impreg-
nation criteria, and droplet mobility are provided in Smith et al.
(2013)19. Because a signiﬁcant portion of the surface texture can
stay submerged in the lubricant (except for texture tops) for stable
LIS, these surfaces can achieve signiﬁcant reduction in adhesion
and

RESULTS
The biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage of bioﬁlms
formed on SS316 were not statistically different from those of
bioﬁlms grown on pSS316 (α = 0.05) at any incubation day
(Supplementary Figure 1 and raw data in Supplementary Table 1).
Similarly, no morphological differences were observed between
bioﬁlms formed on the two materials (Supplementary Figure 2) for
either Earth-based or microgravity cultures. In addition, there were
no differentially expressed genes (DEG) between SS316 and
pSS316 bioﬁlms in any conditions tested (α = 0.05) except for
microgravity day 2 where pSS316 had 44 DEG (Supplementary
Table 2). Based on this, SS316 and pSS316 were pooled into one
“SS” data set which is hereon compared and contrasted to that of
bioﬁlms formed on LIS.
Bioﬁlm morphology and observations from the liquid cultures
In 1 g, bioﬁlms on SS grew throughout the surface with no marked
boundaries, usually creating conglomerates that formed ‘mounts’
of bioﬁlm with dispersed single cells in between (Fig. 2a).
Conversely, the few bioﬁlms grown on LIS were restricted to
certain areas with sharp edges, had a more compact appearance,
and looked thicker (not signiﬁcant) than those grown on SS (Fig.
2b). In addition, the LIS surface showed individual cells or small
multiple cell groups attached in random isolated areas and a thin
layer of nucleic acids in the areas where there was no bioﬁlm.
Bacterial cells attached on LIS were often found growing in the
perimeter or inside of a circle (as seen for 1-day-old bioﬁlms on
1 g) as well as small, connected clusters. Overall, bioﬁlms on LIS
seemed to be restricted to grow in smaller areas than on SS.
The morphology of bioﬁlms formed on SS in space was similar
to that of the Earth controls, in that the space samples also
exhibited a lack of clear boundaries and bioﬁlm ‘mounts’ were also
observed, albeit with bigger gaps between them (Fig. 2c). Bioﬁlms
grown on LIS in microgravity did not form as many sharp,
compact, and thick bioﬁlms (only a few in smaller size) compared
to those formed in 1 g (Fig. 2d). The thickness of these smaller
bioﬁlms decreased in time (p < 0.001). Most of the surface of LIS
was covered with a thin layer of nucleic acids (red signal from the
propidium iodide (PI) stain). The PI did not partition to LIS’s
silicone oil in the absence of bacteria, nor did the Green Bioﬁlm
stain (green signal to label lipids) (Fig. 2e) conﬁrming that the
signal on the bioﬁlm samples corresponds to adsorbed nucleic
acids on LIS’s surface.
The PA14 liquid cultures in which the coupons were submerged
became more turbid (turbidity correlation with viable cell count
available in Supplementary Figure 3) for the microgravity set than
for the 1 g controls (not signiﬁcant for SS day 1 and SS day 2).
Speciﬁcally, for the samples cultured for three days, when OD600 in
microgravity had an increase of 41.3% for SS (p = 2.9e−08) and
23.4% for LIS (p = 0.0204) (Supplementary Figure 4 and raw data
in Supplementary Table 3). In addition, it is worth noting that the
color of the liquid culture changed as well. In microgravity, the

cultures were light green on day 1, light brown on day 2, and light
pink on day 3, while the ground cultures remained clear for days 1
and 2 and then turned light yellow on day 3 (Supplementary
Figure 5). The increased culture turbidity in microgravity could
suggest more bacterial growth in general; however, microgravity
bioﬁlms exhibited the opposite trend.
Bioﬁlm biomass, thickness, and surface coverage
PA14 bioﬁlms formed in microgravity had signiﬁcantly lower
(p ≤0.05) biomass (Fig. 3), and thickness (Fig. 4) than those
formed at 1 g. This is true for both SS and LIS, the only exception
being for the bioﬁlms formed on LIS at one day of incubation,
which exhibited no difference between gravitational regimes. In
the case of SS, by day 3 bioﬁlms formed in microgravity had only
17.6% and 53.6% of the ground control biomass and thickness,
respectively. The same phenomenon was observed on LIS, where
bioﬁlms formed in space had 8.7% and 21.3% of the ground
control biomass and thickness. Furthermore, bioﬁlms formed in
space covered signiﬁcantly less surface than their 1 g counter-
parts (31.4% and 33.0% of surface area for SS and LIS,
respectively) (Fig. 5). The median values for the three parameters
assessed are summarized in Table 1 and the raw data in
Supplementary Table 4.
The SS and LIS bioﬁlms on 1 g appeared to grow in size with
time, with the largest growth observed between day 1 and day 2
(Figs. 2a, b, 3, 4, 5). This trend also held true for SS in microgravity;
although with a lower growth rate (Figs. 2c, 3, 4, 5). For bioﬁlms on
LIS in microgravity, there was little to no change in mass and
surface area coverage as a function of time.
Bioﬁlms grown on SS were signiﬁcantly different than bioﬁlms
grown on LIS in terms of mass and surface area coverage. On both
Earth and in microgravity, at day 3, the median of biomass and

Second row per material is a volume view of the complete z-stack image. Images correspond to bioﬁlms grown in 1 g over a SS and b LIS, or

stains, are presented in panel (e). Scale bars are 20 µm. Bioﬁlms form without boundaries on SS while on LIS they have sharp edges. Bioﬁlms
had signiﬁcantly reduced surface area coverage on LIS, especially in microgravity where bioﬁlms were minimized and mostly present as small
groups of cells. The thin layer of nucleic acids on LIS surface could be DNA, RNA, or both as PI does not differentiate between them.

surface area coverage in LIS was signiﬁcantly lower (p ≤0.001)
than in SS bioﬁlms (Table 1).
Gene expression of bioﬁlms in microgravity vs bioﬁlms on 1 g
Bacteria adapt to their environment through gene expression
modulation. The mechanisms used by bacteria to adapt to
changes can be observed in their transcriptomic proﬁle. The
following paragraphs compare 3-day-old bioﬁlms formed in
microgravity against matched Earth controls (baseline) for either
SS or LIS surfaces. When available, the PAO1 ortholog gene
numbers are listed in the brackets at the ﬁrst mention of the
corresponding PA14 gene.
For SS, bioﬁlms showed ﬁve DEG in microgravity with a fold
change ≥2 (Fig. 6a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 5). Three
had increased expression (rsmY [PA0527.1], rmf [PA3049], pchB
[PA4230]), and the remaining two had decreased expression in
microgravity (PA14_63220 [PA4782], PA14_21970 [PA3249]). A
KEGG pathways enrichment analysis was performed to under-
stand at a bigger scale the more subtle changes (including the <2-
fold changes) caused by microgravity (Supplementary Figure 6).
No signiﬁcant enrichments were found with >2-fold, but it showed
the “nitrogen metabolism” pathway enriched (Supplementary
Figure 7) in the space samples (1.02-fold). In addition, analyses
were focused on genes involved in P. aeruginosa virulence and
antimicrobial resistance. Despite pchB (2.2-fold) being the only
gene in the virulome differentially expressed >2-fold, the other
ﬁve genes involved in pyochelin production also had signiﬁcant
increased expression in microgravity for bioﬁlms grown over SS
(Fig. 6c): pchI (1.4-fold) [PA4222], pchE (1.9-fold) [PA4226], pchD
(1.5-fold) [PA4228], pchC (1.9-fold) [PA4229], and fptA (1.8-fold)
[PA4221]. There was no signiﬁcant effect >2-fold in the resistome.
For
LIS,
bioﬁlms
in
microgravity
had
only
one
DEG
–
PA14_08190 (−6.4-fold, raw data in Supplementary Table 6)—
which codes for a hypothetical protein. This suggests that bioﬁlms
on Earth and in space formed over LIS have virtually the same
transcriptome. Futures tests in microgravity should conﬁrm if this
holds true at the protein level and should consider studying the
function of PA14_08190.
Gene expression of bioﬁlms on LIS vs bioﬁlms on SS
The following paragraphs describe the results of the gene
expression analyses performed to compare 3-day-old bioﬁlms
grown on LIS with respect to 3-day-old bioﬁlms grown on SS
(baseline). The ﬁrst paragraph focuses on results under Earth’s
gravity and the second paragraph for results in microgravity.
On Earth, bioﬁlms grown on LIS had 310 DEG with a fold change
≥2 (Fig. 7a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 7) when compared
to SS bioﬁlms. The top ﬁve DEG were PA14_09380 [PA4218], pchC,
PA14_06170 [PA1911], PA14_52500 [PA0909], and pchE; all with
increased expression on LIS. Gene PA14_52500 is annotated as
coding for a hypothetical protein and had the highest fold change
(3.9) of all. Some of the genes that code for alginate production
had signiﬁcantly increased expression on LIS (below 2-fold): mucB
(1.2-fold) [PA0764], mucD (1.1-fold) [PA0766], algR (1.5-fold)
[PA5261], mucE (1.9-fold) [PA4033], mucP (1.4-fold) [PA3649]. The
pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 8) showed
the “carbon metabolism” pathway as the most enriched on LIS
(1.1-fold) (Supplementary Figure 9). On Earth, the virulome
presented several genes of Hcp secretion island I (HSI-I), type
three secretion systems (TTSS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and
pyocyanin with decreased expression in LIS with respect to SS
(Fig. 7c). Conversely, almost all the genes involved in synthesis of
pyochelin had increased expression on LIS (>2.5-fold): pchI (3.1-

fold), pchH (2.6-fold) [PA4223], pchG (2.7-fold) [PA4224], pchF (3.1-
fold) [PA4225], pchE (3.1-fold), pchD (2.5-fold), pchC (3.1-fold), pchB
(3.2-fold), pchA (3.0-fold) [PA4231], fptA (2.6-fold). In the resistome,
gene nouJ [PA2645] had 2.2-fold increased expression on LIS. In
addition, genes involved in apoptosis were differentially expressed
on LIS bioﬁlms, rpoS [PA3622] had increased expression (2.4-fold)
and the antitoxins higA [PA4674] and PA14_21720 [PA2489] had
decreased expression (−1.4 and −2.4-fold, respectively).
In microgravity, bioﬁlms grown on LIS had 425 DEG with a fold
change >2 (Fig. 8a, b, raw data in Supplementary Table 8) when
compared to SS. The top ﬁve DEG were PA14_27520 (−5.5-fold)
[PA2826], PA14_44920 (−3.1-fold) [PA1509], PA14_20060 (3.7-
fold), PA14_51580 (−4.0-fold), and estA (3.1-fold) [PA5112]. Three
of these top ﬁve DEG code for hypothetical proteins that have not
been characterized. In microgravity, no pathways were signiﬁ-
cantly enriched or depleted for LIS vs SS. Interestingly, the
observations made on the virulome when comparing LIS with SS
on Earth, remain true for bioﬁlms on LIS in microgravity: HSI-I,
TTSS, LPS, and pyocyanin-synthesis associated genes had reduced
expression while genes associated with pyochelin and rhamno-
lipids had increased expression (Fig. 8c) with respect to SS. There
was no increased expression of alginate-associated genes on LIS in
microgravity, which differs to what was seen on Earth. In
microgravity, the resistome of bioﬁlms on LIS had increased
expression
of mexT
(2.3-fold)
[PA2492] and
galU
(2.1-fold)
[PA2023], and decreased expression of ampD (−3.1) [PA4522].
Finally, when comparing LIS with respect to SS, no signiﬁcant
differences in gene expression of rpoS or higA were observed in
microgravity, but one putative toxin (PA14_28120 [PA2781])
presented a 1.4-fold increased expression. Shared DEG in both
gravitational regimes of bioﬁlms on LIS with respect to SS at day 3
presented in Supplementary Table 9.
Gene expression of 3-day-old bioﬁlms vs 1-day-old bioﬁlms
Changes in the transcriptome between 3- and 1-day-old bioﬁlms
provide insight into the bioﬁlm formation process. The following
paragraphs describe the results of the gene expression analyses
performed to compare bioﬁlms grown on SS for 3 days with
respect to bioﬁlms grown on SS for 1 day (baseline). The ﬁrst
paragraph focuses on results under Earth’s gravity and the second
paragraph for results in microgravity.
On Earth, 3-day-old bioﬁlms exhibited 115 DEG with fold
change
>2
(Supplementary
Figure
10a,
10b,
raw
data
in
Supplementary Table 10) with respect to 1-day-old bioﬁlms. The
top ﬁve DEG at day three had decreased expression (PA14_40310
[PA1869], trxB2 [PA0849], PA14_39700, PA14_10380 [PA4139], nirN
[PA0509]). PA14_10380, the most differentially expressed (−5.2-
fold), codes for a hypothetical protein. With respect to day one,
day three had increased expression of several genes involved in
production of Psl extracellular matrix polysaccharide, in particular
pslO (3.1-fold) [PA2245]. The pathways enrichment analysis
(Supplementary Figure 11) showed several depleted pathways at
day three; “sulfur relay system” was the most depleted (−2.0-fold)
(Supplementary Figure 12), followed by “nitrogen metabolism”
(−1.7-fold) (Supplementary Figure 13). In the virulome of day
three (Supplementary Figure 10c) there was a reduction in
expression of genes in the Las (lasA −2.2-fold [PA1871], lasB
−2.3-fold [PA3724]) and Rhl systems (rhlA −2.3-fold [PA3479], rhlB
−2.2-fold [PA3478]), and of gene algP/algR3 (−2.1-fold) involved
in alginate synthesis. Regarding the resistome on Earth, day three
presented decreased expression of genes that code for RND efﬂux
pumps and outer membrane proteins: mexH (−2.1-fold) [PA4206],
ompA (−2.6-fold) [PA3692], opmD (−2.3-fold) [PA4208].
In microgravity, 3-day-old bioﬁlms showed 70 DEG with fold
change ≥2 (Supplementary Figure S14a, S14b, raw data in

top ﬁve DEG at day three correspond to: PA14_40310 (−2.6-fold),
malQ (−3.1-fold) [PA2163], PA14_36650 (−3.7-fold) [PA2159],
PA14_72370 (−5.1-fold) [PA5482] and pchF (3.2-fold). Again, the
most differentially (under)expressed gene (PA14_72370) codes for
a hypothetical protein. There was no systemic increased expres-
sion of extracellular matrix polysaccharides on day three in
microgravity, but as on the ground, the gene trxB2 (−2.3-fold) and
the cytochrome c gene cluster (including nirN −2.1-fold) had
decreased expression. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supple-
mentary Figure 15) showed three depleted pathways at day three
in microgravity; “Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism” is the
most depleted (−2.0-fold) (Supplementary Figure 16). In the
virulome (Supplementary Figure 14c), rhlA (−2.2-fold) was less
expressed on day three (as seen on Earth) while all pyochelin-
associated genes had increased expression (pchI 2.1-fold, pchH
2.4-fold, pchG 3.5-fold, pchF 3.2-fold, pchE 3.2-fold, pchR 1.3-fold
[PA4227], pchD 2.6-fold, pchC 2.8-fold, pchB 3.3-fold, pchA 3.5-fold,
fptA 2.5-fold). In the resistome, ompA (−2.4-fold) showed a
reduced expression on day three in microgravity, as seen in the
ground samples.
DISCUSSION
In this experiment, bioﬁlm shape and general structure appear-
ance was not affected by gravitational regime. Contrary to what
has been previously reported for anaerobic P. aeruginosa PA14
bioﬁlm growth in space31, we observed less robust bioﬁlms in

terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage in
microgravity with respect to 1 g. In microgravity, the increased
expression of rmf, in charge of ribosomal hibernation32 during
stationary phase33, could be indicative of a substrate-limited and
byproduct-abundant extracellular environment for bioﬁlms over
SS, as the one theorized to occur in microgravity for non-motile
planktonic cells34,35. Such an environment could be partially
attributed to the increased planktonic cell growth in microgravity,
increasing
the
accumulation
of
metabolic
byproducts
and
depletion of nutrients, and potentially the cause of reduced
bioﬁlm formation. Proteomic analysis and functional analysis are
needed to conﬁrm these hypotheses.
Starvation environmental conditions can trigger bioﬁlm dis-
persal in P. aeruginosa36,37. However, the genes known to be
involved
in
bioﬁlm
dispersion38—dipA
[PA5017]39,40,
rbdA
[PA0861]41,
nbdA
[PA3311]42,43,
gcbA
[PA4843]44,
and
bdlA
[PA1423]39—were not differentially expressed in microgravity.
Thus, bioﬁlm dispersal could be regulated by other gene(s) in
microgravity. Potentially, the increased planktonic growth and
decreased bioﬁlm formation are not a consequence of bioﬁlm
dispersion.
For SS, the most DEG in microgravity was rsmY. RsmY (small
non-coding RNA) controls broad gene expression in P. aeruginosa
through the sequestering of RsmA (gene repressor)45. RsmA
targets the mRNAs of genes mvaT [PA4315], pchB, pchC, pchD, and
pchE46 and, those genes demonstrated increased expression in
microgravity. We hypothesize that RsmY could be regulating some
of the biggest transcriptional changes observed in bioﬁlms grown
over SS in microgravity. It is worth nothing that DEG PA14_63220
and PA14_21970 code for a hypothetical protein and a transcrip-
tional regulator, respectively, that have not yet been characterized
and whose functions could shed light to the changes observed in
microgravity. Moreover, this could be speciﬁc for bioﬁlms growing
on SS, only for bioﬁlms past microcolony stages, or both, as
bioﬁlms on LIS did not have increased expression of rsmY in
microgravity.
Our results suggest potential increased virulence of PA14 3-day-
old bioﬁlms on SS in microgravity through increased expression of
pyochelin. Pyochelin is secreted to chelate iron for bacterial use47
and the outer membrane receptor, FptA, internalizes it. In
addition, pyochelin production in bioﬁlms is characteristic of
aggressive and chronic infections48,49. Proteomic tests should
conﬁrm these results at protein level and on different surfaces.
The green, brown, and pink colors of the liquid culture in
microgravity could be attributed to the production of pigmented
virulence factors such as pyoverdine (green-brown to green-

yellow), pyorubin (red), pyocyanin (deep blue), pyomelanin
(black)50.
It
appears
that
P.
aeruginosa
had
an
increased
production of pyoverdine in the ﬁrst days which then transitioned
to an increased production of pyorubin. Interestingly bioﬁlms in
microgravity had no increased expression of pyoverdine, so the
green-brown color in the liquid culture could be attributed to a
higher production of this virulence factor by the planktonic cells.
On the other hand, the pink color, possibly reﬂecting the
production of pyorubin, could not be assessed as the genes
involved in pyorubin production have not been identiﬁed in PA14,
to our knowledge. These hypotheses need to be conﬁrmed with
transcriptomics
and
proteomics
analyses
of
the
planktonic
cultures
in
future
experiments.
Nevertheless,
the
potential
increased production of pigmented virulence factors of P.
aeruginosa PA14 planktonic cells in microgravity, when grown in
nutrient-rich medium, may pose a health risk for infections
in space.
Remarkably, LIS’s bioﬁlm inhibition on Earth, was even greater
in microgravity. Not only were biomass and surface area
minimized, but these parameters stayed almost constant in time
for microgravity bioﬁlms on LIS. Coupled with the signiﬁcant
bioﬁlm thickness reduction in time in microgravity, contrary to the
increasing thickness trend on Earth, LIS performance in space
makes it suitable to reduce bioﬁlm formation in spacecraft
components. Previous studies with different LISs show that this
type of surfaces greatly reduce the attachment of both gram-
positive
and
gram-negative
bacteria
(including
P.
aerugi-
nosa)25,51–55. The liquid-like properties of LISs are believed to be
the essential for the bacterial attachment inhibition56. Interest-
ingly, bioﬁlm formation on LIS was observed only in areas without
the nucleic acid layer. We hypothesize that the thin layer of
nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both) contributes to attachment
inhibition.
Nucleic acids have a hydrophilic phosphate backbone (nega-
tively charged), and hydrophobic nitrogen bases57–59. It is possible
that the interface between liquid culture and oil layer provided an
ideal zone for DNA/RNA interaction, leading to their immobiliza-
tion on the surface. It is well-established that oil/water interfaces
can capture protein and nucleic acids60; and in some cases, the
surface forces are strong enough to denature proteins60–67.
Characterization of the protein adsorption/denaturing process
on oil-infused textured surfaces, as LIS, remains to be done68,69.
Thus, we hypothesize that the oil/water interface forces could be
enough
to
destabilize
extracellular
DNA
(eDNA),
inducing
conformational changes that result in its unzipping to ssDNA70,
and that the DNA-associated proteins can be denatured to expose
the DNA charges. Such that the hydrophobic portions of DNA/RNA
partition into the oil of the LIS, leaving the hydrophilic phosphate
backbone facing toward the aqueous culture. The mechanism of
nucleic acid adsorption onto LIS surface and the exact composi-
tion of this layer remains to be elucidated and more tests are
needed to conﬁrm this hypothesis.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (negatively charged due to its LPS)
could be repelled by the phosphates of the nucleic acid layer (Fig.
9). Recent studies show reduced attachment of P. aeruginosa on
surfaces with covalently attached and adsorbed DNA71, and on
surfaces with DNA-poly(ethyleneimine) multilayers72. Staphylococ-
cus was also repelled by multilayer chitosan-DNA coatings73. This
hypothesis implies that DNA/RNA was released by the planktonic
cells and attached to LIS early in the experiment. On LIS, bioﬁlm’s
reduced expression of LPS-related genes (on Earth and in
microgravity) and increased expression of alginate (only on
Earth)—a secreted polyanionic polysaccharide that helps mask
LPS’s charge—could be related to the presence of nucleic acid
repulsion forces.
In solid abiotic surfaces, the deposition of eDNA is required for
initial microcolony formation in P. aeruginosa bioﬁlms74–77. The
eDNA is located in the active migration zone of the bioﬁlm and
plays a role in its expansion78. Thus, the nucleic acid layer on LIS
could represent a risk of delayed/increased bioﬁlm formation for
long term. However, it is possible that the orientation and
immobilization of DNA/RNA plays a role in adhesion inhibition. In
addition, the physics of bacterial interactions at interfaces
(specially oil/water interfaces) is unclear and can differ from usual
bioﬁlm formation79. More tests with longer incubation periods are
needed to determine the time limit (if any) of the observed bioﬁlm
inhibition on LIS.
Although LIS is typically stable, it is possible that protein/RNA
acted as a surfactant and led to destabilization of the oil80. The
bioﬁlm increased expression of rhlC in microgravity could have
resulted in increased rhamnolipid (biosurfactants)81 production,
contributing to such destabilization. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa
planktonic cells in microgravity have been reported to produce
larger amounts of rhamnolipids and this could be the case for
bioﬁlms on LIS as well82.
The gene expression analysis of bioﬁlms formed on LIS with
respect to SS suggests several other hypotheses of mechanisms
contributing to the reduced bioﬁlm formation: (1) Increased
expression of pyochelin genes (on Earth and in microgravity) and
of rhamnolipid genes (only on Earth), which are produced in
nitrogen-limited environments83, could reﬂect exacerbated nutri-
ent depletion in the extracellular environment of LIS bioﬁlms in
comparison with SS. It is possible that the lubricant oil could be
self-spreading over the bioﬁlms19 and thereby limiting nutrient
transport. (2) Increased expression of rhamnolipid genes, includ-
ing estA, an esterase that promotes rhamnolipid production84.
Rhamnolipids sometimes lead to bioﬁlm detachment83. (3)
Increased apoptosis as observed in previous spaceﬂight studies34.
Apoptosis of bioﬁlms on LIS could be mediated by the increased
expression of rpoS on Earth (global stress regulator), under-
expression of antitoxins on Earth (higA, PA14_21720) or increased
expression of toxins in microgravity (PA14_28120) with respect to
SS. We acknowledge that transcriptome changes are not direct

evidence of protein levels nor cell functions, and that more tests
are needed to conﬁrm these hypotheses.
It is important to consider that growing bioﬁlms over LIS could
affect virulence and antimicrobial resistance. However, predicting
such an effect is complicated as there is gene expression evidence
for increasing and decreasing effects compared to SS. On one side,
bioﬁlms on LIS had increased expression of the virulence factors
pyochelin and rhamnolipids. On the other side, bioﬁlms on LIS
presented a general decreased expression of type 6 secretion
systems from the HSI-I loci, which could make them less capable
of establishing chronic infections85.
LIS seems to prevent the ﬁrst stage of bioﬁlm formation: cell
attachment. Nevertheless, more tests and analysis are needed to
fully understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. In
parallel, elucidating the functions of the uncharacterized genes
that were differentially expressed on LIS with respect to SS can
provide further insight. Based on the minimized bioﬁlm formation
on LIS in microgravity, it presents itself as a good option for use in
spacecraft components. In addition, the use of directly immobi-
lized DNA/RNA over surfaces (e.g., using covalent bonding,
physical adsorption, or streptavidin-biotin immobilization86,87)
should also be explored to reduce bacterial attachment and
bioﬁlm formation in susceptible spacecraft components.
Bioﬁlms on LIS in microgravity seemed to remain in the
microcolony stage for days 2 and 3, which could explain the
limited differential gene expression between 1-day-old bioﬁlms
and 3-day-old bioﬁlms. 3-day-old SS bioﬁlm gene expression
proﬁle suggests a potential decrease in metabolic activity
(reduced nitrogen metabolism) and quorum sensing signaling
(reduced expression of Las and Rhl systems) with respect to 1-day-
old bioﬁlms. Further tests are needed to conﬁrm such hypothesis
but it agrees with SS bioﬁlm morphology, as expression of these
systems decreases as bioﬁlm height increases88.
Bacterial growth dynamics can differ in space with respect to
behavior observed on Earth89. Hence, it must be noted that
comparing bacterial cultures and bioﬁlms from a given moment in
time (e.g., “day 3”) may be doing so at different stages of growth,
e.g., in a gravitational condition it may still be at the end of
exponential phase while at another it may already be stationary.
Acknowledging
the
limitation
of
getting
data
from
three
instantaneous moments in time in our experiment, we recom-
mend that future studies (i) acquire continuous data as possible,
and (ii) also characterize the growth stage and gene expression of
the planktonic cell culture. Staining protocols may be improved
with the use of a third dye to target polysaccharides. Furthermore,
future studies may interrogate our observations further by
determining the precise composition of the nucleic acid layer
observed on LIS. Future studies, namely those focused on
spacecraft water processing assemblies may improve on the
ﬁdelity of their study by using Ersatz Wastewater formulation to
replicate the wastewater as received on the ISS’ system, extend
the duration of the experiment to multiples of months as
applicable, and the substrate material may be changed to that
of the speciﬁc component being studied.

Proposed mechanism contributing to bioﬁlm inhibition on LIS surface. Both bacteria and nucleic acids possess a negative charge.
a When the nucleic acids get immobilized on the LIS surface, this creates a layer of negatively charged molecules that can repel bacteria
through ionic forces. b Bacteria can attach to areas of the LIS where there is a gap in the oil coat, previously destabilized. c Bioﬁlms form in
these gap areas but grow with sharp edges due to the repulsive forces on the borders.

METHODS
Reagents and hardware
The reagents and hardware were prepared as described in Flores
et al. (2022)18. In brief, the PBS was prepared with PBS pellets
(Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P4417) and autoclaved. The 1X LBK medium
was LB Lennox (Sigma, Cat. L3022) supplemented with 0.86%
potassium nitrate (Sigma, Cat. P8291) and ﬁlter sterilized with
0.22 µm ﬁlters (Nalgene, Cat. 566-0020). LBK medium was
prepared at 1.18X concentration to load in the hardware to
account for dilution during experiment activation. The 11.4% PFA
solution was prepared by diluting 16% PFA (Alfa Aesar, Cat. 43368)
with PBS. When mixed with the sample it yields a ﬁnal
concentration
of
4%
PFA.
The
RNAlater
(Invitrogen,
Cat.
AM7021) was refrigerated prior to loading it in the hardware to
induce the formation of RNAlater crystals. These crystals were then
pulverized and the RNAlater was loaded cold into the hardware.
Preemptive formation and pulverization of the RNAlater crystals
avoided the formation of long crystals during launch (4 °C) that
could cause sample loss, early activation, and leaks by displacing
the hardware chambers. After sample incubation, the RNAlater
was still efﬁcient at preserving RNA from bioﬁlms18.
BioServe’s FPA housed in the Group Activation Pack (GAP) were
used as both ground and ﬂight sample hardware. The FPA
hardware components were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox,
Cat. 1201-1), coated with sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. SL2), and
dried at 100 °C for 30 min to siliconize the glass and facilitate
sample assembly.
Bacterial strain and Inoculum
All the bioﬁlm experiments were performed using Pseudomonas
aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 strain, which was kindly provided by Dr.
George O’Toole. This strain was selected for the project to
replicate the column-and-canopy bioﬁlm structure previously
observed in microgravity by Kim et al. (2013)31 when growing
PA14 bioﬁlms over cellulose membrane. The results of the bioﬁlms
grown over cellulose membrane are reported in a separate
publication20.
The bacterial inoculum was prepared with 6 ml of LBK media
inoculated with PA14 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h (ﬁnal OD595
0.706). The overnight inoculum was diluted 1:100 with PBS (ﬁnal
OD595 0.001) to maintain cells in stasis. The diluted inoculum was
used to load the second chamber of FPAs.
Test surface preparation
Bioﬁlms were grown on 1 cm2 material coupons of SS316 (MPPR-
311-6), pSS316, and LIS. SS316 coupons were cleaned with 1%
Liquinox (Alconox Cat. 1201-1). For the pSS316, clean SS316
coupons were passivated with citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. C-
8385). Preparation of LIS coupons (silicon wafer impregnated with
silicone oil) has been described in detail previously1,18,19. LIS
coupons were not cleaned, to avoid removing the silicone oil, but
they were prepared in sterile conditions. LIS’s silicone oil layer
(0.5–1.5 µm in thickness) has no bactericidal nor growth boost
effect on P. aeruginosa PA1418.
Sample preparation
A total of 144 samples were prepared, 72 for ﬂight and 72 for
corresponding ground controls. All coupons were prepared in the
same fashion. Each gravitational condition tested three material
surfaces (SS316, pSS316, and LIS), three bioﬁlm incubation times
(1, 2, or 3 days), and two termination reagents (PFA for
morphology analysis and RNAlater for transcriptomics) with four
replicates per condition. Flight samples were sent to the ISS on the
Cygnus NG-12 spacecraft.
Double-sided tape (3 M, Cat. 9731) was placed on the backside
of the coupons to adhere them onto the inserts. Adhered coupons
on inserts were installed in the FPAs and autoclaved. FPAs were
loaded with 2.75 ml of sterile 1.18X LBK and the ﬁrst chamber was
closed with a second insert. The use of solid inserts prevents gas
exchange and forces anaerobic growth of P. aeruginosa. The ﬁrst
chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h as a contamination
check. Afterward, the second chamber was loaded with 0.5 ml of
the PA14 inoculum in stasis and closed with a rubber septum. The
third and last chamber was ﬁlled with 1.75 ml of PFA or RNAlater
and closed with a rubber septum. Eight FPAs with the three-
chamber conﬁguration were assembled into each GAP and
transferred to 4 °C.
Bioﬁlm formation assays
Spaceﬂight samples were launched in stasis (in PBS and at 4 °C) to
the ISS to avoid bacterial growth before microgravity conditions
were achieved. Once in microgravity, astronauts Jessica Meir and
Christina Koch activated the spaceﬂight samples by combining the
ﬁrst and second chambers of the FPAs, which introduced the
inoculum into the culture media. Samples were incubated at 37 °C
inside BioServe’s Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) for the
designated incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days) in anaerobic
conditions. At the end of incubation, the third chamber was
introduced to ﬁx (PFA) or preserve (RNAlater) the samples in
microgravity, and samples were transferred to 4 °C or −80 °C,
respectively, until unberthing. Fixed and preserved samples then
returned to Earth at 4 °C and −20 °C, respectively. Once on Earth,
samples were stored at 4 °C (ﬁxed) and −80 °C (preserved) until
sample processing.
Ground samples were performed asynchronously, activating
and terminating two hours later to replicate the order of ﬂight
procedures. The temperature proﬁle of spaceﬂight samples was
also reproduced for the ground samples. When spaceﬂight
samples returned to Earth, all coupons (both ﬂight and ground)
were recovered from the FPAs and processed for morphology
analysis (PFA) or transcriptomic analysis (RNAlater).
Planktonic cell analysis
Despite bioﬁlms being the focus of our experiment, the planktonic
cell culture of the samples was visually inspected with the naked
eye for notorious changes between samples. In addition, the liquid
cultures’ optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured. Samples
were vortexed prior to measuring the OD600 to avoid cell clumping.
Due to spaceﬂight constraints and the interest of ﬁxing the samples
while in microgravity, it was not possible to measure CFU/mL at
experiment’s end. However, for P. aeruginosa PA14 in our
experimental conﬁguration, the OD600 measurements allow correct
distinction of the bacterial stages of growth and are correlated to
the viable cell density (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4).
Bioﬁlm morphology analysis
To eliminate the planktonic cells, the coupons ﬁxed in PFA were
washed three times with 1 mL of PBS which was slowly poured on
the walls of the wells to avoid disturbing the bioﬁlm. The samples
were stained with PI [15 µM] (PromoKine Cat. PK-CA707-40017
diluted with water) for 15 min and with FilmTracer™FM™1-43
Green Bioﬁlm [10 µg/ml] (Invitrogen Cat. F10317 diluted with
DMSO and water as per manufacturer’s instructions) for 30 min
under light-protected conditions. After each stain the samples
were washed with 1 ml of PBS. Immediately after the wash, the
PBS was removed and the stained samples were mounted onto
glass slides; gorilla glue was used to adhere the coupon to the
slide and the bioﬁlm on top was covered with one drop of
VectaShield HardSet™Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Labora-
tories, Cat. H-1400-10) and a coverslip. Mounted samples were
stored at 4 °C for 20 h protected from light prior to imaging, this
allowed the mounting medium and glue to harden in order to

in groups of 4 per session (spaceﬂight samples with their
corresponding ground controls in the same session).
The

Confocal

(inverted) of CU Boulder Light Microcopy Core Facility was used
to take four 125 × 125 µm Z-stacks (30–40 slices with step size
ranging from 0.1–1.5 µm, average 0.5 µm) per coupon, aligning
the four ﬁelds of view to the center of the coupon. The bioﬁlms
were imaged with 100X SR Apo immersion oil objective (NA = 1.49
WD = 120 µm),
using
lasers
488 nm
(green,
emission
ﬁlter
500–550 nm) and 561 nm (red, emission ﬁlter 575–625 nm). All
images were acquired with 1.2 pinhole, laser power range (green
and red = 0.1 to 2.3), offset range (green = −48 to 4, and
red = −45 to 6), and PMT HV range (green = 3.0 to 86, red = 2.0
to 82) using the NIS Elements software. Images were taken with
laser powers that avoided photobleaching and HV sensitivity
settings that maximized the dynamic range without saturation.
Resulting bioﬁlm images were pseudo-colored with red (PI, nucleic
acids) and green (Green Bioﬁlm, lipids) for display with a linear
LUT covering the full range of the data. Raw image ﬁles were used
for quantitative analysis. First, Image J was used to merge both
ﬂuorescent channels and convert ﬁles from nd2 to tiff format.
Then, the “Slice Remover” plugin was used to eliminate the slices
with no bioﬁlm signal from each Z-stack. The “Convert to OME-
Tiff” macro was used to generate compatible ﬁles for analysis with

calculated bioﬁlm mass (µm3/µm2), thickness (µm), and surface

Bioﬁlm transcriptomic analyses
Samples preserved in RNAlater were thawed at room temperature
and washed 3 times with 1 ml PBS to get rid of any planktonic
cells. PBS was removed and 1 ml of fresh RNAlater was added. The
samples were ultrasonicated for 15 min at 40 kHz, followed by
5 min of vortexing to detach bioﬁlm bacterial cells from the
surface materials. RNA extraction was performed by University of
Colorado Boulder BioFrontiers Sequencing Core and the sequen-
cing by the Anschutz Genomics Shared Resource. The RNAlater
with the suspended bioﬁlm cells was centrifuged, and the pellet
was used to extract total RNA using the Quick-RNA Fungal/
Bacterial microprep Kit (Zymo Research Cat. R2010). RIN values
were measured for the RNA extracted (Supplementary Table 12)
RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded
Total RNA-Seq Kit v3 (Takara Cat. 634485) and paired-end
sequencing was performed on Illumina NOVASeq 6000 with 40
million reads per sample (Additional Transcriptomic information
presented in Supplementary Table 13).
Transcriptomic analysis was performed on CU Boulder’s RMACC
Summit supercomputing cluster. Raw sequencing ﬁles were
checked for quality control using FastQC (version 0.11.9)93 and
multiQC (version 1.0.dev0)94. Then Illumina adapter contamination
was eliminated using Trimgalore (version 0.6.6) with cutadapt
(version 2.6)95, after which quality control was performed again.
Trimmed reads were mapped to PA14 rRNA sequences to remove
the contamination, the resulting unmapped reads were then
mapped to the Ensembl Bacteria reference genome of Pseudo-
monas
aeruginosa
UCBPP-PA14
(accession
number
GCA_000014625), both mapping steps were performed using
Bowtie2 (version 2.4.4)96. The mapping results were sorted,
indexed, and converted from .sam ﬁles to .bam ﬁles using
SAMtools (version 1.11)97. The reads per gene were counted with
Feature Counts (Rsubread package version 2.8.2)98, and differential
gene expression analyses were done in an R (version 4.1.1)99 with
DESeq2 (version 1.34.0)100. Pathways enrichment analyses were
performed online using ESKAPE Act PLUS101 and the whole list of
DEG (including ≤2-fold change genes) per condition as input.
Statistics
Morphology data was tested for parametric assumption compliance
using Shapiro Wilk and Levene’s tests. The data did not comply with
all the assumptions, thus non-parametric tests were used for all
statistical analyses. Bioﬁlm biomass, thickness, and surface area
coverage data was compared between groups using two-sided
Kruskal Wallis and Dunn’s (with Bonferroni correction) tests to
determine if differences observed were signiﬁcant. Signiﬁcant
differences have the signiﬁcance level speciﬁed in parenthesis or in
the plot (minimum of p-value < 0.05), while the non-signiﬁcant values
correspond to p-value > 0.05. Differential gene expression analysis
was performed with DESeq2 using p-value < 0.05 as signiﬁcance
threshold, except for comparison between SS316 and pSS316 which
used p-adj ≤0.05. Pathways enrichment analysis was performed with
