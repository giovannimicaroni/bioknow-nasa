Eukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of
cellular volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms
are poorly understood. From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling
mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana, we cloned a mutant allele of a gene
that encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to
two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to FRIENDLY,
which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of
mitochondria in Arabidopsis. In contrast to FRIENDLY, these three
homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms.
Based on these data, we proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a
small gene family to help regulate the energy metabolism of cells
that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Indeed, we found
that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast phe-
notypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume
devoted to chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these
genes as REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC). The size of the
chloroplast compartment was reduced most in rec1 mutants. The
REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the nucleus. REC1 was
excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with amitrole,
which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude
that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size
of the chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell
expansion or chloroplasts may regulate REC1.

hloroplasts drive plant growth, development, and reproduc-
tion by converting solar energy into biologically useful forms
of energy. Thus, the biogenesis and function of chloroplasts un-
derpin crop yields and, indeed, life on Earth. Chloroplasts develop
from proplastids during germination and leaf development (1).
After chloroplast biogenesis, chloroplasts divide by binary fission.
A number of mutant alleles enhance or reduce the size of indi-
vidual chloroplasts by attenuating or promoting chloroplast di-
vision (2). Regardless of the size of individual chloroplasts, the
proportion of cellular volume devoted to all chloroplasts appears
indistinguishable from wild type in these mutants (3–5). Thus, the
mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment
appears distinct from the mechanisms of chloroplast division.
The cell expansion that drives the expansion of leaves also drives
the proliferation of chloroplasts. Indeed, the proliferation of chlo-
roplasts is so tightly correlated with cell expansion that the ratio of
the size of the chloroplast compartment to the size of mesophyll
cells is constant, regardless of cell size (2, 6, 7). Cell type exerts a
major influence over the proportion of cellular volume devoted to
the chloroplast. For instance, the size of the chloroplast compart-
ment in mesophyll cells is larger than in epidermal cells. Thus, an
extraplastidic mechanism appears to determine the size of the chlo-
roplast compartment (6). However, during the expansion of leaves,
chloroplasts are not completely submissive to the cell. Indeed,
chloroplast dysfunction inhibits the expansion of leaves (8).
Although mechanisms that establish the proportion of cellular
volume devoted to particular organelles are of fundamental im-
portance to biology, these mechanisms remain poorly understood
(2). In the particular case of chloroplasts, understanding these
mechanisms may lead to significant advances for agriculture. For
example, introducing C4 photosynthesis into rice, a plant that
performs C3 photosynthesis, is one strategy for potentially in-
creasing yields from this important crop (9). C3 and C4 leaves are
distinct at the metabolic, cellular, and anatomical levels (9, 10).
One of the conserved features of C4 leaves is the increase and
decrease in the size of the chloroplast compartment in bundle
sheath and mesophyll cells, respectively, relative to C3 leaves (10).
The engineering of C4 photosynthesis in important C3 crops, such
as rice, is thought to depend on the ability to rationally manip-
ulate the size of the chloroplast compartment (11).
We performed a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants
in Arabidopsis thaliana (12). From this screen, we obtained one
mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function.
Significance
Mechanisms that determine the cellular volume allocated to
organelles are largely unknown. We demonstrate that in the
plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a small gene family that encodes
proteins of unknown function contributes to a mechanism that
establishes the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chlo-
roplasts. We show that this mechanism resides outside of the
chloroplast by demonstrating that the protein that makes the
greatest contribution to this mechanism resides in the cytoplasm
and nucleus and that the trafficking of this protein between the
cytoplasm and nucleus may regulate this mechanism. A deeper
understanding of this mechanism may lead to the rational ma-
nipulation of chloroplast compartment size, which may lead to
more efficient photosynthesis and increased yields from im-
portant crop plants.

This gene is homologous to two Arabidopsis genes that encode
proteins of unknown function and to FRIENDLY. FRIENDLY and
its orthologs promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in
Arabidopsis and in nonphotosynthetic organisms (13). However,
these three Arabidopsis homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in
photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we thought that
FRIENDLY may have expanded into a small gene family to help
manage the energy metabolism of cells that contain both chloro-
plasts and mitochondria. We tested this idea by examining the
phenotypes of mutants in which one, two, three, or all four of these
genes are knocked out. We found that these mutants exhibited a
number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a smaller chloroplast
compartment relative to wild type. Thus, we named these genes
REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC). We also found
that the protein that contributes most to establishing the size of the
chloroplast compartment, REC1, localizes to both the nucleus and
the cytosol, and we provide evidence that signals derived from
dysfunctional chloroplasts or the inhibition of cell expansion may
regulate the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1.
Results
Cloning and Characterizing rec1-1. We obtained one mutant allele
of REC1 that we named rec1-1 from a screen for genomes uncoupled
(gun) mutants (12). gun alleles disrupt the plastid-to-nucleus sig-
naling that down-regulates photosynthesis-associated nuclear gene
(PhANG) expression when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked. Thus,
gun mutants express higher levels of PhANGs than wild type when
chloroplast biogenesis is blocked (8). In addition to a gun phenotype,
rec1-1 greens after seedlings are grown in far-red light and then
transferred to white light (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A).
When wild-type seedlings are grown in far-red light, they over-
accumulate the chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide. In
white light, these elevated levels of protochlorophyllide block
chloroplast biogenesis by inducing increases in the levels of
singlet oxygen (14, 15). We mapped this greening phenotype to a
70-kb interval near the top of chromosome 1 (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1B). We sequenced seven genes in this interval. We found a
C-to-T transition that causes a nonsense mutation in the codon
that encodes Q1415 of At1g01320 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C and
D). At1g01320 encodes a protein of unknown function with a
calculated mass of 200 kDa. This protein contains three tetra-
tricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and 106 residues near the carboxyl
terminus that are 29% proline (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). TPRs
contribute to the protein–protein interactions that underpin di-
verse biological processes (16).
We obtained three publicly available T-DNA insertion mutants
with insertions in At1g01320. We named these T-DNA insertion
alleles rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4. We found reduced levels of
mRNA transcribed from At1g01320 in all of these mutants
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2). We also analyzed these mutants by im-
munoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies raised against
fragments of the protein encoded by At1g01320 that spanned
from P1419 to F1673 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). When whole-leaf
extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting, these antibodies
recognized a single band in an extract that was prepared from
wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Based on the mobility of this
protein in a 5% SDS gel (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D), we estimated
that its mass is 240 kDa. This 240-kDa protein does not accu-
mulate to detectable levels in rec1-1, rec1-2, rec1-3, or rec1-4
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B and C).
We found that, similar to the rec1-1 allele, the three T-DNA
insertion alleles inhibited the far-red block of greening (Fig. 1A).
We found that the chlorophyll levels in rec1-1 were 71% of wild
type. In contrast, we found that the chlorophyll levels of rec1-2,
rec1-3, and rec1-4 were 57–58% of wild type (Fig. 1B) and 81–82%
of rec1-1 (P = 0.001–0.006). We conclude that rec1-1 attenuated
the accumulation of chlorophyll and that rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4
are null alleles. These data are consistent with rec1-1 expressing a
truncated protein that promotes the accumulation of chlorophyll.
We were not able to detect such a truncated protein because our
antibodies bind residues that are carboxyl-terminal to Q1415.
To test whether the three T-DNA insertion mutants are gun
mutants, we grew them on media that contained either norflurazon
or lincomycin. Norflurazon and lincomycin specifically block chlo-
roplast biogenesis by distinct mechanisms and severely down-reg-
ulate the expression of PhANGs, such as the genes encoding the
light harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins of photosystem II
(Lhcb) and the small subunit of RuBisCO (RbcS) (8). We found
that rec1-1 accumulated 3.2- to 4.3-fold more Lhcb1.2 than wild
type and that rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 accumulated significantly
more Lhcb1.2 mRNA than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
However, rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 accumulated significantly less
Lhcb1.2 mRNA than rec1-1 (P < 0.0001–0.009) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S4). We observed a similar trend with RbcS1A expression
(SI Appendix, Fig. S4). In contrast, gun1-101 (12), a null allele of
a relatively well studied GUN gene (8), induced 13- and 35-fold
increases in Lhcb1.2 expression when chloroplast biogenesis was
blocked with norflurazon and lincomycin treatments, respectively
(SI Appendix, Fig. S4). These data provide evidence that nor-
flurazon treatments activate a repressive plastid-to-nucleus sig-
naling mechanism that is not activated by lincomycin treatments
or that an inductive mechanism present in lincomycin-treated
seedlings is absent in norflurazon-treated seedlings.
In untreated seedlings, Lhcb1.2 mRNA accumulated to
significantly lower levels in rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 than in
wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), which is consistent with the
chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes of these mutants (Fig. 1B). The
levels of RbcS1A mRNA were not significantly different in the
untreated wild type and rec1 mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Based on these data, we conclude that these rec1 alleles specif-
ically disrupted the plastid-regulated expression of these PhANGs
and that At1g01320 is REC1.
Our characterization of these rec1 alleles indicates that rec1-1
behaves as a loss-of-function allele when the far-red block of
greening and the chlorophyll accumulation phenotypes are scored
and that rec1-1 enhances the levels of PhANG expression relative
to other mutant alleles of REC1 when the gun phenotype is scored.
A truncated REC1 protein that is partially active may underpin
these phenotypes. There is precedence for mutant alleles causing
both loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes (17, 18).

Characterization of the REC Gene Family Mutants. The REC1 pro-
tein is homologous to three other Arabidopsis proteins that are
encoded by At4g28080, At1g15290, and FRIENDLY (At3g52140)
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The proteins encoded by At4g28080 and
At1g15290 have no known function. Loss-of-function alleles of
FRIENDLY and its orthologs in Dictyostelium discoideum, Sac-
charomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster cause mito-
chondrial clustering (19). FRIENDLY and orthologous proteins
were reported to perform a variety of functions, such as binding
and regulating atypical protein kinase C (20), binding mRNAs
that encode mitochondrial proteins and promoting the biogenesis
of mitochondria (21), and promoting intermitochondrial associa-
tions before mitochondrial fusion (13). The calculated masses of
the proteins that are encoded by At4g28080, At1g15290, and
FRIENDLY are 200 kDa, 180 kDa, and 150 kDa, respectively. We
named At4g28080 and At1g15290 REC2 and REC3, respectively,
based on their derived amino acid sequence similarity to REC1.
REC1 is more similar to REC2 and REC3 than to FRIENDLY
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Homologs of REC1, REC2, REC3, and
FRIENDLY are present in other plant species (SI Appendix,
Fig. S6). In contrast, eukaryotes that do not perform photo-
synthesis contain only orthologs of FRIENDLY, usually as a
single-copy gene (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
To test whether REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY contribute to
the same or different processes as REC1, we obtained T-DNA
insertion alleles for each of these genes. We found that T-DNA
insertions reduced the levels of mRNA transcribed from these
genes (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). In REC3 mutants, the low levels of
mRNA are not expected to encode functional proteins because
the insertions are in exons. In REC2 and FRIENDLY mutants,
the reduced levels of mRNA might express truncated proteins that
are not functional. Indeed, three independent T-DNA insertions
into REC2 caused chlorophyll to accumulate at significantly lower
levels than in wild type, and these reduced levels of chlorophyll
were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.3–0.6)
(SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). We conclude that these three alleles
are nulls. Based on the robust mitochondrial clustering phenotype
of the T-DNA insertion allele of FRIENDLY (SI Appendix,
Fig. S7B), we conclude that this allele is either a null or a strong
loss-of-function allele.
To determine the full impact of these four genes on chloroplast-
related processes, we prepared double, triple, and quadruple
mutants with rec1-3, rec2, rec3-1, and friendly in all possible
combinations. We found that rec2, rec3-1, rec3-2, and friendly
exhibited a far-red block of greening that was more similar to
wild type than to rec1-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A). We found that
after 3 d of growth in far-red light, protochlorophyllide accu-
mulated to significantly lower levels in rec1-3 than in wild type,
protochlorophyllide accumulated to significantly higher levels in
friendly than in wild type, and protochlorophyllide levels were not
significantly different from wild type in rec2 and rec3-1 (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S8B). Significantly less protochlorophyllide accu-
mulated in double and triple mutants containing rec1-3 and the
quadruple mutants relative to the relevant single, double, and triple
mutants (P < 0.0001–0.005). Significantly more protochlorophyllide
accumulated in rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec2
friendly, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly than in rec3-1, rec1-3 rec3-1,
rec1-3 rec2, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, respectively (P = 0.0003–0.02).
We conclude that mutant alleles of REC1 inhibit the far-red block
of greening by reducing the levels of protochlorophyllide.
Attenuating phytochrome A signaling inhibits the far-red block
of greening (15). Perhaps the simplest way to test for defects in
phytochrome A signaling is to measure hypocotyl lengths in far-
red light. We found that, in the dark, the lengths of the rec1-3
hypocotyls were not significantly different from wild type but that
those of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly were 11% shorter (SI Appendix,
Fig. S8C). However, we found that in 3 μmol·m−2·s−1 far-red light,
the hypocotyls of rec1-3 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly were not
significantly different from wild type (P = 0.4–0.5) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S8D). We conclude that the inhibition of the far-red block
of greening in rec1 mutants is probably not caused by defects in
phytochrome A signaling.
We found that when chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with a
lincomycin treatment, Lhcb1.2 expression in rec2 and rec3-1 was
69% and 68% of the levels observed in wild type, respectively. In
friendly, RbcS1A expression was increased 1.5-fold but Lhcb1.2
expression was not significantly different from wild type
(SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). Double and triple mutants containing
rec1-3 and friendly tended to exhibit gun phenotypes, as did the
quadruple mutant, whereas the double and triple mutants con-
taining rec2 and rec3-1 generally did not exhibit gun phenotypes
(SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). The most robust gun phenotype was
observed for rec1-3 rec2 friendly, which accumulated 3.3- and 2.2-
fold more mRNA from Lhcb1.2 and RbcS1A, respectively, than
wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). Thus, this gene family makes
significant but minor contributions to the plastid regulation of
these PhANGs relative to GUN1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
REC gene family mutants appear chlorophyll-deficient (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S9). These chlorophyll deficiencies ranged from uni-
form chlorophyll deficiencies to virescence in rec1-3 rec3-1 and
rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). We quantified the
chlorophyll levels of these mutants and found that rec1-3 and
rec2 accumulated 63% and 81% of the chlorophyll found in
wild type, respectively (Fig. 2). In several instances, combi-
nations of these alleles enhanced the chlorophyll-deficient
phenotypes of rec1-3 and rec2. The most extreme examples
were rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1
friendly, which accumulated 31%, 21%, and 16% of the
chlorophyll found in wild type, respectively (Fig. 2). In con-
trast to rec1-3 and rec2, there was no significant difference in
the levels of chlorophyll that accumulated in rec3-1, friendly,
rec3-1 friendly, and wild type (P = 0.2–0.8) (Fig. 2). Addi-
tionally, rec3-1 and friendly did not affect the accumulation of
chlorophyll in rec1-3 friendly, rec2 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 (P =
0.1–0.9) (Fig. 2). However, rec1-3 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1
accumulated significantly less chlorophyll than rec1-3 and rec1-3
rec2 (P < 0.0001), respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, rec3-1 attenuated the
accumulation of chlorophyll in particular genetic contexts. Addi-
tionally, rec1-3 rec2 friendly accumulated significantly more chlo-
rophyll than rec1-3 rec2 (P = 0.0004) and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1
friendly accumulated significantly less chlorophyll than rec1-3

rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.002) (Fig. 2). Thus, the effect of friendly on the
accumulation of chlorophyll depended on the genetic context.
The chloroplast ultrastructure in many of the mutants resembled
wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). The chloroplast ultrastructures of
chlorophyll-deficient mutants typically resemble wild type (22, 23).
The most severely chlorophyll-deficient mutants (Fig. 2) tended to
have long and thin chloroplasts relative to wild type (SI Appendix,
Fig. S11). Similar phenotypes were not reported for tetrapyrrole
biosynthesis mutants, such as the severely chlorophyll-deficient
gun4 hy1 and gun5 hy1 double mutants (22). Holes were observed
in the chloroplasts of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 that were surrounded by
double membranes (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). These holes probably
resulted from the sectioning of cytosolic protrusions into the
chloroplasts that do not disrupt the chloroplast double mem-
brane. Consistent with this interpretation, a mitochondrion was
found in one of these holes (SI Appendix, Fig. S12).
The grana thylakoids of the mutants appeared similar to wild
type, but rec1 rec2 rec3-1 contained fewer grana thylakoids than
wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). A reduction in the number of
grana thylakoids is not commonly observed in Arabidopsis mu-
tants unless the chlorophyll deficiencies are severe (22–24). The
thylakoid membranes appeared swollen in four friendly mutants
(SI Appendix, Fig. S14) and similar to wild type in the other
friendly mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Swelling of the thylakoid
membranes was not reported previously for friendly mutants (13,
25). These data are consistent with complex interactions among
these alleles affecting the ability of the thylakoid membranes to
withstand osmotic pressure (26).
To further characterize the chloroplast defects of these mutants,
we imaged the chloroplasts in live cells from the abaxial epidermal
cells to the cortical region of the spongy mesophyll cells in leaves
using confocal laser scanning microscopy. We found a number of
differences relative to wild type. These differences included a
tendency of the chloroplasts to localize along the anticlinal walls
of mesophyll cells, enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence in both the
mesophyll and epidermal cells, and fewer chloroplasts in the
mesophyll cells in particular triple mutants and the quadruple
mutant (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S15). The chloroplasts of
the mesophyll cells residing along the anticlinal walls and the
increases in chlorophyll fluorescence are consistent with in-
creased sensitivity to light (27, 28). To test whether a potentially
enhanced sensitivity to light led to a rise in the levels of reactive
oxygen species, we stained leaves with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
and nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT) to detect hydrogen peroxide and
superoxide, respectively. These mutants appear to accumulate var-
iable levels of reactive oxygen species (SI Appendix, Fig. S16).
The chlorophyll biosynthesis mutants cch and gun4-1 (29, 30)
were analyzed to test whether chlorophyll deficiencies might cause
similar phenotypes. cch and gun4-1 were previously reported to
accumulate only 30–40% of the chlorophyll found in wild type
(30). Similar to the REC gene family mutants, the chloroplasts of
cch and gun4-1 appeared along the anticlinal walls in mesophyll
cells (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with the enhanced sensitivities
of chlorophyll-deficient mutants to light (31). cch exhibited en-
hanced chlorophyll fluorescence relative to gun4-1 and wild type
(SI Appendix, Fig. S15). Thus, chlorophyll deficiencies were not
correlated with increases in chlorophyll fluorescence.
The distribution of chloroplasts within the mesophyll cells in
many of these mutants appeared to differ from wild type (Fig. 3A).
To quantify these differences, we calculated a fractal dimension
(DF) and a lacunarity parameter (Λ) for each image (32). Calcu-
lating DF allowed us to compare the geometric complexity of the
distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant (32).
Calculating Λ allowed us to compare the heterogeneity (e.g., the
gaps) in the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each
mutant (32). Significant differences in the value of the DF were
observed in nine of these mutants (Fig. 3B). The values for DF
were not significantly different from wild type in rec1-3, rec1-3
rec3-1, and mutants containing both rec3-1 and friendly, namely
rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 friendly
(Fig. 3B). In contrast to other mutants containing both rec3-1 and
friendly, the DF of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly was significantly less
than wild type (Fig. 3B). This difference may reflect the decrease
in the number of the chloroplasts in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly
relative to other mutants that contain both rec3-1 and friendly
(Fig. 3A). Chlorophyll deficiencies do not explain the differences

in geometric complexities of these images because although the
DF values of the images from cch were significantly less than wild
type, the DF values of the images from gun4-1 were not signifi-
cantly different from wild type (Fig. 3B).
Λ was significantly reduced in all of the mutants except rec2 and
rec1-3 rec3-1 (Fig. 3C). Although Λ was significantly less in gun4-1
than in wild type, Λ was not significantly different between cch and
wild type (Fig. 3C). Based on these data, we conclude that sig-
nificant differences in the gaps of the chloroplast networks of the
rec and friendly mutants were not caused by chlorophyll defi-
ciencies. Our analysis of DF and Λ provides evidence that the rec
alleles, friendly, and combinations of the rec and friendly alleles
affect the distribution of chloroplasts. Differences in the numbers,
sizes, and shapes of these chloroplasts may account for some of
these differences in DF and Λ.
Mutants with abnormal distributions of chloroplasts often ex-
hibit abnormal chloroplast movements because of deficiencies in
the machinery that helps chloroplasts track along the cytoskeleton.
Abnormal chloroplast movements are readily detected with chlo-
roplast photorelocation experiments (27). We found that chloro-
plast photorelocation was indistinguishable between rec1-3 rec2
rec3-1 friendly and wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S17 and Movies S1
and S2). We also imaged stromules by targeting yellow fluorescent
protein (YFP) to the plastids because the number of stromules is
reduced when the association of stromules and the cytoskeleton is
disrupted (33). We observed no significant differences in the ap-
pearance or number of stromules in wild type, rec1-3, and rec1-3
rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.1–0.5) (SI Appendix, Fig. S18).
To quantify the reduced chloroplast compartment size pheno-
types that we observed in live cells from the cortical region of the
spongy mesophyll, we fixed leaf sections with glutaraldehyde and
quantified the plan areas of fixed mesophyll cells and their chlo-
roplasts (3). In the mutants, the size of the chloroplast compart-
ment in the glutaraldehyde-fixed cells appeared reduced relative to
wild type, especially in particular triple mutants and the qua-
druple mutant (Fig. 4A). The number of chloroplasts was cor-
related with the mesophyll cell plan area in each mutant and
wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S19). This correlation was pre-
viously demonstrated for wild type (2, 3, 7). We found that in
many of the mutants, the number of chloroplasts per cell plan
area was reduced relative to wild type. The greatest reductions in
the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area were 44–62%,
observed in rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 friendly, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1,
and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S19).
The reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area
exhibited by rec1-3 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly (24–25%)
were significantly greater than in the relevant single mutants (P <
0.0001–0.03) (Fig. 4B). Without rec1-3, combinations of rec2, rec3-
1, and friendly did not significantly decrease the number of
chloroplasts per cell plan area. In most instances, friendly did not
significantly affect the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area
(P = 0.0714–0.9198). However, a significant increase in the num-
ber of chloroplasts per cell plan area was observed in rec2 rec3-1
friendly relative to rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.0003). Based on these data,
we conclude that rec1-3 attenuates the number of chloroplasts per
cell plan area more than the other mutant alleles tested and that
friendly promotes the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area in
a specific genetic context.
The mutants with no or small (15–25%) reductions in the
number of chloroplasts per cell plan area also exhibited small (7–
14%) reductions in chloroplast plan area relative to wild type
(Fig. 4C). The largest reduction in chloroplast plan area was 22%
observed in rec2 rec3-1 friendly. However, rec2 rec3-1 friendly was
unusual relative to the other mutants tested in that it also ex-
hibited a 17% increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell
plan area relative to wild type (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the other
mutants, the three most chlorophyll-deficient REC gene family

friendly; Fig. 2) exhibited 31–46% increases in their chloroplast
plan areas relative to wild type (Fig. 4C). The increases in
chloroplast plan area observed in rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1,
and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly are small compared with the 500%
to ∼2,000% enlargements in chloroplast plan area that were
reported for chloroplast division mutants (2, 5, 34). These find-
ings are consistent with the idea that rec and friendly alleles
disrupt mechanisms that regulate chloroplast division rather than
those that perform chloroplast division. Numerous signals ap-
pear to regulate chloroplast division (2).
Consistent with the observed large reductions in the number of
chloroplasts per cell plan area and either no increases or small
increases in chloroplast plan area, we found that chloroplast
coverage (total chloroplast plan area per cell plan area) was sig-
nificantly reduced in many of the mutants compared with wild type
(Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Fig. S20). Moreover, we observed a
significant interaction between the presence of rec1-3 and the
number of mutant alleles (P < 0.00001). In the presence of rec1-3,
chloroplast coverage fell as the number of mutant alleles increased
(Fig. 4D). The greatest reduction in chloroplast coverage (50%)
was observed in the quadruple mutant (Fig. 4D).
In contrast, when plants contained REC1, adding further mu-
tant alleles did not significantly reduce chloroplast coverage, re-
gardless of the number of mutant alleles present (Fig. 4D).
Normalizing chlorophyll levels (Fig. 2) to chloroplast coverage
(Fig. 4D) indicates that the chloroplasts of friendly accumulated
significantly more chlorophyll than wild type (SI Appendix,
Fig. S21). This analysis also indicates that the reduced chloro-
plast coverage phenotypes explain the chlorophyll-deficient phe-
notypes in rec2, rec2 rec3-1, rec2 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 friendly
and the differences between the severely chlorophyll-deficient
mutants rec1-3 rec2 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 and between rec1-3 rec2
rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (SI Appendix, Fig. S21).
However, normalizing chlorophyll levels to chloroplast coverage
does not explain the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes of rec1-3,
the double and triple mutants that contain rec1-3, or the qua-
druple mutant (SI Appendix, Fig. S21). Thus, rec1-3 attenuates
both chloroplast coverage and the accumulation of chlorophyll.
To test whether chlorophyll deficiencies might contribute to
these chloroplast coverage phenotypes, we analyzed glutaral-
dehyde-fixed mesophyll cells from rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly,
gun4-1, and cch grown in 35 μmol·m−2·s−1 white light rather than
the 125 μmol·m−2·s−1 white light that was used for the previous
experiments. Reducing the irradiance increases chlorophyll levels in
chlorophyll-deficient mutants (31). When grown in 125 μmol·m−2·s−1
white light, the individual chloroplasts of cch were difficult to dis-
tinguish by differential interference contrast microscopy. We also
analyzed the glutaraldehyde-fixed mesophyll cells from four mu-
tants grown in 125 μmol·m−2·s−1 white light: the plastid-to-nucleus
signaling mutant gun1-101 (12) and the chlorophyll-deficient and
photomorphogenic mutants constitutive photomorphogenic 1-4
(cop1-4), de-etiolated 1-1 (det1-1), and phytochrome A phytochrome
B double mutant (phyA phyB) (35).
We found that rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly accumulated more than
twofold higher levels of chlorophyll in 35 μmol·m−2·s−1 white light
relative to 125 μmol·m−2·s−1 white light (SI Appendix, Fig. S22 C
and D) and that rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, gun4-1, cch, cop1-4,
det1-1, and phyA phyB were chlorophyll-deficient relative to wild
type (SI Appendix, Figs. S22 C and D, S23 A, D, and E, S24, and
S25 C and D). The average number of chloroplasts per cell plan
area decreased and the average chloroplast plan area increased in
rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and wild type in 35 μmol·m−2·s−1 white
light relative to 125 μmol·m−2·s−1 white light (SI Appendix, Fig. S22
A, E, and F). We observed a variety of significant differences in the
number of chloroplasts per cell plan area and chloroplast plan area
phenotypes of gun4-1, cch, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB relative
to wild type (SI Appendix, Figs. S23 B, D, F, and G and S25 A, B, E,
and F). The more than twofold increase in chlorophyll levels did
not affect chloroplast coverage in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (SI
Appendix, Fig. S22 B and G). Chloroplast coverage was not sig-
nificantly different from wild type in gun4-1, cch, cop1-4, det1-1, or
phyA phyB (P = 0.7–1.0) (SI Appendix, Figs. S23 C, D, and H and
S25 B and G). The number of chloroplasts per cell plan area,
chloroplast plan area, and chloroplast coverage phenotypes of
gun1-101 were not significantly different from wild type (P = 0.6–
0.8) (SI Appendix, Fig. S26).
We conclude that both the number of chloroplasts per cell plan
area and chloroplast plan area are probably controlled by a number
of mechanisms that regulate chloroplast division, and that these
signals include light signaling and signals induced by chlorophyll
deficiencies. Chlorophyll deficiencies do not completely explain
these phenotypes because, although the chloroplast plan areas were
larger than wild type in cop1-4, det1-1, phyA phyB, rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3
rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, the chloroplast plan areas
were smaller than wild type in cch and gun4-1. Additionally, we
conclude that, in general, altering light-regulated development and
significantly attenuating the accumulation of chlorophyll do not
affect chloroplast coverage in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells. We also
conclude that chlorophyll deficiencies do not explain the reduced
chloroplast coverage phenotypes of the rec mutants.
We found that two components of the chloroplast division
machinery—filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ)1-1 and
FtsZ2-1—accumulated to lower levels in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly
than in wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S27). Reducing the levels of
FtsZ1-1 and FtsZ2-1 inhibits chloroplast division but does not af-
fect chloroplast coverage (36). Any number of signals may down-
regulate the expression of FtsZ1-1 and Fts2-1 in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1
friendly. The reduced expression of FtsZ1-1 and Fts2-1 may par-
tially explain the enlarged chloroplasts of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly.
To test whether the levels of the REC1 protein limit the size of
the chloroplast compartment, we used the 35S promoter from
cauliflower mosaic virus to drive the overexpression of REC1 in
sgs3 rdr6-11—a double mutant that is resistant to transgene-
induced gene silencing (37). We found three independent trans-
genic lines that accumulated more REC1 protein than sgs3 rdr6-11
(SI Appendix, Fig. S28). Chloroplast coverage increased from 11%
to 17% in the transgenic lines that accumulated elevated levels of
REC1 (Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Fig. S29). In lines 40 and 66, the
increase in chloroplast coverage appeared to result mostly from an
increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area without a
significant change in the plan areas of individual chloroplasts (Fig.
5B). However, plots of total chloroplast plan area and chloroplast
number versus cell plan area provide evidence for heterogeneity in
the organellar basis for the increase in chloroplast coverage for
line 40 (SI Appendix, Fig. S29), possibly resulting from the atten-
uation of chloroplast division in some of the larger cells from line
40. In line 44, the increase in chloroplast coverage appeared to
result from an increase in the plan areas of individual chloroplasts
and no change in the number of chloroplasts per cell (Fig. 5C and
SI Appendix, Fig. S29), possibly resulting from the misregulation of
chloroplast division in this particular transgenic plant.
Subcellular Distribution of REC1. To gain insight into the mechanism
that underpins the biological functions of REC1, we determined
the subcellular distribution of REC1 by fusing YFP to the carboxyl
terminus of REC1, transiently expressing the REC1-YFP fusion
protein in tobacco leaves and monitoring the subcellular distribu-
tion of REC1-YFP by confocal laser scanning microscopy. To test
whether REC1-YFP was transiently expressed as a full-length
protein, we analyzed leaf sections expressing REC1-YFP by im-
munoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies. The immunoblotting
analysis indicates that REC1-YFP accumulates as a single band (SI
Appendix, Fig. S30A) and that the mass of REC1-YFP is greater
than the mass of native REC1 (SI Appendix, Figs. S3D and S30B).
Live-cell confocal microscopy analyses with settings that dis-
tinguish GFP, YFP, and chlorophylls (38) show REC1-YFP in the

nucleus and the cytosol (Fig. 6A). The nucleus is recognizable by
the appearance of the nucleolus (Fig. 6A, arrow) and by the lo-
calization of ssGFP-HDEL, an endoplasmic reticulum marker
that defines the nuclear envelope (39) (Fig. 6B). We found that
REC1-YFP is excluded from chloroplasts (Fig. 6 C and D).
To test whether the functional state of the chloroplast might af-
fect the subcellular distribution of REC1, we infiltrated one leaf of a
tobacco plant with amitrole, an herbicide that causes chlorophyll
deficiencies (40). We found that amitrole caused observable chlo-
rophyll deficiencies in leaves that developed from shoot apical
meristems after infiltrations (Fig. 6I). We suggest that amitrole
moved from the sites of infiltrations to the shoot apical meristem,
where it attenuated the chloroplast biogenesis that occurred during
leaf development. In these chlorophyll-deficient leaves, chloroplasts
were significantly smaller than in untreated leaves (Fig. 6 C and G).
In these chlorophyll-deficient leaves, REC1-YFP localized to the
cytosol and was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 6 E–H).
We tested whether REC1 was enriched in nuclear and cytosolic
fractions prepared from Arabidopsis seedlings. The enrichment of
histone H3 and UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase in the nuclear
and cytosolic fractions, respectively, indicates that nuclei and cy-
tosols were enriched in these preparations (Fig. 7A). Using affinity-
purified anti-REC1 antibodies (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), we found
that REC1 was enriched in these nuclear and cytosolic fractions
(Fig. 7A). Although these anti-REC1 antibodies recognized mul-
tiple bands in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, they recognized
only one band in the whole-seedling extracts prepared using de-
naturing conditions (Fig. 7A and SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). We
conclude that the affinity-purified anti-REC1 antibodies recognize
multiple bands in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, because
partial proteolysis of REC1 occurred during the purification of the
nuclear and cytosolic fractions. Next, we tested whether herbicides
affect the levels of REC1 in purified nuclei. We found that REC1
was present at similar levels in nuclei regardless of whether nuclei
were purified from untreated seedlings or seedlings that lacked
functional chloroplasts because chloroplast biogenesis was blocked
with a norflurazon treatment (Fig. 7 A and B and SI Appendix,
Fig. S31A). When chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with an
amitrole treatment, much longer exposures of immunoblots than
used to detect REC1 in the nuclear fractions from norflurazon-
treated and untreated seedlings provided evidence that only trace
quantities of REC1 accumulated in nuclei purified from amitrole-
treated seedlings (Fig. 7B and SI Appendix, Fig. S31A). Methyl
viologen induces a rise in the levels of chloroplastic reactive oxygen
species that causes chloroplast dysfunction and activates the
plastid-to-nucleus signaling that induces the expression of nuclear
genes, such as the nuclear genes that encode cytosolic ascorbate
peroxidase (41). To test whether chloroplastic reactive oxygen
species affect the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1, we
transferred 5-d-old seedlings to a growth medium that contained 1
μM methyl viologen and allowed the seedlings to grow for an
additional 3 d. Higher levels of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase and
lower levels of chlorophyll accumulated in the methyl viologen-
treated seedlings than in untreated seedlings (SI Appendix, Fig.
S31 B–D). We conclude that this methyl viologen treatment in-
duced chloroplast dysfunction and the expression of cytosolic
ascorbate peroxidase, probably by inducing a rise in the levels of
chloroplastic reactive oxygen species. We found that REC1 ac-
cumulated to similar levels in the nuclei of methyl viologen-
treated and untreated seedlings (Fig. 7C). In addition to inhibiting
chloroplast function, amitrole inhibits root elongation (40), which
depends on cell division and cell elongation (42). To test whether
inhibiting cell expansion might drive REC1 out of the nucleus, we
tested whether REC1 accumulates in the nuclei of the Arabidopsis
null mutant rhd3-7 (43). rhd3-7 and other RHD3 mutants are
smaller than wild type because cell expansion is inhibited in these
mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S31A) (43, 44). We found that REC1
accumulated to similar levels in the nuclei of rhd3-7 and wild type
(Fig. 7D). We conclude that amitrole treatments specifically ex-
clude REC1 from the nucleus.

the proteins encoded by the REC gene family, there are no can-
didates for proteins that contribute to this mechanism (2, 6, 45).
Cells of the shoot apical meristem contain fewer than 10
proplastids. After chloroplast biogenesis and during the meso-
phyll cell expansion that occurs during leaf development, there is
a large increase in the number of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells
(45). The mesophyll cells from rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly con-
tained 22 ± 8 chloroplasts (SI Appendix, Figs. S19 and S22A).
Thus, the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast
compartment is partially active in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. A
few models are consistent with these data. One possibility is that
the proteins encoded by the REC gene family directly contribute
to the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast
compartment and that this mechanism retains partial activity in
rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. Another possibility is that the proteins
encoded by the REC gene family regulate a mechanism that
establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment. A third
possibility is that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family
contribute to a mechanism that helps to establish the size of the
chloroplast compartment, and a distinct mechanism that does
not require the REC genes independently contributes to the size
of the chloroplast compartment.
Further study of the REC genes may lead to the ability to ra-
tionally manipulate the size of the chloroplast compartment and to
the engineering of C4 photosynthesis into C3 plants, which is an-
ticipated to increase yields from important crops, such as rice (9,
11). The contribution of the REC genes to the distribution of
chloroplasts in mesophyll cells may also contribute to the engi-
neering of C4 photosynthesis into C3 plants, because the distribu-
tion of chloroplasts within mesophyll cells differs between C3 and
C4 plants (11). The rec and friendly mutants appear deficient in a
mechanism that is distinct from the mechanisms that are deficient
in other chloroplast distribution mutants because in contrast to the
normal photorelocation observed in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, the
photorelocation of chloroplasts is abnormal in other chloroplast
distribution mutants (27).
In contrast to the rec2, rec3, and friendly alleles that we tested,
rec1-3 reduces the accumulation of chlorophyll. This observation
raised the possibility that the chlorophyll deficiencies of the rec1
mutants might prevent chloroplasts from keeping pace with a
mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compart-
ment. Indeed, in crumpled leaf (crl) and clumped chloroplasts 1
(clmp1), chloroplasts do not keep pace with this mechanism be-
cause chloroplasts are not equally distributed between daughter
cells during cell division (46, 47). Our finding that inducing an in-
crease in the levels of chlorophyll does not affect chloroplast cov-
erage in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and that chloroplast coverage is
not significantly different from wild type in the chlorophyll-deficient
mutants cch, gun4-1, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicates that
chlorophyll deficiencies do not prevent chloroplasts from keeping
pace with the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast
compartment. Chlorophyll deficiency is a common phenotype in
Arabidopsis. Thus, disrupting any number of chloroplast functions
may indirectly affect the thylakoid membranes. Indeed, disrupting
mechanisms that drive chloroplast division and mechanisms that
potentially regulate chloroplast division appears to indirectly affect
the normal development of the thylakoid membranes (34, 48, 49)
and the accumulation of chlorophyll (47, 50, 51).
The screening of 3,500 ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) mutants
for plants with aberrant morphologies in the chloroplast com-
partment, such as abnormal chloroplast coverage (3), was not
sufficient to saturate this screen (52). Nonetheless, screening
∼2,000 EMS-mutagenized Arabidopsis plants is usually sufficient
for isolating specific mutants (53). Indeed, the screen of Pyke
and Leech (3) yielded more than 10 different genes that, in most
instances, encode proteins that directly contribute to chloroplast
division (2). An additional screen of 10,000 EMS mutants for
plants with enlarged chloroplasts yielded only one additional
gene that directly contributes to chloroplast division (54). Ad-
ditionally, a screen of 5,200 Arabidopsis mutants that were ho-
mozygous for T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes that mostly
encode chloroplast proteins for mutants with aberrant morphol-
ogies in the chloroplast compartment, such as abnormal chloro-
plast coverage, yielded one chloroplast division mutant and no
chloroplast coverage mutants (46). These data and our finding that
chloroplast coverage is not different from wild type in cch, gun4-1,
gun1-101, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicate that a reduction
in the size of the chloroplast compartment is not a common phe-
notype. We suggest that the REC genes may directly contribute to a
mechanism that links increases in the size of the chloroplast
compartment to increases in the size of mesophyll cells because
reduced chloroplast coverage is not a common phenotype and
because overexpressing REC1 induces significant increases in
chloroplast coverage. Our finding that the REC1 protein resides in
the cytosol and nucleus further supports the idea that REC1 helps
to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment because this
mechanism is expected to reside in an extraplastidic compartment.
A less than twofold increase in chloroplast coverage was ob-
served in the fully expanded leaves and mature green fruits of the
high pigment 1 (hp-1) mutant of tomato (55). HP-1 encodes UV-
damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) (56). DDB1 interacts
with DET1, a master repressor of light-regulated development that
contributes to ubiquitin-proteasome–mediated protein degrada-
tion (35). Our analysis of cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicates

that defects in light-regulated development do not necessarily af-
fect the size of the chloroplast compartment in mesophyll cells.
The biochemical functions of REC1, REC2, and REC3 are not
known. FRIENDLY appears to perform a variety of functions (13,
20, 21). The indistinguishable photorelocation of chloroplasts that
we observed in wild type and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and the
localization of REC1 to both the cytosol and the nucleus conflict
with the idea that REC proteins directly contribute to the tracking
of chloroplasts along the cytoskeleton. Similarly, mitochondrial
clustering in friendly does not result from a cytoskeletal or motor
defect (13). The enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence, chloroplasts
aligning along the anticlinal walls, abnormal chloroplast ultrastruc-
ture, and chlorophyll deficiencies in the rec and friendly mutants
indicate that these mutant alleles induce chloroplast dysfunction.
REC1, REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY may contribute to pro-
cesses in the cytosol and nucleus that promote the function of
chloroplasts and mitochondria. Consistent with this interpreta-
tion, FRIENDLY was localized to the cytosol, and mutations in
FRIENDLY and the Drosophila ortholog of FRIENDLY induce
metabolic dysfunction (13, 57).
The finding that REC1 is excluded from the nucleus when
chloroplast biogenesis is blocked or attenuated with an amitrole
treatment is consistent with a plastid signaling mechanism that is
activated by amitrole treatments regulating the subcellular dis-
tribution of REC1. This inference follows because proteins
larger than ∼40 kDa are actively transported across the nuclear
envelope (58) and because the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of
proteins contributes to a number of processes, including diverse
signaling mechanisms (35, 58). The finding that, in contrast to
amitrole treatments, norflurazon and methyl viologen treatments
do not exclude REC1 from the nucleus is consistent with a plastid
signaling mechanism that is activated by amitrole treatments but
not activated by norflurazon and methyl viologen treatments
regulating the subcellular distribution of REC1. Consistent with
this interpretation, plastid-to-nucleus signaling mechanisms appear
numerous (8).
Another possibility is that an extraplastidic mechanism that is
inhibited by amitrole treatments might affect the subcellular dis-
tribution of REC1 because in contrast to norflurazon and methyl
viologen (8, 59), amitrole is not a specific inhibitor of chloroplast
function. Although amitrole inhibits plastidic processes, such as
carotenoid biosynthesis and histidine biosynthesis, amitrole is
more effective at inhibiting root elongation, which depends on cell
division and cell elongation (40). Our findings that the REC genes
link increases in cell size to increases in chloroplast compartment
size and that amitrole specifically affects the nucleocytoplasmic
partitioning of REC1 are consistent with the inhibition of cell
expansion regulating the subcellular distribution of REC1. If the
inhibition of cell expansion excludes REC1 from the nucleus,
rhd3-7 may not affect the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1
because rhd3-7 does not sufficiently inhibit cell expansion.
Amitrole treatments may inhibit a process in the nucleus by
excluding REC1 from the nucleus. Alternatively, amitrole-treated
plants may attempt to stimulate a cytosolic process by driving
REC1 into the cytosol. Another possibility is that REC1 per-
forms the same function or different functions in the nucleus
and the cytosol.
In summary, we provide evidence that REC1, REC2, REC3,
and FRIENDLY promote the proper morphology, function, and
size of the chloroplast compartment. These functions may de-
pend on the trafficking of REC1 between the nucleus and the
cytosol. Signals activated by the inhibition of cell expansion
or chloroplast dysfunction may regulate this mechanism. Under-
standing the biochemical function of REC1 and the nucleocyto-
plasmic partitioning of REC1 may lead to the rational manipulation
of the size of the chloroplast compartment and higher yields from
important crops.
Materials and Methods
Detailed information on the materials and methods used in this study is
provided in SI Appendix.
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions. All mutants used in this study were
derived from A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0). Plants were grown
on soil or on Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) growth medium in either broad-
spectrum white light or far-red light in controlled-environment chambers.
The far-red block of greening experiments were adapted from Barnes
et al. (15).
Analysis of Chlorophylls. Chlorophylls were extracted using N,N′-dime-
thylformamide and quantified by spectrophotometry.
Analysis of Chloroplasts by Microscopy. Chloroplasts were imaged by confocal
laser scanning microscopy. Chlorophyll fluorescence, DF, and Λ were calcu-
lated from maximum-intensity projection images built from Z-stack images.
The chloroplast number per cell plan area, chloroplast plan area, and chlo-
roplast coverage were quantified as described previously (3).
Construction, Expression, and Imaging of the REC1-YFP Fusion Gene. The ORF
that encodes YFP was fused in-frame and downstream of an ORF that encodes
the full-length REC1. Transient expression of REC1-YFP in Nicotiana tabacum
was performed by infiltrating amitrole-treated or untreated leaves with an
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain harboring the REC1-YFP fusion gene. The
imaging of YFP fluorescence was performed using confocal laser scanning
confocal microscopes.
Analysis of Whole-Seedling Extracts, Nuclear Fractions, and Cytosolic Fractions.
Seedlings were grown on LS medium containing no sucrose or on the
same medium containing 1% sucrose and an herbicide. Whole-seedling
extracts were prepared by boiling frozen and powdered seedlings in
SDS/PAGE sample buffer and then clarifying these extracts by centrifu-
gation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Nuclei were purified from seedlings using
Percoll step gradients. Cytosolic fractions were the supernatants that were
obtained by lysing purified protoplasts and then clarifying these lysates
by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 15 min. Equal amounts of protein were
analyzed by immunoblotting.
