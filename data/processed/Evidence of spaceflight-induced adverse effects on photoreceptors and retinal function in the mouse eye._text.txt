Abstract: The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure
and retinal function after exposure to spaceﬂight, and to evaluate the efﬁcacy of an antioxidant in
reducing spaceﬂight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were
ﬂown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a
weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and
during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical
environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a
handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals
were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet
monochromatic light ﬂashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated
before euthanasia. There were signiﬁcant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-
ﬂight compared to pre-ﬂight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among ﬂight
groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre-
and post-ﬂight groups with no signiﬁcant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls.
Immunoﬂuorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death
after spaceﬂight. BuOE treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker.
ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were signiﬁcantly decreased (39%
and 32% by spaceﬂight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls. These data indicate
that spaceﬂight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell
damage and retinal function impairment.

1. Introduction
Neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been identiﬁed in astronauts. These complex
physiological and pathological changes are collectively deﬁned as spaceﬂight-associated
neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1]. The condition can lead to long-term effects, including
changes in visual acuity, even after the astronauts have returned to Earth. The underlying
mechanisms of the changes and functional outcomes of observed ocular change remain
poorly understood.
An increase in oxidative stress in the retina and photoreceptors is thought to be a
key factor in the development of retinal disease [2]. Overproduction of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) leads to damage of the critical cell populations and tissue remodeling.
Previous studies have revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for the oxidative biomarker,
4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), in the retina, following space radiation exposure [3] and
spaceﬂight [4].
Because environmental, radiotherapy, and pathological conditions can induce the pro-
duction of a high level of unstable oxygen species, efforts have been made to develop drugs

with therapeutic potential. However, practical application has been somewhat disappoint-
ing due to complications such as short half-lives, low reaction rate constants, lack of cellular
uptake, and hypersensitivity reactions [5]. Metal-containing catalytic antioxidants have
emerged as especially promising. Of these, redox-active metalloporphyrins possess distinct
antioxidant properties, including scavenging O2−, H2O2, and lipid peroxides that mediate
cellular and tissue damage [6]. These compounds have proven efﬁcacious in numerous
in vivo animal models of disease in reducing oxidative stress [7–10]. Furthermore, in pre-
vious studies, we documented the protective effects of a redox-active metalloporphyrin
(MnTE-2-PyP) to both photoreceptors and retinal capillaries from radiation damage [11,12].
Butoxyethylpyridylporphyrin–MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, (BuOE), is a superoxide dismu-
tase (SOD) mimic, that is also termed BMX-001, and is currently in multiple phase 1 and
phase 2 human clinical trials. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ has shown protective effects against
radiation-induced damage to the brain white matter and hippocampal neurogenesis [13,14].
Our previous ﬂight data showed a signiﬁcant increase in apoptotic damage in the
photoreceptors of ﬂight mice compared to ground controls [4]. However, the pathophys-
iological consequences of cellular damage on photoreceptor and retinal function have
not been well investigated. In the present study, mice were ﬂown on SpX-24 aboard the
International Space Station (ISS) for 35 days to characterize the space environment-induced
oxidative damage on ocular structure and retinal function using histochemistry, intraoc-
ular pressure (IOP), and electroretinography (ERG). The antioxidant effects of BuOE in
mitigating spaceﬂight condition-induced retinal damage were evaluated.
2. Results
2.1. Body Weight
Mice were weighed before launch and shortly before being euthanized after landing.
Prior to taking off, the body weights were similar among all groups. The ﬂight (FLT)
and habitat ground control (GC) groups weighed between 25 and 27 g. The body mass
after landing, for both the saline control and BuOE-treated FLT mice, was not signiﬁcantly
different compared to that of pre-ﬂight measurements. However, body weights for the age-
matched GC groups were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) increased following the ﬂight compared
to pre-ﬂight measurements (Figure 1).

measurements (p < 0.05).
2.2. IOP Measurement
IOP was measured from a randomly selected left or right eye of each mouse before
launch and shortly after landing. The post-ﬂight saline and BuOE-treated FLT groups
showed a decreasing trend in IOP, compared to pre-ﬂight measurements, but there were
no statistical differences with 11.4 and 10.2 mmHg for pre- vs. post-ﬂight saline group,

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7362

and 11.3 and 10.3 mmHg for pre- vs. post-ﬂight BuOE-treated groups, respectively. The
measurements for the ﬂight groups were similar to that of the GC groups (Figure 2).

left or right eyes of pre- and post-ﬂight IOP for ﬂight (FLT) and ground control (GC) mice (n = 8). Six
readings were made to obtain an average count as a single IOP readout. Values are the means ± SEM.
2.3. ERG Assessment of Retinal Function
To assess the mouse retinal function, we measured the amplitude of the ERG a-
wave, which is generated by the activation of photoreceptors, a measure of photoreceptor
function, and b-wave, which is primarily generated by the ON-type bipolar cell neurons [15].
Representative ERG waveforms for FLT saline vs. GC saline and FLT saline vs. FLT BuOE-
treated groups were compared in Figure 3a,b. The ﬁgures illustrate average a- and b-wave
amplitude measurements in response to the strongest ﬂash, with stimulus energies of log
2.5 cd·s/m2 over implicit time. The amplitudes for a- and b-waves for the ﬂight groups
were reduced when compared to controls. The waveforms were similar between post-ﬂight
saline and BuOE-treated groups. The longitudinal changes of amplitude and implicit time
(time-to-peak) for a- and b-waves with increased ﬂash intensities for pre- and post-ﬂight FLT
and GC groups were presented in Figures 4 and 5. Differences in amplitude and implicit
time to light stimulation were noted in the FLT group following the spaceﬂight when they
were compared to pre-ﬂight measurements or the GC group. Reduced amplitudes and
delayed peak time observed in the FLT group may indicate low sensitivity of cone cells in
response to stimulus ﬂash.
When compared to pre-ﬂight, the amplitude of the a- and b-wave that reﬂected an
average response to all ﬂash intensities in the post-ﬂight group was signiﬁcantly reduced
(p < 0.05) for both saline and BuOE-treated groups (Figure 6a,c), while the amplitude of a-
and b-waves for pre- and post-ﬂight in the GC group was similar (Figure 6b,d).
When the a-waves of post-ﬂight groups were compared, there were statistical differ-
ences (p < 0.05) in average amplitudes between FLT and GC (Figure 7), while no differences
were noted among the groups when measured pre-ﬂight. The amplitude of the a-wave in
the BuOE-treated group was close to the GC controls. Our ERG data also showed that the
average amplitude of the b-wave that elicited a light-invoked slow cornea-positive poten-
tial was signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) decreased by 39% and 25% in FLT saline or BuOE-treated
mice compared to their habitat ground control counterparts, respectively (Figure 8). No
differences for b-waves were found among any of the pre-ﬂight groups.

2.4. Apoptosis in the Retina
Apoptosis in the retina and retinal endothelial cells (ECs) was evaluated using termi-
nal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end label (TUNEL) staining. Apoptotic cells
labeled with green ﬂuorescence (Figure 9a) were mostly detected in the retinal ganglion
cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL). Quantitative assessment revealed that the

density of apoptotic cells in the retina of the ﬂight saline group was 67% higher than GC
controls, with a strong trend difference (p = 0.056) (Figure 9b). The counts for apoptosis
were similar between the BuOE-treated and saline ﬂight groups. The data demonstrate that
spaceﬂight conditions induce retinal apoptosis. The retinal ECs showed a similar level of
apoptosis across all groups (Figure 9c).

2.5. Oxidative Damage in the Photoreceptor
The 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) marker for oxidative damage was evaluated in the
retina. Enhanced 4-HNE staining was seen in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL in
the spaceﬂight group compared to all other groups (Figure 10a). As shown in Figure 10b,
the ﬂuorescent intensity of 4-HNE in the photoreceptor cones of the ﬂight group mice was
signiﬁcantly increased (p < 0.05) compared to both the ground controls and the BuOE-
treated ﬂight group. The immunoactivity of HNE immunoreactivity in BuOE-treated FLT
retina was similar to saline or BuOE-treated GC groups.
Cone photoreceptors were stained with a specific immunofluorescent marker of
peanut agglutinin (PNA). Quantitative evaluation (Figure 10c) revealed a decrease of
20% in the cone photoreceptor density in the spaceflight saline mice, with an average of
812 counts/mm2 compared to the GC group which had an average of 1007 counts/mm2
(p = 0.067). There were no significant differences in the cone density between the flight
saline and BuOE groups.

3. Discussion
Observed changes following spaceﬂight include increased oxidative damage and
increased apoptosis in the mouse retinal nuclear layer and photoreceptors. ERG data, for
the ﬁrst time, demonstrated that spaceﬂight evoked changes in photoreceptor function
in a mouse model. The average amplitudes of a- and b-waves for the ﬂight group were
signiﬁcantly reduced when compared to controls.
Our results show that FLT mice did not gain weight after the ﬂight as was observed
for the age-matched GC group. Other spaceﬂight studies reported a loss in body mass
after spaceﬂight [16,17]. It has been proposed that the lack of increase in body mass
may be related to mixed factors, including dehydration, stress, altered glucose, and lipid
metabolism, or less food consumption [18,19].
Elevated IOP is a major risk factor for the development and progression of many
ocular diseases, especially glaucoma [20]. IOP and intracranial pressure (ICP) changes
are suspected to be involved in the ocular anatomical changes and visual function im-
pairment exhibited by some astronauts [21]. Results from head–down bed-rest studies,
which simulate the microgravity effects, have shown IOP and ocular blood ﬂow changes.
These changes are implicated in the pathophysiology of optic disk edema [22]. For our
study, within 20 h of splashdown, we measured the IOP of ﬂight and control groups in
fully conscious mice. The data were consistent with previous observations and showed no
signiﬁcant differences between pre- and post-ﬂight groups, or between ﬂight and control
groups. This indicates that a 35-day space mission may have a limited impact on irre-
versible IOP changes pathologically. One possible explanation is that IOP is a transient
and time-sensitive parameter. Changes can happen within seconds to minutes. Due to
logistical limitations, we were unable to measure IOP until 20 h after splashdown, and
elevations in this readout may not have been detectable. Studies have shown that IOP
ﬂuctuates considerably with time, body postural change, venous pressure changes, and
stress levels [23]. Further evaluation of IOP during spaceﬂight or longer time sustained
microgravity conditions will be required.
The ERG is an electrical potential generated in response to light stimulation of the
retina and recorded from the corneal surface of the eye. ERG technology is a powerful
approach in assessing retina function [24] and ganglion cell activity [25]. The mouse retina
expresses a short wavelength-sensitive and a middle/long wavelength-sensitive opsin (S-
and M-opsin) [26], whereby the S-cones are responsive to ultraviolet (UV) peak at 360 nm,
and M-cones and rods are responsive to the green light at peak 504 nm. Previous studies
suggested that the mouse cone system predominantly expresses S-opsin [27]. Since S-opsin
sensitivity drops signiﬁcantly at wavelengths longer than 425 nm, only UV light is efﬁcient
in stimulating mouse S-opsin [27]. In our present study, we focused on probing S-cone-
mediated properties using UV light stimulation. Despite the small percentage of cones
in the mouse photoreceptor (5%) [28], cone-mediated responses in mouse ganglion cells
are fast and sensitive. Our measurement enables us to quantify cone-mediated response
and correlate this with histochemistry evaluation. Cone bipolar pathways are similar to
those found in mammals [29]. Therefore, the mouse is potentially a useful model to study
cone-mediated vision and for diseases that affects the cone function in humans [27,29].
The two ERG components that are most often measured are the a- and b-waves. The
a-wave is the ﬁrst large negative component that reﬂects the physiological status of pho-
toreceptor rods and cones, followed by the b-wave, which is a cornea-positive amplitude.
The b-wave reﬂects the health of the inner layers of the retina, including the ON bipolar cell
and Müller cell depolarization in response to increases in light stimulation [15]. Reduced
a- and b-wave amplitudes documented in the ﬂight group indicate retinal photoreceptor
damage and disturbance of retinal physiological function. These changes are associated
with the observed increase in apoptosis in the inner nuclear ganglion cell layer, and a
decrease in cone density following spaceﬂight. Abnormal ERG is recognized in many
ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and cone
dystrophy [15,30,31]. Most human retina disorders are detected by attenuation of ampli-

tude [25]. Studies have also shown a correlation between a decrease in cone-driven function
through reductions of dark-adapted ERG b-wave amplitudes and cone photoreceptor loss
in a light damage model [32]. Our ERG and histological ﬁndings, for the ﬁrst time, show
that spaceﬂight-induced retinal functional change may occur as a result of photoreceptor
damage and cellular death. It is important to characterize and monitor retinal changes that
may lead to the progression of retinal disease and retinal degeneration.
Retinal neurons include amacrine, ganglion cells, and photoreceptors. Radiation-
induced photoreceptor loss has been shown in a previous study with 1 Gy of iron-56
irradiation [33]. Studies from the Space Shuttle Mission (STS-135) and Rodent Study-9
(RR-9) also showed a signiﬁcant increase in apoptotic cell damage in the outer nuclear
layer (ONL) and INL of the ﬂight mice photoreceptors [34,35]. Retinal nuclear cell damage
causes irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases [36]. Retinas are more sensitive to en-
vironmental damage than other central nervous system (CNS) neurons [37]. Apoptotic cell
death is documented in many forms of retinal vascular dysfunction and degeneration [38].
These ﬁndings suggest that retinal nuclear and photoreceptor cells play an important role in
maintaining the normal structure and function of the retina. Our data revealed signiﬁcant
increases in retinal nuclear/photoreceptor cell death and a trend showing a decrease in
cone density by spaceﬂight. The presence of apoptotic positive cells in this study supports
the hypothesis that apoptotic mechanisms are involved in retinal cell death. Further studies
will be required to determine whether these effects are reversible or continue to deteriorate
over time.
Oxidative stress-induced ocular tissue damage has been associated with a variety of
pathological conditions [2,39,40]. Oxidative stress is one of the leading causes of retinal
damage and retinal degenerative diseases [41]. Radiation-induced oxidative stress can dam-
age critical cellular structure and biomolecules [42], resulting in inﬂammatory responses,
cell death, and tissue remodeling [43,44]. We have shown in our previous studies that
spaceﬂight and space radiation exposures cause oxidative changes in the retina and retinal
vasculature [34,45,46]. HNE is a secondary product of lipid peroxidation during oxidative
stress [47]. This ﬂight study documented increased oxidative damage with 4-HNE staining,
a biomarker for lipid peroxidation in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL [4]. The
correlation between increased oxidative damage in photoreceptors and abnormal ERG
recording indicates that spaceﬂight impacts the retinal structure, physiology and function.
In future studies, we will determine if these observed changes will persist or reverse with a
longer re-adaption period.
The safety of BuOE has been evaluated in a battery of nonclinical Good Laboratory
Practice (GLP)-compliant studies. Systemic toxicity has been evaluated using the intended
cGMP product administered subcutaneously for periods of up to 5 weeks in both mouse
and the monkey, and have included toxicokinetic evaluations to characterize systemic
exposure, tissue distribution, and clearance of BuOE [48]. Redox-active metalloporphyrin
antioxidants have been shown to be effective in protecting against radiation-induced ocular
damage [11]. In the present study, with the current injection dose, our results showed that
BuOE is safe. Body weights among saline- or BuOE-treated ground control groups were
similar and no overt sign of toxicity related to this compound was observed.
Immunoreactivity of the oxidative stress biomarker, HNE, was signiﬁcantly reduced
in the BuOE-treated ﬂight group compared to the ﬂight saline group. This suggests
that BuOE was effective in reducing reactive oxygen species that activate retinal stress
responses during space ﬂight [49,50]. Metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidants are potent
detoxiﬁers of lipid peroxides and lipoperoxyl radicals, a process that is mediated via
hydroxyl radicals [6,51]. Our present study suggests that oxidative stress is a contributing
mechanism for observed damage in the retina and photoreceptor, which was demonstrated
by increased 4-HNE staining, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation. Adding BuOE, a lipophilic
metalloporphyrin compound with high potency for the catalysis of lipid peroxidation
reduced immunoreactivity of the biomarker in the BuOE-treated ocular tissue compared to

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7362
12 of 17
the ﬂight saline group, suggesting a potential mechanism of oxidative stress in inducing
cellular damage.
However, BuOE was found to only slightly mitigate spaceﬂight-induced apoptosis
in retinal photoreceptor or endothelial cells, suggesting that apoptosis was not inhibited.
Administration of BuOE had limited effects in attenuating spaceﬂight-induced retinal
functional change assessed by ERG recording, although it was more effective in restoring a-
wavet responses than b-wave responses, especially at high ﬂash intensity (Figure 3b). It may
be that the beneﬁcial or protective effects of BuOE with the current dosage was not sufﬁcient
to signiﬁcantly ameliorate the harmful spaceﬂight-induced effects on the retina or that
alternative stressors may be directly leading to apoptosis despite reduced oxidative stress.
Due to logistic limitations, the compound was injected once a week in orbit. More frequent
injections may be required to protect retinal function more effectively. Daily [52,53] or twice-
weekly [54] administration schedules have been reported to have signiﬁcant protective
effects from oxidative damage in other disease models. Free radicals produced in the
ocular tissues by the mechanism other than ROS, which include reactive nitrogen species,
and reactive carbonyl species [55], may be equally important in inducing cellular damage
in the retina. Another plausible explanation is that spaceﬂight conditions induced an
imbalanced oxidative/antioxidative homeostasis and antioxidant defense enhanced by this
redox-active compound may lead to apoptotic pathway regulation and recovery of retinal
function at a later time. We plan to evaluate oxidative stress biomarkers, apoptotic status,
and retinal function parameters at three months following live animal return to Earth, to
further assess the ocular tissue re-adaptation process. It is anticipated that a redox-active
metalloporphyrin can be effective in protecting against spaceﬂight-induced retinal damage.
4. Material and Methods
4.1. Spaceﬂight and Mouse Groups
Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched in December 2021, at the Kennedy
Space Center (KSC) on the rodent research-18 (RR-18) mission for 35 days aboard the ISS.
All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 ◦C with a 12 h light/dark
cycle during the ﬂight. This hardware has a housing density that is within the guidelines
recommended by the National Institutes of Health. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-
upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. The
ﬂight mice were subdivided into two groups: a saline control or BuOE-treated group.
BuOE at 1 mg/kg (0.2 mL) was administrated subcutaneously 7 days prior to the ﬂight
launch and weekly aboard the ISS. After returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule,
it took approximately 20 h for the mice to be recovered in the Atlantic Ocean, brought to
shore, and transported to the research laboratory at Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, Florida.
Upon live return, a subset of mice (8 per group) went through IOP and ERG testing.
The rest of the spaceﬂight mice (5 per group) were then euthanized with intraperitoneal
(IP) injections of Ketamine/Xylazine (up to 150 mg/kg Ketamine combined with up to
45 mg/kg Xylazine). Their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. The left eyes were
ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours, and then
rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes were dissected to
obtain the retina. The retinas were ﬂash-frozen and stored at −80 ◦C for further analysis.
Ground control mice were placed into the same housing hardware with environmental
parameters used in ﬂight. GC mice were euthanized three days later. Animal experiments
were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) on 14 October 2021 (Protocol Number: RR-18), Roskamp
Institute IACUC on 7 October 2021 (Protocol Number RR-18), and Loma Linda University
Health IACUC on 8 February 2022 (Protocol Number: 8170051). The activities involving
vertebrate animals were conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

4.2. IOP Measurement
IOP in conscious animals was measured pre-launch and post-ﬂight before eutha-
nization with a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC, USA). The animals
exhibited no signs of discomfort during the procedure. Five to six sequential measurements
were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse [56].
4.3. ERG
To measure photoreceptor function, ERG was recorded using a Micron® Ganzfeld
ERG system (Phoenix-Micron, Inc., Bend, OR, USA), according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Mice were dark-adapted for at least 3 h prior to obtaining ERG recordings which
were performed on the right eyes. Mice were maintained under anesthesia with 1.5–2%
Isoﬂurane through a nose cone and placed on a heated stage during testing to prevent
hypothermia throughout the procedure. The pupils were dilated with 1–2 drops of 0.5%
tropicamide (Akorn, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride
(Paragon BioTeck, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) ophthalmic solutions. Hypromellose (Go-
nak™) ophthalmic demulcent solution (2.5%) (Akorn, Inc.) was topically administered to
the eyes for proper contact with the corneal electrode. The Ganzfeld optical head includes
three LEDs with 360, 504, and 850 nm wavelengths. It illuminates the eye with near-infrared
at 850 nm during alignment of the corneal electrode guided by the Eye-Cockpit ( IDS uEye
software version 4.3, IDS Imaging Development Systems Inc., Minato City, Tokyo) cam-
era software. Three electrodes were attached to record the transretinal electrical signals:
the Ganzfeld corneal (positive) electrode was made of a gold conducting ring around
the objective lens, contact-attached to the cornea, sealing the eye. A reference (negative)
electrode was inserted subcutaneously through the head skin positioned midline between
the ears, such that the end of the needle was between the eyes. Finally, a ground electrode
was inserted subcutaneously through the base of the tail. ERG was recorded according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following signal baseline stabilization, ERG signals were
recorded in response to increasing intensities of 360 nm Ultraviolet monochromatic light
ﬂashes (1 ms duration). Ganzfeld uses a Maxwellian view of illumination, which projects
single light to the eye pupil illuminating the retina with high divergence. For each mouse,
ﬁve sweeps of electrical responses were acquired at each intensity ﬂash, with varying
stimulus intervals (Table 1). The waveform amplitudes (microvolts) and implicit times
(seconds) of a- and b-waves at each ﬂash stimulus were acquired from ﬁve averaged sweeps
and analyzed using the Labscribe software (LabScribeERG version 3.016800, iWorx sys-
tems, Dover, NH, USA). The amplitude of the a-wave represents the photoreceptor layer
hyperpolarization (negative) signal and the b-wave represents the inner retinal bipolar cell
and Müller cell depolarization (positive) response signal. Data obtained from all mice were
averaged to represent the mean ± standard error (SEM) of a-wave and b-wave amplitudes.

4.4. TUNEL Assay
Six µm sections were cut through each left eye for analysis. Five ocular sections,
roughly 100 µm apart, were evaluated using the TUNEL assay to identify and quantify
apoptotic cells, according to standard procedures. Brieﬂy, parafﬁn-embedded sections
were processed using DeadEnd™Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (catalog no. G3250,
Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The same sections were then incubated with Dy-
Light 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (1:100, catalog no. DL-1177, Vector laboratories
Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue).
4.5. IHC Staining
Six µm paraffin-embedded section of the left eye from 5 mice per group, roughly
100 µm apart, were used for analysis. To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina,
immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using 4-HNE antibody specific for
lipid peroxidation. For double labeling of HNE and PNA, sections were incubated
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated peanut agglutinin (catalog no. FL-
1071, Vector laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) (1:100 in 1% BSA) for an hour at
room temperature, for labeling the photoreceptor cones. Sections were then incubated
overnight (18–21 h) at 4 ◦C with rabbit primary anti-4-HNE antibody (1:1000, catalog
no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc. San Antonio, TX, USA). After washing
three times in PBS, sections were further treated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor
568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog no. A11011, Life Technologies Corp., Eugene, OR,
USA). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and were mounted and cover-
slipped with Vectashield Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (catalog no. H-1700,
Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA).
4.6. Quantiﬁcation of Immunostaining
Six to 10 ﬁeld images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted ﬂuorescence
microscope with structural illumination at 20X magniﬁcation, spanning the entire retina per
section. For quantitative analysis, the total numbers of TUNEL-positive nuclear /ganglion
cells or endothelial cells in the retina were counted. For cone density, numbers of PNA-
positive cells were counted within the entire nuclear layer of the ﬁeld image. The surface of
each section was measured on digital microphotographs using the ImageJ v1.4 software.
The mean of the density proﬁle measurements across 5 retinal sections that were 100 µm
apart per eye was used as a single experimental value. The density proﬁles were expressed
as the mean number of apoptotic cells or cone cells/mm2 for 5 samples of each group.
To quantify HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on
6–10 randomly selected fields and calculated using the Image J software. The data
were extracted and averaged within the group.
4.7. Statistical Analysis
We tested the normality of data distribution for IOP, ERG, 4-HNE, PNA, and TUNEL
assays using the Shapiro–Wilk test. The data were then analyzed by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly signiﬁcant difference) test for multiple
pair-wise comparisons. The means and standard error of means (SEM) are reported. α-level
was set at 0.05 for statistical signiﬁcance.
