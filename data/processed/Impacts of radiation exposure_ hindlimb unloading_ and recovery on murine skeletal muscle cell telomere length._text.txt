Astronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and microgravity. Spaceﬂight elongates human telomeres
in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postﬂight recovery. Astronauts also
encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceﬂights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of
astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and
muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceﬂight mimicking model. We ﬁnd telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem
cells and in myoﬁber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model
following hindlimb unloading recovery. We ﬁnd that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role
for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.

INTRODUCTION
In the vacuum of space, astronauts are continuously bombarded
by high energy cosmic radiation and must perform missions in
microgravity1. A better understanding of the consequences of
these two factors on body function and physiology are crucial for
the planning of safe and successful long-duration future missions.
A major detriment experienced by astronauts in ﬂight is muscle
atrophy, where a 1 month spaceﬂight can reduce muscle mass by
20%
and
muscle
strength
by
30%2.
Even
with
currently
implemented spaceﬂight countermeasures, involving rigorous
exercise, the deleterious physiological effects of spaceﬂight in
muscle atrophy and weakness induction are not completely
abrogated3–5. In addition to microgravity, astronaut exposure to
cosmic radiation can have effects on body systems that are still
being elucidated. It is well established that the skeletal muscle
atrophy due to exposure to both microgravity and radiation is
problematic because of its rapid onset and severity6.
Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also called satellite cells, are
necessary for muscle formation in embryogenesis and for muscle
growth during childhood and adolescence7,8. In healthy adults,
MuSCs from undamaged muscles remain quiescent. Following
injury, such as that arising from strenuous exercise, MuSCs
become activated, proliferate, and differentiate in a series of
coordinated steps, to properly repair muscle damage9. In the
context of muscle atrophy, MuSC properties are less clear. Atrophy
caused by cancer cachexia is known to activate speciﬁc signaling
pathways in skeletal muscles related to inﬂammation, protein
synthesis, and autophagy10. In satellite cells, atrophy-induced
signaling exerts effects on MuSC proliferative potential and
differentiation capacities11,12. In terms of effects of radiation
exposure to MuSCs, limited data are available. Exposure of
cultured human muscle progenitor cells to ionizing radiation has
negative effects on proliferative capacity and alters inﬂammatory
signaling13.
Studies
using
chronic,
lower
dose,
whole-body
irradiation of mice resulted in reduced MuSC numbers, reduced
proliferative capacity, and increased quiescence, but it had little
effect on differentiative capacity14. Higher dose leg-speciﬁc
radiation exposures have demonstrated similar results on reduced
proliferative capacities of juvenile mice; however, myoﬁber sizes
and MuSC differentiation effects were present as well15, suggest-
ing that level and duration of exposure could have different
effects on MuSCs, depending on these factors.
The length of telomeres is an important parameter of tissue
proliferative potential16. Telomeres are repetitive sequences
located at the ends of chromosomes, which can function as
cellular proliferation clocks17. Telomere attrition leads to loss of
cellular functionality and can lead to stem cell exhaustion in
diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy18,19. Shortened
telomeres are also correlated with atrophy of many organ
compartments, including brain20, spleen, small intestine, and
reproductive system, among others21. Additionally, it has been
reported that telomeres in cultured mouse and human ﬁbroblasts
appear more susceptible than other regions of the genome to
DNA damage, and they exhibit a persistent DNA damage response
following X-ray irradiation22. Increased DNA damage found at
telomeres has been associated with telomere attrition and/or
uncapping and cellular senescence, leading to loss of proper
cellular functionality23,24.
Recently, the effects of spaceﬂight have been meticulously
investigated in the NASA Twins Study, where effects of preﬂight,
inﬂight, and postﬂight conditions on a monozygotic twin were
measured by multiple metrics and compared with the grounded
twin brother25. That study revealed telomere lengthening in T cells
of the inﬂight astronaut, which rapidly shortened postﬂight25.
Another study investigating different astronaut ﬂight conditions
found similar results26. However, despite the importance of
maintaining skeletal muscles during spaceﬂight, telomere length
metrics in astronaut muscles have not been assessed.
The goal of this study was to measure telomere length in
resident skeletal muscle cells of grounded, wild-type mice
experiencing spaceﬂight-like conditions, using a whole-body

irradiation (IR) and hindlimb suspension (HLS)/mechanical unload-
ing approach. We found that a combination of IR and HLS resulted
in telomere elongation, speciﬁcally in myogenic cell populations,
which did not recover upon a short duration reloading of
hindlimbs.
RESULTS
Effects of HLS and IR exposure on skeletal muscle properties
To address the effects of muscle atrophy and/or irradiation (IR) on
skeletal muscles, we utilized the widely accepted hindlimb
suspension (HLS) ground-based model27, in combination with or
in the absence of whole-body ionizing radiation exposure. In our
experimental design, mice were divided into four different
cohorts: control (without IR exposure, without hindlimb suspen-
sion (HLS)), HLS only (no IR), IR only (no HLS), and combined
(HLS + IR); (Fig. 1). More speciﬁcally, wildtype mice were pre-
exposed to 2 Gy whole-body irradiation or sham irradiated and
further divided into groups experiencing HLS or not. Following a
3-week time course, mice were sacriﬁced, and various tissue
weight metrics were obtained. We found that at the study
endpoint, mouse whole-body weights were similar for all groups
(Fig. 2a), demonstrating that HLS did not detrimentally affect
mouse appetite. This ﬁnding is especially important, since
hindlimb unloading has been used as method to study behavioral
despair and depression, and appetite changes, if any, could have
inﬂuenced our study results28.
We next determined the effects of our experimental design on
internal organs. We found IR exposure alone had no effects on
kidney or spleen weights, but it did cause signiﬁcant (p < 0.0001)
reductions in testes weights, when compared to sham/control
mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). These ﬁndings are in agreement
with previous studies in mice and humans exposed to IR29,30. HLS
also had deleterious effects on testes gross size and normalized
weight (Supplementary Fig. 1a, d; p < 0.0001), consistent with a
previous report31. Additionally, kidney weights in HLS and
HLS + IR groups were slightly increased compared with controls
(Supplementary Fig. 1a, c; p = 0.0452, 0.0705, respectively), a
ﬁnding that was similarly reported in a rat HLS model32. No
differences
were
found
in
spleen
and
kidney
weights
in
combinatorial HLS + IR versus respective controls; however, the
testes HLS + IR group displayed additive detrimental effects on
testicular weight, relative to individual groups, consistent with
prior literature on organ size changes from HLS and/or IR
exposures29–31.
To assess the effects of these experimental conditions on skeletal
muscles, muscles were dissected post-trial and the level of atrophy
was queried (Fig. 2b). We found little difference in tibialis anterior
weights from mice that underwent HLS, and quadriceps weights
were variable, compared to respective controls (Figs. 2b–d). However,
gastrocnemius muscles did exhibit a signiﬁcant muscle atrophy in
HLS and HLS + IR groups (Fig. 2b, 2e; p = 0.0490, p = 0.0138,
respectively), leading us to focus on this muscle for the duration of
the study. To conﬁrm that gastrocnemius weight reductions affected
muscle ﬁbers, muscles were cryosectioned and stained with
ﬂuorescently-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which labels
extracellular matrix regions33. We observed signiﬁcantly smaller ﬁber
sizes in both HLS and HLS + IR groups, relative to control and IR
groups (Fig. 2f, g; p < 0.0001, p = 0.0399, respectively), further
validating the muscle atrophy effect. In aggregate, these data
unequivocally demonstrate a positive correlation between HLS and
gastrocnemius muscle atrophy that agrees with the muscle wasting
seen in previous HLS models27 and which mimics that described in
astronauts during spaceﬂights34.
Telomere length dynamics in spaceﬂight mimicked muscles
In the Twins Study, Garrett-Bakelman et al. demonstrated a
signiﬁcant lengthening of telomeres in circulating blood cells
(T cells) in the astronaut twin while in space25. However, telomere
lengths in muscle cells were not measured. Using a HLS + IR
spaceﬂight-mimicking system, we wished to query the effects of
telomere length on several skeletal muscle-resident cell types.
First, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH staining of telomeres on
gastrocnemius cryosections35. With this method, relative telomere
length was determined by intensity measurements of a ﬂuores-
cently labeled telomeric peptide nucleic acid probe, normalized to
the ﬂuorescence intensity staining of the entire nucleus by DAPI
staining. Cells of interest were identiﬁed by additional immunos-
taining to mark desired cells and/or the cellular positions within
the muscle. We ﬁrst queried telomere length in MuSCs, deﬁned as
VCAM+ cells that appear in the satellite cell position (Fig. 3a).
Quantiﬁcation of telomere length revealed no changes between
control, HLS, or IR MuSCs (Fig. 3b). However, when HLS + IR MuSC
telomeres were assessed, we found signiﬁcant telomere lengthen-
ing, as compared to all other groups (Fig. 3b, p < 0.0001). To
evaluate the cellular consequences of these alterations, we
evaluated MuSC populations and properties. We ﬁrst assessed
whether there were changes in MuSC numbers in atrophied
muscles, as had been suggested previously12. Gastrocnemius
cryosections were stained with the MuSC marker, Pax78, and total
number of positively stained cells per unit area was queried. We
found no changes in MuSC numbers between control vs IR, and
control vs HLS + IR treated groups, while a signiﬁcant increase in
MuSC numbers was observed in the control vs HLS only group
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b; p < 0.0001). While these ﬁndings are
interesting and unexpected, they did not correlate with the
observed changes in telomere length of the HLS + IR group. To
exclude other cellular defects associated with telomere length17,36,
we also investigated whether MuSCs were undergoing senescence
in response to our experimental manipulations. To interrogate the
level of senescence in skeletal muscles in our study, gastro-
cnemius cryosections were stained for senescence-associated
β-galactosidase
activity.
We
found
no
correlation
between
positively stained regions and cells within the satellite cell position
(Supplementary Fig. 3). These ﬁndings make senescence unlikely
as an inﬂuencing factor of telomere length modulation in HLS + IR
MuSCs.
It is known that skeletal muscle mass change during unloading
is associated with altered myonuclei37. Therefore, we next
evaluated whether telomere lengthening in HLS + IR gastrocne-
mius muscles was speciﬁc to only MuSCs or whether additional
myogenic nuclei also exhibited this phenomenon. To this end,
myonuclei, which were deﬁned as localizing within muscle ﬁbers
and staining negative for the stem cell marker VCAM38, were

examined for telomere length changes. Similar to what was found
for MuSCs, myonuclei also displayed increased telomere length in
HLS + IR gastrocnemius muscles, when compared with control,
HLS, or IR gastrocnemius myoﬁber myonuclei (Fig. 3c; p < 0.0001).
These data demonstrate that combinational HLS + IR of rodents
on the ground affects gastrocnemius myogenic cell telomere
length.
Since mechanical forces, including changes in gravity, have
been shown to affect endothelial cells39, we subsequently
assessed whether telomere length increases in HLS + IR mice
were

cells

the CD31+ (also known as PECAM-1) marker, previously shown to
accurately label endothelial cells40. We observed telomere length
dynamics to be quite variable between experimental groups in
endothelial cells (Fig. 4a, b), demonstrating that effects of HLS + IR
were most pronounced and reproducible in cells deriving from a
myogenic lineage.
Altogether, these results demonstrated that telomere length is
increasing synergistically in response to low gravity and irradiation

only in muscle cells (MuSCs and myonuclei) but not in endothelial
cells within skeletal muscles.
Effects of muscle reloading on muscle telomere length
In the NASA Twins Study, it was shown that while spaceﬂight
caused telomere lengthening in some peripheral blood cell
populations, return to earth caused rapid telomere shortening
within 48 hours, and a return to near baseline levels within
months25. Since our data demonstrated telomere lengthening in
HLS + IR MuSCs, we next sought to determine whether telomere
length in these cells also shortened following a recovery period,
where mice were returned to conventional mobility. To assess this
possibility, HLS + IR mice were allowed to recover for 2 weeks,
with unrestricted movement and normal muscle loading. For this
arm of the study, control, HLS + IR, and recovery groups were
compared (Fig. 5a). First, we assessed normalized organ weights
and found no signiﬁcant changes to normalized spleen weights
(Supplementary Fig. 4a) and kidney weights (Supplementary Fig.
4b) between the groups. Interestingly, testes weights also trended
higher in recovered animals, but they remained signiﬁcantly
smaller when compared to control weights (Supplementary Fig.
4c; p < 0.0001). Together, these data conﬁrm that the recovery did
not interfere with general organ mass. In assessing the effects of
recovery on skeletal muscles, we observed that gastrocnemius
muscles of recovered mice were larger than HLS + IR mice and
were of similar size to controls (Fig. 5b; p = 0.9927), demonstrating
that 2 weeks post-unloading is sufﬁcient to regain normal skeletal
muscle size. To evaluate telomere length alterations in the
recovered
muscles,
we
performed
CRYO
MuQ-FISH
in
the
gastrocnemius-derived
MuSC
populations
and
myonuclei
between the experimental groups. Surprisingly, we did not
observe telomere shortening in the recovery MuSCs, but instead
they retained elongated telomere length and continued to
increase even further, relative to the HLS + IR group (Fig. 5c;
p = 0.0186). Similarly, telomere length in myonuclei also remained
elongated following recovery (Fig. 5d), which also trended higher
but was not signiﬁcantly different compared with the HLS + IR
group (p = 0.4288). To further delineate whether there were
differential telomere length changes in muscle cell populations,
which may have been buried by the averaging of telomere length
analysis, we plotted this dataset as a distribution on a per cell basis
(Supplementary Fig. 5). These data show, that unlike what was
reported for T cells in the Twins Study, where a proportion of the
return to Earth cells exhibited population of critically shortened
telomeres25, we found few MuSCs with very short telomeres and

many more MuSCs with long telomeres. The telomere length
distribution of muscle cells is somewhat different from the
distributions reported in a follow-up study of blood cells in
populations of short and long telomeres26,41, suggesting that
different cell types might have different mechanisms of managing
telomere
length
under
spaceﬂight
or
spaceﬂight-mimicking
conditions. In aggregate, these data demonstrate that hindlimb
reloading for the indicated recovery period was not sufﬁcient to
shorten telomere length to control levels.
Telomere lengthening mechanisms in radiation-exposed
unloaded muscles
The most common mechanism of telomere elongation is through
the action of the enzyme telomerase42. To query the role of
telomerase in the observed telomere lengthening of HLS + IR
gastrocnemius muscle cells, we ﬁrst assayed for its expression.
Tert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, was undetectable in
skeletal muscles from control, HLS + IR, or recovery groups by
qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Similarly, expression of TERT was
absent at the protein level, by immunohistochemistry of cryosec-
tions (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Because telomerase expression in
muscles may be transient and/or only expressed in a small
population of cells, we interrogated telomerase activity by a
telomerase repeated ampliﬁcation protocol (TRAP) assay. We
found low telomerase activity in experimental gastrocnemius
muscles (Fig. 6a), with no signiﬁcant changes between control
muscles
and
HLS + IR
(p = 0.3684),
control
and
recovery
(p = 0.9720),
or
between
HLS + IR
and
recovery
groups
(p = 0.2812; Fig. 6b). Our ﬁndings are in agreement with a prior
study that showed telomerase activity is lost in differentiated
skeletal muscle cells43, and further suggest that telomerase might
not have a substantial role in telomere elongation in this system.
Since the observed telomere lengthening in muscles could not
be explained by telomerase activity, we sought to identify other
mechanisms by which telomere lengthening could be attributed.
Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a recombination-
based telomere maintenance mechanism utilized by 10–15% of
human cancers44. It has been previously reported that the DNA
damage responding proteins, ATRX and DAXX, must be down-
regulated for ALT to occur45–48. To this end, we quantiﬁed the
expression of these genes in control, HLS + IR, and recovery
muscles. Interestingly, we observed signiﬁcant downregulation of
both Atrx and Daxx transcripts in HLS + IR muscles, relative control
(p = 0.0005, p = 0.0009, respectively; Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that
ALT-related pathways are engaged in this model. When recovery
groups were examined, both Atrx and Daxx were still down-
regulated, although they did trend higher in both cases, relative to
HLS + IR groups (p = 0.5410, p = 0.4166, respectively; Fig. 6c, d).
Taken together, these data raise the possibility of ALT-related

DISCUSSION
Astronauts experience adverse health effects on long-duration
missions, including headaches, dizziness, congestion, changes in
blood cells, and fatigue, as well as severe bone and muscle loss49.
A better understanding of the causes of such impediments to
explorer health in an earthbound model could serve beneﬁcial
effects in the development of additional countermeasures or
prophylactic treatments meant to reduce physical health burdens.
Recently, a comprehensive NASA study, also commonly referred to
as the Twins Study, investigated and compared a multitude of
metrics, including physical changes, of an earthbound mono-
zygotic twin astronaut, to his brother, experiencing spaceﬂight25.
One reported aspect of this study was an observed effect of
telomere lengthening in peripheral blood T cells during space-
ﬂight, which was absent in the grounded twin25. Outside of space,
telomere length changes have been reported in degenerative
diseases, which often coincide with tissue atrophy50, including
skeletal muscle18,19,51,52. However, telomere length alterations in
skeletal muscle cells, both from mice18 and humans53,54, are not
correlated with the effects of aging, where sarcopenia, a muscle
wasting process, is a hallmark55. Although muscle deterioration is
a serious problem in astronauts’ health, the effect of gravity
changes on telomeres of muscle cells has not been studied. In
addition, the impact of the effects of radiation on telomere length
are still inconclusive. A study of Chernobyl radiation cleanup
workers demonstrated that occupational exposure to ionizing
radiation led to telomere lengthening in these workers in
peripheral blood leukocytes56. Similar effects were reported for
atomic bomb survivors, but only those who were exposed to
lower doses of radiation, as higher dose radiation exposure led to
telomere attrition in peripheral blood T cells57. However, studies
on telomere length following radiation exposure, speciﬁcally
focusing on the muscle compartment, are nonexistent. Most
importantly, the combined effect of weightlessness-induced
skeletal muscle atrophy and cosmic radiation exposure reported
during spaceﬂight58 led us to query whether these factors can
contribute to changes in telomere dynamics in myogenic cells in a
ground-based mouse model.
HLS in rodents is a common model used to study the effects of
ground-based muscle atrophy, through mechanical unloading and
skeletal muscle disuse59. Using this HLS strategy in mice, we
observed ~20% reductions in gastrocnemius muscle, similar to
what has been previously reported59. Despite this loss of muscle
mass, no changes in telomere length in the HLS model alone were
evident, suggesting that simulated weightless conditions alone
are not sufﬁcient to modify telomere length. To mimic cosmic
radiation exposure in spaceﬂights, we exposed mice to whole-
body ionizing radiation by itself or utilized a combined approach
of HLS and irradiation. Under these conditions, we found telomere
lengthening only in myogenic cell types in the HLS + IR group but
IR exposure alone had minimal impact on telomeres. Intriguingly,
endothelial cells present in the affected muscles do not exhibit
signiﬁcant telomere length changes in either group, suggesting
that telomeres within skeletal muscle cells are more susceptible to
telomere length changes in our experimental system. Overall, the
telomeres in combined radiation exposure and simulated micro-
gravity conditions demonstrated a synergistic telomere lengthen-
ing effect when applied together, speciﬁcally in myogenic cells
but not in other cells with the muscle architecture.
Although many detrimental health effects are associated with
telomere shortening60,61, a growing body of evidence suggests
that very long telomeres may be problematic in human cells, as
these telomeres could develop instabilities and telomeric fragi-
lity62, supporting the notion that tight control of telomere length
homeostasis is essential. In line with this statement, in the Twins
Study, the return to ground astronaut demonstrated a rapid
shortening of telomere length, within 48 h after landing, to levels
below earthbound twin, and telomere length extended but still
remained
shorter
than
the
earthbound
twin,
even
after
9 months26. Similar ﬁndings were found in other astronaut studies
as well26,41. To query whether telomere shortening occurred
within skeletal muscle cells of our experimental design, we
implemented a 2-week recovery period, where mechanical
loading of hindlimb muscles was reestablished. The longer
2-week endpoint compared to the initial 48 h used in the Twins
Study was also chosen due to the fact that skeletal muscles cannot
signiﬁcantly recover from atrophy conditions following 48 h of
mechanical loading63. In contrast to the overall telomere short-
ening of T cells in astronaut studies26, we found that the telomere
length of skeletal muscle cells failed to return to baseline levels,
despite the recovery of muscle mass.
The most common mechanism of telomere elongation is
through the action of the enzyme telomerase42. A role for
telomerase in spaceﬂight-induced telomere elongation has been
suggested for peripheral T cells26. However, telomerase activity
measurements in astronaut studies could not be measured
midﬂight, as the activity of TERT in tissue samples was “lost in
space”, likely hampered by the harsh conditions the samples
experienced before returning to Earth25,26,41. In the mouse study
presented here, TERT expression in skeletal muscles was low and
coincided with low telomerase activity in our experimental groups.
These ﬁndings are in agreement with a prior report that showed
telomerase activity is lost in differentiated skeletal muscle cells43
and suggest that telomerase has minimal role in telomere
elongation in this experimental paradigm. However, it cannot be
ruled out that transient telomerase activity in small proportions of
myogenic cells contributes to our observed telomere-lengthening
phenotype. Our investigation into additional modes of telomere
lengthening uncovered preliminary evidence of an alternative
lengthening (ALT) mechanism engagement. ALT was originally
discovered in immortalized cell lines and subsequently shown to
occur in some human tumors64,65 While evidence is mounting that
ALT can be regulated by environmental and genetic factors in
rapidly proliferating tumor cells44, its modulation and engagement
in
quiescent
non-cancerous
cells
has
not
been
explored,
particularly while maintaining tissue structure. In quiescent
skeletal muscle myogenic cells, we found that there is a
substantial downregulation of the chromatin remodeler Atrx and
the histone chaperone Daxx in both the HLS + IR and the recovery
muscles compared to controls. The biological underpinning of this
downregulation in muscles remains unknown. Observed telomere
lengthening, in conjunction with low telomerase activity and
reduction of Atrx and Daxx expression, are suggestive of the
engagement ALT-type mechanisms. In support of our ﬁndings,
recent evidence has shown telomere lengthening in the blood
cells of Mount Everest climbers during different points of peak
ascent. Based on gene expression analyses, TERT was down-
regulated and RAD50 was upregulated, while ALT and telomere
maintenance via recombination pathways were enriched as the
climbers progressed upwards41. These high-altitude studies, in
which radiation exposure is higher than sea level, add weight to
the validity of our ﬁndings of ALT-related pathway engagement
over a relatively short time frame.
A conundrum of our ﬁndings relates to the fact that cells of
undamaged adult skeletal muscles are quiescent, including the
myogenic cells of our study. Since ALT utilizes some of the same
players of homologous recombinational (HR) repair66, a DNA
double-strand break repair mechanism that is most active during
the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle67, our ﬁndings are
unexpected. However, there is substantial evidence that HR can
occur in the G1 phase of the cell cycle68 and in postmitotic
neurons69. In addition, HR in general occurs at similar frequencies

in ALT proﬁcient and ALT-deﬁcient human cells70, which adds an
additional level of complexity to the understanding of ALT
processes.
Thus,
it
is
therefore
possible
that
telomerase-
independent lengthening may be occurring in our experimental
system, and that reduced expression of Atrx and Daxx supports
the plausibility of a mechanism with features of ALT contributing
to our observations. Until more details emerge on how molecular
signatures associated with ALT are governed in nondividing, non-
cancerous tissues, the speciﬁc mechanisms controlling telomere
lengthening in a cell type-speciﬁc manner in our experimental
design, or in the environment of space, remain elusive.
Overall, this study examined the relationship between skeletal
muscle cells and telomere length dynamics following hindlimb
suspension and irradiation. While these ﬁndings are not extend-
able to post-ﬂight measurements of astronauts, the experimental
design applied here can be of use for preassessments of space-
determined factors that modulate telomere dynamics and skeletal
muscle functionality. One limitation of our study is that we only
use males. Recent studies have demonstrated no sex difference in
adult telomere length in vertebrates71, thus including female mice
in our study is unlikely to change the interpretation of the mouse
results. Yet, studies in humans have revealed differences in
telomere length between sexes, depending on the age examined
and the methodology used72–74. Thus, subsequent studies should
consider telomere differences between sexes, especially given the
rise in the number of female astronauts participating in space
missions, and other reported differences in additional metrics
between the sexes in other spaceﬂight studies75,76. In any event,
the data presented herein demonstrate that a ground-based
model may be a useful starting point in elucidating the
mechanisms governing telomere elongation dynamics in muscles
of astronauts during spaceﬂight.
Another limitation of this study is the type and dose/dose-rate
of radiation exposure and how it relates to astronauts’ occupa-
tional exposure. The space radiation environment is comprised of
high energy protons and galactic cosmic radiation, including but
not limited to electrons, protons, and heavier densely ionizing
charged particles77. Additionally, radiation sources in space are
not constant, and the absorbed dose varies between mice and
humans varies, at least for proton radiation78. Our experimental
outcome in ground-based rodent muscle utilized a single
exposure to a single ionizing radiation source, as it was not
feasible to reload rodent hindlimbs for possible successive
radiation exposures. To ensure radiation exposures were sufﬁcient
during our experimental window, we utilized a radiation dose of
2 Gy, which at current standards, is higher than NASA occupa-
tional exposures79.
A major difference between mice and humans is telomere
length, with many mouse strains having ∼8-fold longer telomeres
than humans80, and they exhibit much faster rates of telomere
shortening than humans81. This greater telomere reservoir could
endow muscle cells in in-bred strains of laboratory mice with a
protective effect in spaceﬂight, but it is equally as possible that
telomere changes are more easily studied in rodent models
because of their differences compared with humans. Skeletal
muscle cell telomere length was not examined in astronaut
studies25,26,65, and muscle biopsies of astronauts in space are rare,
as the risk of complications to their health or possibly jeopardizing
the missions is too great. Thus, future investigations using animal
models in spaceﬂight would presumably mimic the muscle
defects seen in astronauts and would be invaluable. Given the
differences in telomere length between typically used research
mouse strains and humans, future studies could be further
strengthened by utilizing more humanized mice in regard to
telomere length, such as the CAST/Ei J strain82. After being
exposed to the same weightless and cosmic radiation conditions
as humans, these mice may be useful to further investigate
behavior and function of different cell types in relation to their
telomere changes.
In conclusion, the data presented here lay a foundation for
future studies to explore telomere length regulation in skeletal
muscles during spaceﬂight conditions, to investigate whether ALT
drivers exert cell type-speciﬁc inﬂuences on telomere length, and
how long these changes last and how they contribute to health
risks in astronauts after they return to Earth. Identifying the
cellular and molecular muscle changes associated with telomere
lengthening,
as
well
as
how
ALT-related
processes
affect
spaceﬂight-exposed cells, may yield important clues for future
prophylactic therapy of astronauts’ muscles, both during space
ﬂights and upon return to Earth.
METHODS
Mice
Male C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (stock#
000664) and used between 2 and 4 months of age. Experimental
procedures for this project were approved and overseen by the
University of Pennsylvania IACUC committee (protocol #806800).
Following
receipt,
mice
were
acclimated
to
University
of
Pennsylvania rodent housing for 1 week prior to commencing
the experiments. All mice in this study were fed Dietgel boost food
(ClearH2O) and provided hydrogel barrier hydration (ClearH2O) ad
libitum (as the sole nutrition and hydration sources) for the
duration of the experiment.
Full body irradiation
Cohorts of mice were irradiated with ionizing radiation from a 137Cs
irradiator (Gammacell 40 exactor) at a dose-rate of 1.23 cGy/s. Room
air was provided to the mice during the procedure via a vacuum
pump. After 2 Gy exposure, mice were returned to conventional
housing for 1-week, prior HLS.
Hindlimb suspension
Equipment used for hindlimb suspension can be found in
Supplementary Table 1. Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with an
isoﬂurane vaporizer (2.5% v/v isoﬂurane to oxygen), and mouse
tails were wrapped with cloth surgical tape, beginning at the tail
base. After wrapping ~half of the tail length, the tape was folded
on itself to create a loop, and remaining tape was wrapped around
the tail from the midpoint towards the tail base. Through this
closed tape loop, plastic-coated wire was threaded and attached
to a hanging apparatus. The hanging apparatus was placed in a rat
cage with a wire mesh bottom. The hanging apparatus allows for
movement of mice only through use of the forelimbs. Range of
movement of HLS mice was approximately ½ of the rat cage
surface area, but HLS mice were singly housed for the study. Mice
were hung for a period of 3 weeks, with or without a 2-week
recovery period where mice were placed in conventional housing.
Tissue sample collection
At the end point of the study, mice were humanely euthanized by
CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation. Organs of
interest were collected by dissection and weighed. Tissue weights
were normalized to endpoint mouse body weights. Gastrocne-
mius muscles were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS; Thermo) for 2 h on a rocking platform at 4 °C.
Muscles were then incubated overnight in 30% sucrose in water at
4 °C, prior to embedding in OCT (NEG-50; Epredia) and cryofreez-
ing. Muscle cryosections were cut at 10 μm and placed on
superfrost plus slides (Fisher). Slides were stored at −20 °C prior to
staining.

Muscle ﬁber cross-sectional area measurements
Muscle cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 for
10 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA; GeminiBio) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature.
Slides were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated
wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; 1 μg/mL; Thermo) for one hour in
the dark at room temperature, to outline muscle ﬁbers. Slides
were washed in PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong
gold with DAPI (Thermo). Slides were imaged on a Nikon Ni
wideﬁeld microscope equipped with a Plan Fluor 10x/0.30
objective and Nikon DS-Qi1Mc 14-bit camera, and random ﬁelds
per mouse were used for ﬁber area enumeration in Fiji.
Muscle stem cell number quantiﬁcation
Muscle cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 for
10 min, washed with PBS, and underwent heat-mediated antigen
retrieval with EDTA buffer (1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.05% Tween 20).
Slides were washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h at room
temperature with 3% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were
stained with Pax7 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/100; Thermo
#PA1–117) overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and stained with
Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated Goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/300; Thermo)
for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and
coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo).
Whole cryosections were imaged using an Axio Scan z1 slide
scanner (Zeiss) and processed with Zen software. Two cryosec-
tions per mouse were used for quantiﬁcation of the number of
pax7 positive cells per 10μm section with Fiji.
Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity assay
Cryosections from gastrocnemius muscles or mouse kidney were
ﬁxed with 1% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde (Electron
microscopy sciences). Slides were incubated with PBS, pH 6.0 for
30 minutes, followed by incubation with X-gal staining solution
(4 mM potassium ferricyanide, 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide,
2 mM magnesium chloride, 0.02% Igepal CA-630, and 400 μg/mL
X-gal; all from Sigma) for 48 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed with
PBS, and ﬁxed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Slides were washed with
PBS and coverslips were mounted with Fluromount G (South-
ernBiotech). Slides were imaged on a Nikon-Ni wideﬁeld micro-
scope using a Nikon DS-F12 color camera.
Telomere length assessments
Telomere length was measured using the CRYO MuQ-FISH
protocol35. Brieﬂy, muscle cryosections were permeabilized in
0.5% triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, and
underwent heat-mediated antigen retrieval with TET buffer
(10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20) for
10 minutes. Slides were washed in PBS and incubated with RNase
A (100 μg/mL) for 20 minutes at 37 °C. Slides were then incubated
with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated TelC telomere probe (1/600; PNA
bio) in hybridization buffer [15% ethylene carbonate (Sigma), 20%
dextran sulfate (Sigma), 600 mM sodium chloride (Sigma), 1X
antigen
retrieval
citrate
buffer
(Vector
labs)].
Hybridization
occurred by a denaturation step of 67 °C for 10 min and a
hybridization step of 42 °C for 90 min. A glass coverslip was used
to prevent evaporation. Slides were washed in buffers with
decreasing salt concentration (2X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20, 1X SSC;
0.1% Tween-20, 0.5X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20, 0.25X SSC; 0.1% Tween-
20) twice each solution for 5 min each before a ﬁnal rinse in PBS.
Slides were then blocked with 3% BSA/PBS/0.1% triton X-100 for
1 hour. MuSCs were labeled by VCAM1 staining (1/100 of 1 mg/mL
stock; Thermo # PA5–47029), endothelial cells were marked by
CD31biotin (1/100; Thermo #13–0311–82) antibody staining over-
night at 4 °C. Alexa ﬂuor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat
antibody (1/300; Thermo # A11055), or Cy3-streptavidin (1/100;
Thermo) were used to label the cells of interest. After washing
with PBS, glass coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with
DAPI (Thermo). To image telomeres, MuSCs (VCAM1+ in the
satellite cell position), myonuclei (based on position within the
myoﬁbers), or endothelial cells (CD31 + ) were imaged with a
Nikon Plan Apo 100x/1.45 oil objective on a Nikon Ni wideﬁeld
epiﬂuorescence microscope, equipped with a DS-Q1MC mono-
chrome camera. Z stacks of 1 μm thickness from each channel
(telomere, DAPI, cell type) were taken to encompass the entirety
of the telomere ﬁelds. Images were processed using the extended
depth of focus algorithm in the accompanying Nikon elements
microscope software. Images were exported as 16-bit mono-
chrome tiffs and analyzed using the free analysis software,
Telometer
3.0.6
(https://demarzolab.pathology.jhmi.edu/
telometer/download.html). This software allows cells of interest
to be analyzed for telomere signal intensities, and normalizes
these intensities to that of DAPI, to account for differences in cell
cycle position and has been previously validated for use in muscle.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from whole gastrocnemius muscles with
Trizol.
RNA
was
reverse
transcribed
into
cDNA
using
the
Protoscript II ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis kit. (NEB). Multiplexed
quantitative real-time PCR was completed using either FAM-
labeled Tert (ThermoFisher; gene assay id: Mm00436931_m1), Atrx
(ThermoFisher;
gene
assay
id:
Mm00494196_m1),
or
Daxx
(ThermoFisher; gene assay id: Mm00492089_m1), with VIC-
labeled Gapdh (ThermoFisher 4352339e). Reactions were run on
a Quantstudio 6 with accompanying software. Relative gene
expression was determined by the ΔΔCT method, using Gapdh as
a normalizing control.
Immunohistochemistry
Gastrocnemius cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton
X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA; GeminiBio) in PBS for 1 h at room
temperature. Primary antibody to TERT (1/100; RayBiotech #
144–64552–50) was incubated in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C.
Slides were washed the following day with PBS and stained with
Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 555 secondary antibody
(1/300; Thermo #A21428) at room temperature for 1 hour. Slides
were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong
gold with DAPI (Thermo). Slides were imaged on a Nikon-Ni
wideﬁeld microscope using a Nikon DS-F12 color camera.
Telomerase activity measurement by TRAP assay
Relative telomerase activity was measured by Telomere Repeat
Ampliﬁcation Protocol (TRAP) assay as previously described83. In
brief, muscle tissue was lysed in 1X CHAPS buffer for 30 minutes on
ice. Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000×g for 20 min to pellet
cell debris and protein concentration was measured by Bradford
assay. One hundred twenty-ﬁve nanograms of protein lysate was
incubated with a telomerase substrate at 30 °C for 30 minutes to
allow for telomerase to catalyze the addition of telomere repeats to
the substrate. The reactions were then PCR ampliﬁed, resolved on a
4–20% TBE polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 30 minutes and
visualized by staining with SYBR Green nucleic acid gel stain.
Relative telomerase activity was quantiﬁed using ImageJ software.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed statistically using GraphPad (La Jolla, CA, USA)
Prism 9.5.1 software. Results are presented as the mean± or SEM
for column graphs, with individual data points representative of a
single mouse dataset, or as median with 25th and 75th quartiles
