differently to extended microgravity

The effects of spaceﬂight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To address this deﬁciency, articular cartilage (AC) and
sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological
changes. The ﬂight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction
in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-ﬂight controls. These data
suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no
evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC ﬂight samples and the gene expression proﬁle was distinct from that of AC with a reduction
in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned
to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal
terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not
minimally loaded sternal ﬁbrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity. We speculate that the maintenance
of physiological loading on AC during spaceﬂight will minimize AC damage.

INTRODUCTION
The major load-bearing tissue within the joint is articular cartilage
(AC). AC is exquisitely sensitive to changes in biomechanical
loading (reviewed by Sanchez-Adams et al.1). Under normal
conditions, chondrocytes synthesize a balance of extracellular
matrix (ECM) components so that the ability to resist tensile and
compressive forces is maintained. Deviation from the normal range
of biomechanical forces,2–5 including complete unloading,6–8 tips
the balance from maintenance to pathology typically leading to
cartilage erosion and later osteoarthritis. While the effects of the
biomechanical unloading environment of spaceﬂight on bone and
skeletal muscle are well-studied,9,10 the effects on AC are largely
unknown. The responses of AC to microgravity are important to
deﬁne because it is clear from clinical studies that load-bearing AC
is different from bone and skeletal tissue in that has a very poor
capacity to restore damaged tissue.11 Consequently, microgravity-
induced joint pathology could compromise ﬂight crew mobility,
interfere with mission activities, and accelerate short- and long-
term joint degradation in ﬂight personnel.
To investigate the effect of extended microgravity on AC, joint
tissue from mice exposed to 30 days of Spaceﬂight in the BION-M1
ﬂight was assessed for evidence of cartilage degradation. Our data
suggest that spaceﬂight results in tissue degradation in load-
bearing AC, but not in minimally loaded sternal ﬁbrocartilage.
RESULTS
Articular cartilage
Spaceﬂight (SF) AC samples demonstrated less proteoglycan
compared to AC ground controls (GC) (Fig. 1a). Decreased
proteoglycan levels were generally restricted to the femoral
condyle rather than the tibial plateau. Analysis of the boxed
regions drawn around areas of reduced proteoglycan staining
indicates approximately 35% of chondrocytes within the box stain
for pericellular proteoglycan. Virtually no superﬁcial zone chon-
drocytes have pericellular staining with the majority of toluidine
blue-stained cells residing in the middle zone. Collagen II levels
were similar between SF and control samples although three SF
samples showed evidence of surface damage (Fig. 1b). In addition,
clear evidence of osteophyte formation was present in three SF
samples and in one GC and one SFV control sample (Fig. 1c). One
SF femur sample was <2/3 the thickness of the average GC
thickness.
The
SF
mice
had
a
signiﬁcantly
worse
overall
histological scores compared to all of the non-ﬂight control
groups, suggesting more overall cartilage degradation (Fig. 1d).
Electron microscopy analysis of AC of elbows revealed no major
differences in matrix density between SF and GC samples
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Gene expression analysis showed several
sustained changes in gene activation in SF compared to GC
samples. Ten genes were upregulated and 37 genes down-
regulated greater than two-fold in ﬂight compared to ground with
a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 (Fig. 2a). Seventeen of the
altered genes are structural cartilage ECM proteins or proteins
associated with joint pathology.
Sternal cartilage
The availability of sternal tissue allowed us to compare the
response of the two cartilages to microgravity. Representative
images of the same cartilaginous sternocostal synchondrosis in
the region between incoming ribs and ossiﬁed sternebrae are

shown in Fig. 1e. This tissue is cartilaginous because it expresses
the cartilage-speciﬁc gene Col10a1 according to microarray gene
expression data (not shown). In contrast to AC, there was no
difference in extent and overall levels of proteoglycan staining
between SF and GC samples in the sternal cartilage (SC),
indicating no microgravity-induced proteoglycan decrease. Gene
expression analyses demonstrated that 30 sternal genes were
upregulated and 35 were downregulated in SF compared to GC
(Fig. 2b).
DISCUSSION
The ﬁnding of reduced proteoglycan levels in AC due to
microgravity is consistent with hindlimb unloading and limb
immobilization studies in rodents, dogs, and rabbits, which
consistently report unloading-speciﬁc AC atrophy in multiple
experimental situations (reviewed in ref. 8). Our data suggest that
despite partial proteoglycan reduction, the collagen II network
remains intact. While surface damage and osteophytes were
noted in several SF animals, there was no evidence of widespread

AC ﬁbrillation or ﬁssure formation, and we conclude that exposure
to microgravity results in moderate surface damage. Some
chondrocytes were stained strongly for proteoglycan immediately
surrounding the cell and may represent the production of new
proteoglycan in the time elapsed (12–13 h) since returning to
normal gravity although glycosaminoglycan synthesis assays are
needed to conﬁrm this.
Nine of the downregulated genes in spaceﬂight encode
structural
ECM
components,
including
ﬁbromodulin
(fmod),
osteoglycin (Ogn), osteomodulin (Omd), decorin (Dcn), dermato-
pontin (Dpt), PRELP (Prelp) collagen X (Col10a1), thrombospondin4
(Tsp4), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Several
other non-structural components with important cartilage ECM
roles in development or osteoarthritis were also downregulated,
including proteoglycan-related gene 4/lubricin (Prg4), procollagen
C-endopeptidase enhancer 2 (Pcolce2), and Cytokine-like 1 (Cytl1).
Cytl1 is an autocrine factor that regulates chondrogenesis in
mesenchymal cells12 and is required for cartilage homeostasis.13
Expression of Prg4 by superﬁcial zone chondrocytes is acutely
mechanosensitive; upregulation occurs with loading and asso-
ciated with protection against osteoarthritis.14–17
The decrease in proteoglycan levels and downregulation of
ECM molecules and genes that protect against osteoarthritic
changes suggest that the early stages of cartilage breakdown are
underway in the ﬂight AC after 30 days of microgravity. However,
since there is no evidence of signiﬁcant collagen II degradation
and the possible re-synthesis of proteoglycan in some chondro-
cytes, we suggest that cartilage recovery is possible and that
30 days of microgravity is insufﬁcient for irreversible cartilage
degradation.
In SC, there was no evidence of proteoglycan loss and a
different suite of genes was altered in spaceﬂight. Of the
downregulated genes, most notable were two prominent cartilage
ECM-degrading
enzymes:
Mmp13
and
Mmp9.
This
ﬁnding
together with the downregulation of S100a8 and S100a9, which
are known to stimulate Mmp gene activation in cartilage,18
suggest that less ECM proteolysis occurs in SF samples compared
to non-ﬂight samples in SC tissue.
The expression of several genes was altered in both cartilage
tissues, including Prg4 and Omd, but opposite directions in the
two cartilages. Osteomodulin regulates ﬁbril diameter and is
suggestive of new matrix synthesis in SC and reduced matrix
production in AC.19 Prg4 is chondroprotective and its upregulation
in SC is further evidence that SC may be protected from
degradation in microgravity.
Based on these differences in response to microgravity between
the two cartilages, we suggest that the relative change in
biomechanical environment determines the tissue response.
During normal activities, AC is cyclically loaded with a signiﬁcant
fraction of body weight and then almost completely unloaded in
microgravity. This change in loading triggers cartilage breakdown.
In contrast, SC is loaded by cyclical lung expansion but does not
experience the same magnitude of compressive loading as AC.
Since
the
mice
continue
to
breathe
in
microgravity
and
continuously load the tissue, the difference between mechanical
loading in SF and controls is minimal, and cartilage breakdown is
not initiated in SC.
Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that maintenance of
biomechanical loading during spaceﬂight will minimize AC
destruction.
METHODS
Animals
C57BL/6N male mice were ﬂown for 30 days (477 Earth orbits) on the
unmanned BION-M1 biosatellite between 19 April and 19 May 2013.20
Tissues were acquired from six male ﬂight mice as part of NASA’s
Biospecimen Sharing Program. The mice were speciﬁc pathogen-free and
19–20 weeks old at the time of launch and start of control experiments. In
addition to the six ﬂight mice (SF), there were eight “ﬂight” vivarium male
ground control mice (SFV), seven asynchronous ground control males (GC),
and seven asynchronous vivarium ground control males (GCV). Tissues
were harvested 12–13 h post-landing. Flight and animal habitat details for
the BION-M1 mission have been reported by Andreev-Andrievskiy et al.20
IACUC approval was obtained from the MSU Institute of Mitoengineer-
ing and of the Biomedical Ethics Commission of IBMP and the study was
conducted in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection
of Vertebrate animals used for Experimental and Other Scientiﬁc purposes.
Tissue analyses
Hindlimbs and elbow joints were dissected and right limbs placed in
RNALater (Ambion) with left limbs placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
(NBF). Sternae with ribs attached were cut mid-sternum and the posterior
half containing xiphoid process and two sternocostal joints placed in
RNALater and the anterior half placed in NBF for histology. AC processing,
toluidine blue histology and immunohistochemistry, were performed as
previously reported.21 AC sections were stained for Safranin-O (Saf-O) and
counterstained with hematoxylin using a protocol from the University of
Rochester,
Center
for
Musculoskeletal
Research
(https://www.urmc.
rochester.edu/musculoskeletal-research/core-services/histology/protocols.
aspx). Cartilage thickness measurements were taken along the tibial and
femoral articular surfaces of Saf-O positive AC at 30 different sites for each
section in the same relative position throughout the joint and included
calciﬁed and non-calciﬁed regions together. These within-animal measure-
ments were used to derive an average thickness for each animal. The
thickness variation within an experimental group was similar to the
average variation within individual samples (not shown).
For transmission electron microscopy, cartilage samples from SF and GC
elbows
were
dissected
from
bone
and
post-ﬁxed
in
0.5%
(v/v)
osmiumtetroxide and 1% (w/v) potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer. After dehydration, specimens were incubated in
propylenoxide and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut,
collected on copper grids, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate.
Electron micrographs were taken at 60 kV with a Phillips EM-410 electron
microscope (Ditabis, Pforzheim, Germany).
RNA analyses
RNALater-preserved AC from the femoral condyle and proximal tibia was
dissected down to the calciﬁed zone using an ophthalmic scalpel and
tissue from SF and GC animals pooled separately. Half sternum pieces were
dissected from ribs and SC dissected from bony segments and pooled.
RNA was isolated using the MirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies)
and ampliﬁed by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. Samples
(100 ng) were then labeled using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Plus
protocol and hybridized to an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST GeneChip.
Analysis of microarray data was conducted using both Microarray Suite
(MAS) version 5.0 and Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA).22 Differentially
expressed genes were ≥−2 (decrease) or a fold change of ≥2 (increase)
with an FDR of 0.05.
Statistical analyses
For the AC histological scoring analysis, measurements were taken from
seven GC, seven GCV, ﬁve SF, and six SFV samples where good joint
histology in the correct plane was obtained. Histology scoring for SC was
conducted on six SF, seven GC, eight SFV, and seven GCV animals. Each
animal received a single histology score representing the sum of separate
histological parameters shown in Supplementary Table 1 with higher
scores representing more overall cartilage degradation. Statistical differ-
ences between experimental groups (GC, GCV, SF, SFV) for total
histological
scores
from
each
animal
were
examined
using
the
Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple independent samples (http://astatsa.com/
KruskalWallisTest/).23 The omnibus P-value of 0.006 (d.f. = 3) rejects the
null hypothesis that all groups have the same distribution. Post-hoc
pairwise multiple testing by Dunn was used to determine which pairs are
different.24 P-values were adjusted according to the family-wide error rate
of Holm and then by the Benjamini–Hochberg method.25 P-values for all
pairwise comparisons used to calculate overall Kruskal–Wallis P-values are
shown in Supplementary Table 2. Median, maximum score, minimum
score, and 25th and 75th percentile of total histology data plotted for each
experimental group are shown in Fig. 1d.
