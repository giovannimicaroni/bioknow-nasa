Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause signiﬁcant skeletal muscle atrophy
and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The
sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the
cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently
demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-ﬂown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is
severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS),
to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether
treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)
porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We
received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the
international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceﬂight signiﬁcantly
reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and signiﬁcantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure
of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE
treatment. In conclusion, we ﬁnd that spaceﬂight induces signiﬁcant soleus muscle atrophy and SR
Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate
alternative therapeutics that are speciﬁcally aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing
Ca2+ leak.
Exposure to microgravity, and subsequent muscle unloading, is known to
causeextensivemuscleweaknessandatrophy,especiallytoposturalmuscles
such as the soleus1–6. Recent work has demonstrated that muscle weakness
precedes muscle atrophy4 and was thought to be due, at least in part, to Ca2+
dysregulation7. Using soleus muscle samples from the rodent research (RR)
-1 and -9 missions, we demonstrated the Ca2+ uptake ability of the sarco
(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump to be severely
impaired following ~1 month of spaceﬂight5. In muscle, SERCA is
responsible for maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i)
by bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic
reticulum (SR)8,9. Impaired SERCA function can result in high [Ca2+]i,
leading to elevated RONS, increased protein degradation, cell death, and
muscle weakness and atrophy10–14. Structurally, SERCA pumps are highly
susceptible to post-translational modiﬁcations (e.g., tyrosine nitration,
cysteine nitrosylation) from elevated RONS that will impair its catalytic
activity 5,15–22. The ensuing elevated [Ca2+]i will not only lead to muscle
damage but can also further increase RONS production23–25 creating a
negative cyclic relationship that perpetuates muscle pathology.
While damaging at high concentrations, RONS are important signal-
ing molecules at low concentrations26. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a
family of enzymes that maintain physiological RONS concentrations by
scavenging and neutralizing highly reactive superoxide molecules (for
review, see ref. 27). Mice deﬁcient of SOD show impaired SERCA activity,
muscle weakness, and atrophy11,20,22; but, the pharmacological activation of
SERCA can reduce mitochondrial RONS production and attenuate muscle
atrophydespite increased oxidative stress11,12. Thus, targetingSERCA, either
through genetic overexpression or pharmacological intervention, may be a
viable target to attenuate muscle atrophy and weakness. The purpose of this
study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with Manganese(III)
meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin,
MnTnBuOE-
2-PyP5+ (BuOE, also seen as BMX-001), an antioxidant that acts as a
SOD mimetic28,29, could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction

in the murine soleusmusclefollowing35days of spaceﬂight.BuOEhas been
effective in reducing oxidative stress in various animal models of radiation-
induced injury30–33, a relevant injury mechanism to spaceﬂight, providing
strong rationale for the investigation of its effectiveness in the present study.
Following 35 days of exposure to microgravity, absolute soleus weight
was signiﬁcantly reduced in the ﬂight groups compared to GC/VIV groups
(p = 0.0005) with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 1A). No effects of ﬂight
or treatment were observed on body weight (Fig. 1B) resulting in a main
effect of ﬂight reducing the soleus:body weight ratio (p = 0.0053, Fig. 1C).
Ionophore supported Ca2+-dependent SERCA ATPase activity was
assessed across a range of [Ca2+] (pCa 7.0–5.0) and was presented as per-
centageofmaximalactivity(Fig.2A)toassessthepCa50(i.e.,[Ca2+]required
to elicit ½ maximal activity) as a measure of SERCA’s apparent afﬁnity for
Ca2+. There was no effect of spaceﬂight or BuOE treatment on maximal
SERCA ATPase activity (Fig. 2B), but a main effect of BuOE treatment
increasing SERCA’s apparent afﬁnity for Ca2+ was detected (p = 0.0323, Fig.
2C). In dividing the maximal ATPase rates with ionophore (no Ca2+ gra-
dient) by the rates without ionophore (Ca2+ gradient), a measure of SR Ca2+
permeabilityand leakcan be obtained34–36.Indoingthis,weobservedamain
effect of ﬂight reducing the ionophore ratio (p = 0.0255, Fig. 2D), indicative
of increased SR Ca2+ leak.
Western
blotting
revealed
signiﬁcant
increases
in
SERCA1a
(p = 0.0039) and SERCA2a (p = 0.0107) protein content in the spaceﬂight
groups compared to GC/VIV with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 2E).
Total and phosphorylated content of the Ca2+ release protein, RYR, was also
investigated with no effects on total RYR, but increases in p-RYR (increases
Ca2+ release) in ﬂight groups compared to GC/VIV, though this did not
reach statistical signiﬁcance (p = 0.0905, Fig. 2E).
4-HNE is a product of lipid peroxidation due to increased RONS and
therefore serves as a marker of oxidative stress37. Signiﬁcant increases in
4-HNE were observed in ﬂight groups compared to GC/VIV (p = 0.0387)
with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 3A). Further, total SOD content was
reduced in ﬂight groups compared to controls, though this did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance (p = 0.0510, Fig. 3A). Investigating protein content of
the three SERCA regulators demonstrated dynamic changes in response to
spaceﬂight. Signiﬁcant reductions in SLN (p = 0.0080), increases in NNAT
(p = 0.0158), and reductions in PLN approaching statistical signiﬁcance
(p = 0.0828) were all observed in the space-ﬂown soleus compared to GC/
VIV (Fig. 3B).
To extend our previous work demonstrating that soleus SERCA Ca2+
uptake is impaired following spaceﬂight, which we attributed to increased
RONS content5, we investigated whether treatment with the antioxidant,
BuOE, could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction following
spaceﬂight. We found BuOE was unable to attenuate soleus muscle atrophy
following 35 days in space. While BuOE treatment increased SERCA’s
afﬁnity for Ca2+ in both the GC/VIV and ﬂight groups, it was unable to
rescue the signiﬁcant increases in 4-HNE content or SR Ca2+ leak, measured
using an ionophore ratio, induced by microgravity exposure. Consistent
with previous work5, we observed increases in protein content of both
SERCA isoforms following spaceﬂight as well as increases in oxidative stress
and dynamic changes in the expression of the three SERCA regulators, SLN,
NNAT, and PLN. Spaceﬂight also tended to reduce SOD content and
increase p-RYR, both of which may be contributing to increased SR
Ca2+ leak.
Past literature using both ground-based and spaceﬂight models in
rodents and humans has begun to suggest that Ca2+ dysregulation in
skeletal muscle may be an early step in the pathogenesis of weakness
and atrophy4,5,38. Speciﬁcally, we have previously shown the Ca2+
uptake ability of SERCA to be impaired following spaceﬂight which we
attributed, at least partially, to increases in total protein RONS5.
SERCA pumps have highly susceptible tyrosine residues that, in the
presence of increased RONS, can result in tyrosine nitration15–18.
Tyrosine 294 and 295 of SERCA appear to be most vulnerable to tyr-
osine nitration and reside in the transmembrane domain of the pump, a
necessary domain for Ca2+ translocation16. The structural changes that
ensue following tyrosine nitration of these residues result in impaired
catalytic activity and increased [Ca2+]i. Here, we investigated ATPase
activity of the SERCA pump and found no changes in response to
microgravity; though, we do observe a main effect of BuOE treatment
increasing SERCA’s afﬁnity for Ca2+. This is consistent with our pre-
vious work showing that heterozygous deletion of SOD2 reduces
SERCA’s afﬁnity for Ca2+20. The increases in both SERCA isoforms
with spaceﬂight are consistent with our previous work5 and were
similarly unable to attenuate spaceﬂight-induced increases in [Ca2+]i.
Given that SERCA density is the primary determinant of Ca2+ uptake39
the increased protein content should increase SERCA catalytic activity;
however, this was not detected, suggesting protein dysfunction or a
failed compensatory response. The mechanism underlying increased
SERCA protein expression following spaceﬂight requires further
investigation but has been observed in other muscle-wasting diseases
and myopathies21,40,41. SLN and PLN act to reduce SERCA-mediated
Ca2+ uptake through reductions in afﬁnity as well as inducing Ca2+
slippage42–44; however, no effects of BuOE were detected on the protein
expression of SLN, NNAT, or PLN with the only changes being
observed with spaceﬂight. With regards to the SERCA regulators,
inconsistencies were observed with the previous RR-9 mission where

there was a clear increase in SLN and decrease in NNAT following
spaceﬂight5; but, RR-18 shows the opposite with reductions in SLN and
increases in NNAT, which is maintained even when loaded on the same
gel (Supplemental Fig. 1A, B). At present, we can only speculate that
possible differences in reloading time (~20 h for RR-1845 and ~38 h for
RR-946) would lead to altered expression patterns, but this warrants
further investigation.
It has been well established that Ca2+ accumulates in the cytosol of
muscle ﬁbers following unloading7,47–51 and we also contribute to the
growing literature on Ca2+ dysregulation by demonstrating that SR Ca2+
leak is signiﬁcantly increased in the murine soleus following microgravity
exposure, consistent with what has been reported with hindlimb
suspension52. Increased SR Ca2+ leak has been observed in various muscle
pathologies,manyofwhicharerelatedtopost-translationalmodiﬁcationsof
RYR and its regulators53–56. Here, we observed increases in phosphorylated
RYR, albeit non-statistically signiﬁcant, that may still be contributing to
increased Ca2+ leak.Notably,previousworkhasdemonstrated thatblocking
L-type Ca2+ channels attenuates unloading-induced Ca2+ overload inthe rat
soleus57. In addition to alterations to RYR, the lipid composition of the SR
membrane can also drastically alter Ca2+ handling34,58,59. More speciﬁcally, it
has been shown that increased lipid peroxidation will increase membrane
permeability60–62 and with signiﬁcant increases in 4-HNE, a product of lipid
peroxidation37, in the space-ﬂown soleus, it is likely that alterations to SR
permeability are contributing to increased Ca2+ leak, though more targeted
studies are required. As well as SR Ca2+ leak, there are several other
mechanisms that can lead to elevations in [Ca2+]i that were not explored in
the present study. One such mechanism is early muscle membrane depo-
larization, due to reduced Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity63,64, possibly
triggering the opening of the voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptors
and increasing [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ overload may also be a product of store-
operatedCa2+entry-theprocessofCa2+inﬂuxtriggeredbyreductionsinSR
luminal [Ca2+] (for review, see ref. 65), which could be triggered by SERCA
dysfunction. This phenomenon has been identiﬁed to contribute to Ca2+
overload in dystrophic muscle66,67 and various other myopathies68, though
its contributions to muscle atrophy and weakness following unloading
remain to be explored.
In skeletal muscle, BuOE was unable to attenuate the increases in
4-HNE caused by spaceﬂight; but, was effective in reducing 4-HNE in the
retina from the same mice45, indicative of tissue-speciﬁc responses to BuOE
at the dose provided in this study. Though speculative, it is possible that
BuOE was unable to compensate for the reductions in SOD content
observed following spaceﬂight, an effect also seen in astronaut muscle fol-
lowingspaceﬂight,albeitinhairsamples69.Futurestudiesfocusedonskeletal
muscle, namely SERCA function in the soleus, may beneﬁt from higher
doses of BuOE treatment or other modes of cytotoxic protection. For
example, HSP70 can protect SERCA from oxidant damage in conditions of
muscular dystrophy70, and it would be of interest to determine whether
pharmacological induction or genetic overexpression of HSP70 could
protect SERCA function inthecontextof spaceﬂight. While we were limited
in our ability to measure the sources of RONS in this study, previous work

effect of BuOE increasing the pCa50 was found (C). The ionophore ratio was
signiﬁcantly reduced in spaceﬂight groups with no effect of BuOE (D). Densito-
metric analysis and representative western blot images show signiﬁcant increases in
SERCA1a and SERCA2a protein content in the space-ﬂown soleus (E). All values are

has demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction71,72, and increased NADPH
oxidase expression and activity73,74 to contribute to RONS production with
spaceﬂight and simulated microgravity exposure. Further investigation into
whether targeting RONS production at the source can counteract muscle
weaknessand atrophyisneeded.Regardless,targetingCa2+ leakfromtheSR
has shown to be beneﬁcial to muscle health in aged mice75, hypoxia-induced
atrophy in rodents76, and murine dystrophic muscle77 indicating that this
may be a viable target for spaceﬂight-induced changes in SR permeability
and leak. Importantly, a recent study by Sharlo, et al. 78 treated rats with the
SERCA activator, CDN1163, during hindlimb suspension (NASA’s simu-
lated model of microgravity) and, while they didn’t measure SERCA
function directly, they found improvements in several muscle parameters
including soleus fatigue resistance, mitochondrial markers, and markers of
Ca2+ homeostasis. This ﬁnding, along with others targeting SERCA acti-
vation in situations of muscle impairment11,12 demonstrate the importance
of directly targeting SERCA in space.
We observe some discrepancies related to SLN expression following
spaceﬂight betweenthe RR-95 and the present RR-18 study. SLN expression
has been shown to upregulated in several muscle-wasting conditions, but
whether this upregulation is beneﬁcial or detrimental to muscle is still under
debate (for review, see ref. 79). Procedurally, the RR-1, RR-9, and RR-18
studies allmaintained mouse strainandhousingtemperature but disparities
in reloading time prior to euthanasia (RR-9, ~38 h46; RR-18, ~20 h45) may
contribute to the differences in SLN expression between missions. This
hypothesis remains speculative but would be an interesting avenue of
investigation in the future. Finally, due to limitations on the amount of
sample, we were unable to investigate SERCA-speciﬁc analysis of RONS
modiﬁcations which could provide insight into the changes in Ca2+ afﬁnity
observed here.
In summary, with soleus muscles from space-ﬂown male mice, we
investigated the effects of antioxidant treatment with BuOE on soleus
muscle atrophy, SERCA ATPase function, and SR Ca2+ leak. We found
spaceﬂight to induce soleus muscle atrophy and increases in SR Ca2+ leak
that could not be overcome by BuOE treatment, despite increases in SER-
CA’s afﬁnity for Ca2+. Future studies aimed at reducing Ca2+ leak or
increasing SERCA activation could reveal SERCA and Ca2+ handling as
viabletargetstocounteractweaknessandatrophyobserved withspaceﬂight.
Methods
Muscle samples
Soleus muscles were obtained from the NASA Biological Institutional Sci-
entiﬁc Collection. Muscles came from male C57BL/6 J mice from the RR-18
mission which had two control groups, ground control (GC) and vivarium
(VIV) control, as well as a ﬂight group which had mice housed on the
International Space Station for 35 days as previously described5,45,80–83. All
mice were treated weekly with either BuOE (1 mg/kg) or saline via sub-
cutaneous injection beginning one week prior to launch and continuing for
the duration of spaceﬂight. Upon live return to Earth, soleus muscles were
dissected and stored in RNALater at −80 °C. Muscles were thawed, rinsed
from RNALater, and homogenized in homogenizing buffer prior to further
analysis5.
SERCA activity assay and ionophore ratio
SERCA ATPase activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked spectro-
photometric assay as previously described19. Full SERCA ATPase-pCa
curves were run in the presence of ionophore as well as in the absence of
ionophore speciﬁcally at maximal stimulating Ca2+ concentrations (pCa =
5.0) to gain a measure of SR Ca2+ leak and permeability as previously
described34–36. The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 induces SR membrane per-
meability, which encourages maximal SERCA activity by preventing back
inhibition.Thus,iftheSRmembraneisinherently‘leaky’thenthecalculated
ionophore ratio (maximal SERCA activity in the presence of ionophore:
maximal SERCA activity in the absence of ionophore) will be relatively
smaller.
Western blotting
Western blotting was performed on muscle homogenate to assess protein
content for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, total and phosphorylated content of the
Ca2+ release protein ryanodine receptor (RYR1/2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-
HNE) as a marker of oxidative stress, SOD,and the three SERCA regulators,
Fig. 3 | BuOE treatment does not attenuate
increased oxidative stress following spaceﬂight.
Densitometric analysis and representative western
blots show signiﬁcant increases in 4-HNE following
spaceﬂight and reductions in SOD approaching
statistical signiﬁcance with no effects of BuOE
treatment (A). Protein content of the three SERCA
regulators shows signiﬁcant reductions in SLN and
PLN and signiﬁcant increases in NNAT following
spaceﬂight (B). All values are mean ± SEM with p-
values presented in bars.

sarcolipin (SLN), neuronatin (NNAT), and phospholamban (PLN) as
previously described5,19. Speciﬁc methods for the aforementioned proteins
are listed in Supplemental Table 1.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). No
statistical differences were detected between the GC and VIV groups and so
they were combined within their respective treatment groups to increase
statisticalpower.Atwo-wayANOVAwithTukey’sposthoctestwasusedto
compare the main effects of GC/VIV vs ﬂight and saline vs BuOE as well as
any interaction that may exist. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p ≤0.05 and
outliers were detected and removed prior to analysis if they were ±2 stan-
dard deviations from the mean of their respective group. All statistical tests
were employed using GraphPad Prism 9. p-values are presented above
graphs.
