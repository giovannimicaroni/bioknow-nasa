Control of bioﬁlms requires rapid methods to identify compounds effective against them and to isolate
resistance-compromised mutants for identifying genes involved in enhanced bioﬁlm resistance. While rapid
screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) bioﬁlms are available, there are no methods for such
screening of continuous ﬂow bioﬁlms (“ﬂow bioﬁlms”). Since the latter bioﬁlms more closely approximate
natural bioﬁlms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe
here a new method using a device comprised of microﬂuidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump
(BioFlux) that provides ﬂuid ﬂow to 96 individual bioﬁlms. This device allows ﬁne control of continuous or
intermittent ﬂuid ﬂow over a broad range of ﬂow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides
compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria,
staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of ﬂuorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and
accurate determination of bioﬁlm viability. The bioﬁlm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with
that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of ﬂuorescence microscope image analysis. Using
BioFlux and the plate reader, we were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the viability
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 ﬂow bioﬁlms.
Bacterial bioﬁlms are surface-attached communities that are
encased in a polymeric matrix, which exhibit a high degree of
resistance to antimicrobial agents and the host immune system
(12, 16). This makes them medically important; diseases with a
bioﬁlm component are chronic and difﬁcult to eradicate. Ex-
amples of such diseases are cystitis (1), endocarditis (31), cystic
ﬁbrosis (35), and middle-ear (17) and indwelling medical de-
vice-associated (20) infections. Bioﬁlms also play important
environmental roles in, for example, wastewater treatment
(38), bioremediation (29, 30), biofouling (7), and biocorrosion
(2). Better control of bioﬁlms requires elucidation of the mo-
lecular basis of their superior resistance (by identifying resis-
tance-compromised mutants) and identiﬁcation of compounds
with antibioﬁlm activity. While our understanding of these
aspects of bioﬁlms has increased (11, 15, 25–27, 36), further
work, including development of accurate high-throughput
(HTP) methods for screening bioﬁlm viability, is needed.
Two major bioﬁlm models are studied in the laboratory,
bioﬁlms grown without a continuous ﬂow of fresh medium and
bioﬁlms grown with a continuous ﬂow of fresh medium; exam-
ples of these two models are microtiter well bioﬁlms and ﬂow
cell bioﬁlms, respectively. Methods have been developed for
HTP screening of the viability of static bioﬁlms (6, 28, 32, 33),
but there are no methods for HTP screening of ﬂow bioﬁlms.
The latter bioﬁlms are typically grown in ﬂow cells, which have
to be examined individually to determine viability and thus
cannot be used for rapid screening. An HTP screening method
for ﬂow bioﬁlms is desirable, as these bioﬁlms more closely
approximate natural bioﬁlms and can differ from static bioﬁlms
evidently due to hydrodynamic inﬂuences on cell signaling (22,
34). For example, the ability of rpoS-deﬁcient Escherichia coli
(lacking S) to form ﬂow bioﬁlms is impaired, but its capacity
to form bioﬁlms under static conditions is enhanced (18).
We describe here a new application of a recently developed
device (8–10, 13), the “BioFlux” device consisting of microﬂu-
idic channels for bioﬁlm growth. Other microﬂuidic devices
have recently been used for bioﬁlm formation (14, 19, 21, 23),
but none of them has been used for HTP screening. The
BioFlux device permits rapid measurement of the ﬂuorescence
of ﬂow bioﬁlms with a plate reader, which permits initial HTP
screening of the viability of such bioﬁlms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and media. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strain AMG1, a
clinical isolate obtained from the Infectious Disease Department at the Stanford
Medical Center (25), was cultured in Lennox L broth (LB). Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa PAO1 and Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens 700830 were cultured in Bacto tryptic
soy broth (TSB). To obtain a green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-expressing strain,
UPEC was transformed by electroporation with plasmid pFPV25.1 (37). PAO1
carrying pSMC2 (4) for GFP expression was graciously provided by Terry Ma-
chen (University of California, Berkeley). Ampicillin was added to the medium
to maintain the expression vectors (100 and 16 g/ml for UPEC/pFPV25.1 and
PAO1/pSMC2, respectively). LB agar and Difco tryptic soy agar (TSA) were
used for plating the UPEC and PAO1 strains, respectively.
Growth and determination of the viability of microtiter plate (“static”) bio-
ﬁlms. Static bioﬁlms of GFP-expressing strains were grown in Costar 96-well
polystyrene plates (with black walls to prevent interference between wells due to
ﬂuorescence) as described previously (25, 36). Brieﬂy, overnight cultures were
diluted 1:100 in LB (for UPEC) or TSB (for PAO1), and 100 l was dispensed
into each well and incubated for 24 h and 37°C. After a rinse with saline (0.85%),
eight replicate bioﬁlms were treated with a saline bleach solution using concen-
trations speciﬁed below; treatment with saline alone was used as a control.
Following 1 h of treatment and a saline rinse, bioﬁlm viability was determined in
parallel using colony counting as well as measurement of ﬂuorescence. For
colony counting, quadruplicate bioﬁlms were resuspended in saline and pooled
in glass tubes. The bioﬁlms were broken up by vigorous vortexing and were
serially diluted in saline. Then 25-l portions of three dilutions were plated in
duplicate on LB agar (UPEC) or TSA (PAO1) plates. After 12 h of incubation

at 37°C, colonies were counted, and the results were compared to the results for
saline-treated controls.
For measurement of ﬂuorescence, the remaining four replicate bioﬁlms were
stained with 100 l of a saline solution containing 30 M propidium iodide (PI)
for 30 min, and then the wells were washed and reﬁlled with saline. Empty
microtiter wells (without bioﬁlms) were stained similarly and then washed and
reﬁlled with saline and used as blanks to measure the background ﬂuorescence.
Fluorescence emission spectra (505 to 650 nm, with 5-nm steps) were measured
with a Saﬁre ﬂuorescence plate reader (Tecan, Ma¨nnedorf, Switzerland) with
excitation at 488 nm. The background ﬂuorescence was subtracted from the
emission spectra, and the ratio of green ﬂuorescence (integrated from 505 to 525
nm) to red ﬂuorescence (integrated from 605 to 625 nm) was calculated for each
bioﬁlm. The absolute ﬂuorescence values were a product of the ﬂuorescence per
cell and the number of cells in the bioﬁlm. Following treatment, static bioﬁlms
were rinsed prior to PI staining, which could result in removal of some bioﬁlm.
Using the ratio of green ﬂuorescence to red ﬂuorescence compensated for this
effect. The ﬂuorescence of saline-treated control bioﬁlms was designated 100%
viable, and the ﬂuorescence of bioﬁlms treated with 0.2% bleach was designated
0% viable (in agreement with colony count data). Intermediate levels of viability
were calculated by linear interpolation between the green ﬂuorescence/red ﬂu-
orescence ratios for the 100% viable bioﬁlms (treated with saline) and the 0%
viable bioﬁlms (treated with 0.2% bleach).
Bioﬁlm growth and determination of viability for the BioFlux ﬂowthrough
device. The BioFlux device (Fluxion Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA),
which allows simultaneous cultivation of 96 ﬂow bioﬁlms, is described in the
Results. To grow bioﬁlms in this device, the microﬂuidic channels (depth, 70 m;
width, 370 m) were wetted with medium and inoculated with an overnight
culture (whose concentration was adjusted so that the optical density at 600 nm
[OD600] in medium was 0.1). To obtain time course images, P. ﬂuorescens was
grown in TSB with a ﬂow rate of 186 l/h (2 cm/s). We found that with full-
strength TSB there was inconsistent formation of fully formed bioﬁlms due to
device volume constraints. For treatment assays, 0.1 TSB was used to control
the PAO1 bioﬁlm yield, which resulted in a similar time course of development
but more consistent fully formed bioﬁlms. Inoculation was performed using the
“outlet” well to prevent contamination of the “inlet” well by pumping in the
reverse direction for a few seconds (see Fig. 1). Following 30 min of incubation
for cell attachment (37°C), fresh medium (0.1 TSB) was pumped (at a ﬂow rate
of 65 l/h, corresponding to 697 m/s) from inlet wells through the channels to
outlet wells. The ﬂow rate was sufﬁcient to prevent back-contamination of the
inlet wells. After bioﬁlms had formed (8 h, 37°C), antibiotics (gentamicin, to-
bramycin, ciproﬂoxacin, or enroﬂoxacin) dissolved in 0.1 TSB at a range of
concentrations were applied overnight (at a ﬂow rate of 65 l/h) in quadrupli-
cate. Treatment with bleach or 70% isopropyl alcohol was used to obtain com-
pletely nonviable bioﬁlms, as some viability remained following treatment with
0.2% bleach, which was not the case with static bioﬁlms (see above).
Two strategies were employed to provide ﬂuorescence for measurement of
viability. One strategy involved the use of GFP-expressing strains and staining
with PI (30 M in 0.85% saline) for 15 min at a ﬂow rate of 93 l/h (997 m/s),
followed by a 20-min rinse with saline. The second strategy involved bacteria not
expressing GFP and viability staining with LIVE/DEAD BacLight stain (Invitro-
gen). The BacLight stain consists of SYTO9 (5 M in 0.85% saline) and PI (30
M in 0.85% saline), which were pumped through the channels (at the same ﬂow
rate and for the same time as described above), which were then rinsed with
saline for 20 min.

Two methods were used to measure ﬂuorescence: plate reader measurement
and quantiﬁcation of ﬂuorescence microscope images. For the ﬁrst method,
BioFlux plates were scanned with a Saﬁre ﬂuorescence plate reader by position-
ing the emission detector beneath the viewing region of each microﬂuidic chan-
nel (see Fig. 1D). To locate this region, a BioFlux plate containing stained
bioﬁlms was scanned at 1,536 positions (using a 48-by-32 grid). Fluorescence
measurements were obtained for two positions along the length of each bioﬁlm
region viewed. The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and emission was deter-
mined for wavelength ranges that matched those used for ﬂuorescence micros-
copy (505 to 525 nm for green; 605 to 625 nm for red) in 5-nm steps. For the
second method, images of BioFlux bioﬁlms were obtained using an inverted
ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE 300), a digital camera (Retiga EX;
Q Imaging), and the Image-Pro Plus 5.0 software. Phase-contrast images were
also collected to verify that all of the cells remained ﬂuorescent. The ﬂuores-
cence intensity of images was quantiﬁed using the NIH freeware ImageJ (http:
//rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html) as described previously (25, 26). Fluorescence
values (obtained using both methods) were integrated and used to calculate the
ratio of green ﬂuorescence to red ﬂuorescence. Intermediate levels of viability
were determined by linearly interpolating between green ﬂuorescence/red ﬂuo-
rescence ratios of 100% viable bioﬁlms (untreated) and 0% viable bioﬁlms
(treated with 70% isopropyl alcohol).
Statistical analyses. GraphPad Prism v. 5.00 was used for all statistical calcu-
lations. The Student t test was used to assess differences between SYTO9-PI data
and GFP-PI data (see Fig. 5). To quantify the correlation between methods (both
for colony counts versus images and for images versus plate reader), the Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient (r) and the associated P value were determined, where r
ranged from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect correlation). We assumed that P
values of 0.05 indicated statistical signiﬁcance. Linear regression analysis was
also performed to compare methods. The coefﬁcient of determination (r2), which
is the fraction of variance that is shared by two methods, is related to correlation
in that r is the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. Due to the heterogeneous nature
of bioﬁlms and considering that the method used was intended for screening
purposes, we considered that r2 values greater than 0.9 indicate a strong corre-
lation.
RESULTS
BioFlux device. High-throughput screening of ﬂow bioﬁlm
viability requires a device that permits development of multi-
ple bioﬁlms with controlled ﬂow rates and determination of
viability in real time. We constructed such a device (Fig. 1A)
with microﬂuidic channels integrated into microtiter well
plates. The use of a standard well plate format (Fig. 1B) al-
lowed compatibility with plate readers and multichannel pipet-
tors, and the plate also could be examined microscopically. The
microﬂuidic channels are generated using photolithography-
etched micropatterned silicon wafers as a mold for polydi-
methylsiloxane, which forms the sides and roofs of the chan-
nels. The bottom of the channels consists of standard 180-m
coverslip glass, which allows microscopic examination. The
channels connect pairs of microtiter wells; one well of each
pair is the inlet well from which fresh medium is pushed by
pneumatic pressure through the channel into the outlet well,
which holds the spent medium (Fig. 1C). The microﬂuidic
channels are 1/10 the size of conventional ﬂow cells, which
permits laminar ﬂow at a wider range of ﬂow rates and results
in uniform bioﬁlm growth in the entire channel. Figure 2 shows
P. ﬂuorescens bioﬁlm formation, which appeared to be quali-
tatively similar to PAO1 bioﬁlm formation; the series of images
was taken 0.5 to 21 h after ﬂow was initiated.
The system includes an air compressor and electropneu-
matic regulators to deliver precisely controlled pressure to
each channel via a manifold that interfaces with individual
wells of the microtiter plate. Thus, the ﬂow (and shear) rate in
each channel can be controlled individually. A thin transparent
heating stage provides temperature control, and a software
interface permits control of the ﬂow rate by the user and saving
and reuse of experimental proﬁles. Unlike conventional ﬂow
cell systems, the BioFlux plates are presterilized and do not
require assembly or tubing connections, which minimizes the
possibility of contamination. The plates each contain 24 chan-
nels connecting 48 wells (Fig. 1B). The BioFlux system controls
four plates simultaneously, providing a total of 96 bioﬁlms.
Each inlet well and outlet well holds 1.25 ml of liquid, so there
can be 11 to 20 h of continuous ﬂow before replenishment is
necessary at commonly used ﬂow rates. The small volume of
the microchannels also results in conservation of reagents.
Quantiﬁcation of viability by measurement of ﬂuorescence.
Flow cell bioﬁlm viability is generally determined using the
LIVE/DEAD BacLight stain combined with imaging of green
ﬂuorescence and red ﬂuorescence, which indicate live and
dead cells, respectively. However, according to recent reports,
this method can overestimate the number of viable cells re-
maining after treatment with low levels of antimicrobial agents,
evidently due to changes in membrane permeability that facil-
itate disproportionate uptake of SYTO9 green (the green “vi-
able” dye) (3, 24). An alternate method to measure viability
by ﬂuorescence is to use green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-
expressing bacteria and the red ﬂuorescent dye propidium
iodide (PI) (24).
To test if this method provides a reliable measure of bioﬁlm
viability, we ﬁrst experimented with static bioﬁlms. These bio-
ﬁlms can be removed, which permits plate counting, and thus
are suitable for comparison to a standard method. Bioﬁlms

were grown in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 h, treated with
bleach at different concentrations (in quadruplicate), and ei-
ther stained with PI or removed for colony counting (Fig. 3).
Emission spectra were collected for stained bioﬁlms (Fig. 3A
and 3B). The ratio of green ﬂuorescence to red ﬂuorescence
was used to estimate bioﬁlm viability, and the results were
compared to the viability of identically treated bioﬁlms deter-
mined by plate counting. The two methods showed that there
were comparable dose-dependent responses to bleach treat-
ment for UPEC (Fig. 3C) and PAO1 (Fig. 3D) bioﬁlms. To
quantify the correlation between methods, we calculated the
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (r) and its associated P value for
viability estimates obtained in three independent experiments
and found that r was 0.9876 and P was 0.0017 for UPEC and
that r was 0.9855 and P was 0.0021 for PAO1. The high cor-
relation coefﬁcients and low P values, together with the results
of linear regression analyses (Fig. 3E and 3F), revealed that
there was a strong correlation between the methods, validating
the GFP-PI method for measuring the viability of two common
bacterial bioﬁlm pathogens.
To determine if the BioFlux device can be used to screen the
effects of antimicrobial agents on ﬂow bioﬁlms, we cultivated
GFP-expressing PAO1 bioﬁlms in this device. The bioﬁlms
were treated with bleach or antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramy-
cin, ciproﬂoxacin, or enroﬂoxacin) and then stained with PI,
which was followed by measurement of ﬂuorescence with a
plate reader. Both the bleach and the antibiotics caused dose-
dependent bioﬁlm killing, as determined by ﬂuorescence mea-
sured with the plate reader (Fig. 4). Bleach was less effective
for ﬂow bioﬁlms than it was for static bioﬁlms (86% viability

versus 50% viability for 0.05% bleach, 56% viability versus
17% viability for 0.02% bleach, and 6% viability versus 0%
viability for 0.2% bleach), and 70% isopropanol was required
to completely kill the bioﬁlms. Whether this was due to greater
resistance is unclear because in addition to the presence of
ﬂow, there are other differences between bioﬁlms grown in
96-well plates and BioFlux bioﬁlms. The quinolones had the
most potent effect; ciproﬂoxacin and enroﬂoxacin caused com-
plete loss of viability at concentrations of 1 and 10 g/ml,
respectively (Fig. 4D and 4E). As a further check of the reli-
ability of rapid plate reader scanning for determination of
viability, we analyzed bioﬁlm images obtained by ﬂuorescence
microscopy (Fig. 4, insets), as reported previously (25, 26). The
bioﬁlm viability calculated from ﬂuorescence ratios obtained
using microscope images agreed with that measured with the
plate reader (Fig. 4); the correlation coefﬁcient (r  0.9565;
P  0.0001) and linear regression analysis (Fig. 4F) veriﬁed
that there was a strong correlation between the results of the
two methods. The ﬂuorescent microscope images conﬁrmed
that the quinolones completely eradicated the bioﬁlms (cipro-
ﬂoxacin at a concentration of 1 g/ml and enroﬂoxacin at a
concentration of 10 g/ml), as indicated by the complete ab-
sence of ﬂuorescence (Fig. 4D and 4E, insets).
We used the GFP-PI method because Lehtinen et al. (24)
showed that it was superior to the BacLight method for mea-
suring the effects of low concentrations of antimicrobial agents
on the viability of planktonic bacteria. The limitation of the
BacLight method at low concentrations of antimicrobials is

bleach (A) or various antibiotics (B to E) and then stained with PI. Levels of viability were calculated by using the green ﬂuorescence/red
ﬂuorescence ratios determined from quantiﬁed microscope images (black bars) and by using plate reader measurements (white bars). Isopropyl
alcohol (70%) was used to ensure complete loss of viability. Insets show representative microscope images, including images of untreated (0) and
isopropyl-alcohol treated (isop.) controls. Note that no bioﬁlm remained after treatment with the highest dose of enroﬂoxacin (E) and the two
highest doses of ciproﬂoxacin (D). Fluorescence signals were not detected (N.D.) with the plate reader, and no bioﬁlms were observed using
microscopy (insets). (F) Linear regression analysis for determinations of viability by the two methods.

apparently due to increased penetration of SYTO9 but not PI,
which falsely increases the green ﬂuorescence/red ﬂuorescence
ratio used to determine viability (3, 24). We assumed that this
limitation was applicable to bacterial bioﬁlms. The success of
the BioFlux device for HTP screening of ﬂow bioﬁlm viability,
as reported above, enabled us to test this assumption directly.
We cultivated PAO1 bioﬁlms not expressing GFP in the
BioFlux apparatus, treated them with gentamicin, stained them
with the two BacLight stains (SYTO9 and PI), and used the
ratio of green ﬂuorescence to red ﬂuorescence to calculate the
viability. Compared to the GFP-PI ﬂuorescence results, treat-
ment with SYTO9 resulted in much higher levels of green
ﬂuorescence for the two low concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 g/
ml), resulting in a false increase in viability (e.g., viability
greater than 100% compared to untreated controls). However,
at higher concentrations of the antibiotic the two methods gave
comparable results (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with
tobramycin, enroﬂoxacin, and ciproﬂoxacin; for example, with
0.01 g/ml of each antibiotic, the levels of viability determined
by the BacLight light method were 166%, 117%, and 70% of
the untreated control values, respectively, while the levels of
viability determined by the GFP-PI method were 77%, 44%,
and 47% of the untreated control values, respectively (Fig. 4).
Thus, the BacLight method gives an erroneous picture of via-
bility after exposure to low antimicrobial agent concentrations
not only for planktonic cells but also for bioﬁlms.
DISCUSSION
Flow bioﬁlms are commonly cultivated in ﬂow cells, and
their viability is determined by quantiﬁcation of microscopic
ﬂuorescent images or by colony counting, both of which are
time-consuming; colony counting is particularly difﬁcult be-
cause ﬂow bioﬁlms cannot be easily removed from the ﬂow
cells. HTP screening of viability by this method is not feasible
not only because of these constraints but also because it would
require the use of a prohibitively large number of ﬂow cells.
We used a microﬂuidic device, the BioFlux device, which ac-
curately controls ﬂuid ﬂow and permits simultaneous growth of
multiple bioﬁlms with a large range of precisely controlled ﬂow
rates. Here we describe a method for rapidly determining
bioﬁlm viability simply by measuring ﬂuorescence with a plate
reader, eliminating the need for the labor-intensive analyses
mentioned above. The results show that measurement of
GFP-PI ﬂuorescence with a plate reader reliably reﬂects bio-
ﬁlm viability as veriﬁed by plate counting (Fig. 3), as well as
viability determined by quantiﬁcation of ﬂuorescence micro-
scope images (Fig. 4). Thus, the BioFlux device used in con-
junction with the GFP-PI viability assessment method is an
excellent method for initial HTP screening of ﬂow bioﬁlms;
this was veriﬁed by successful use of this method for HTP
screening of PAO1 bioﬁlms for sensitivity to a number of
antimicrobials.
The plate reader-based BioFlux viability screening method
relied on the use of bacterial strains expressing GFP; for non-
GFP-expressing bacteria another method, such as LIVE/
DEAD BacLight staining, must be used. However, the Ba-
cLight viability method, as reported previously for planktonic
cells (3, 24) and conﬁrmed here for bioﬁlms, is limited to
treatments causing a relatively higher level of killing. This
ﬁnding appears to limit use of the BioFlux to bacteria capable
of expressing GFP. However, there are other possibilities. For
example, the LIVE/DEAD stain is accurate for determination
of viability where the level of killing is high, which is often the
goal of HTP screening; another possibility is to use a ﬂuoro-
genic substrate, such as 4-methylumbellyferyl--D-glucuronide
(28), to measure bioﬁlm metabolic activity. The BioFlux device
is also likely to be useful in HTP screening of other bioﬁlm
parameters. One example is investigating expression of a ﬂuo-
rescently tagged protein under different conditions, such as
ﬂuid shear. Another example is determination of the formation
or elimination of the extracellular matrix, which can be done by
using poly-N-acetylglucosamine-binding wheat germ aggluti-
nin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (5).

FIG. 5. Viability of PAO1 BioFlux bioﬁlms determined using
SYTO9-PI and GFP-PI. Treatment with low levels (0.01 and 0.1 g/
ml) of gentamicin increased SYTO9 uptake and green ﬂuorescence,
resulting in enhancement of false-positive viability (100%), which did
not occur with GFP-PI ﬂuorescence. The Student t test P value is
shown for each concentration of gentamicin; a P value of 0.05 indi-
cates that there is a statistically signiﬁcant difference.
