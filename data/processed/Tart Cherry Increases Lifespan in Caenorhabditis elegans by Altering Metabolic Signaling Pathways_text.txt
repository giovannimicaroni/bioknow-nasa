Abstract:
Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors.
The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis
elegans and mammals. Speciﬁcally, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO
transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial
dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of
tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual beneﬁts
for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneﬁcial eﬀects on aging in C. elegans.
We found that TCE supplementation at 6 µg or 12 µg/mL, increased (p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of
wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these
ﬁndings, TCE upregulated (p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2
(but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2. Further, we showed
that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change
the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our ﬁndings indicate that TCE
confers healthspan beneﬁts in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced
oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway.

1. Introduction
Aging has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on economy, health, and demography with healthy aging being
a global challenge [1]. In 2018, ~16% of the United States population were 65 years old or over and
expected to reach 23% by 2060 [2]. Globally, 9% of the population was old (over age 65) in 2019, which is
expected to increase to 16% by 2050 [3]. Genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to aging and healthy
lifespan. The eﬀects of aging could be altered, and progression of aging could be slowed down [4].
Various factors contribute to aging such as defects in development and genetics, environmental
factors, diseases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause harmful changes in cells and
tissues [5]. Excessive ROS production causes oxidative stress, which is a predominant factor in the
pathophysiology of various diseases and aging in human and other models [6] such as Caenorhabditis
elegans (C. elegans) [7] and Drosophila [8]. Calorie restriction is the most established method for
successfully extending lifespan of animals and model organisms such as C. elegans [9–11]. However,
human studies are scarce [12], and the safety and eﬀectiveness of calorie restriction for lifespan

extension in humans is controversial [1]. Therefore, it is critical to identify dietary bioactive compounds
that reduce ROS levels and thereby delay aging.
Among the pathways and genes involved in lifespan regulation, DAF-16 is homologous to
mammalian forkhead box O1 (FOXO) transcription factor, and a key lifespan extension transcription
factor that is highly conserved across a variety of organisms such as ﬂies, worms, rodents,
and humans [12,13]. C. elegans DAF-2 signaling, which is orthologous to insulin and insulin like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1) in mammals, is also involved in metabolism and longevity but is negatively regulated
by DAF-16/FOXO signaling [14]. Additionally, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
a conserved energy sensor in cells, extends lifespan of C. elegans [15]. In addition to these major
pathways and genes, ROS is also involved in regulating longevity [16]. High ROS activity has been
shown to be a major lifespan limiting factor in humans, C. elegans, and Drosophila [7,17–19]. Finally,
in addition to the factors discussed above, mitochondria regulate diﬀerent signaling and metabolic
pathways, including ROS production and therefore plays a vital role in aging progression [20].
Dietary intervention is one of the eﬀective non-genetic or pharmacological means to combat
aging [21]. Botanicals like cranberry, strawberry, blueberry, sweet cherry, tart cherry, and curcumin
all contain biologically active polyphenols, which may protect against diseases and promote
health in animals, humans, and model organisms [22–24].
Moreover, cranberry [8,13,25],
mulberry [26], and blueberry anthocyanins increase lifespan of C. elegans and Drosophila via diﬀerent
pathways [17,27,28]. Out of these, Montmorency tart cherry (Prunus cerasus) contains high concentration
of anthocyanin ﬂavonoids, and its consumption is known to provide numerous health beneﬁts by
reducing inﬂammation and production of ROS [29,30] as well as protecting against diabetes [31],
cardiovascular diseases [32], muscle pain [33], and cancer [34].
Tart cherry (TC) possess increased antioxidant activity both in vivo and in vitro [35]. However,
the mechanisms by which TC reverses eﬀects of aging through antioxidant activities have not been
studied yet and remain to be further elucidated. To investigate the eﬀects of TC extract (TCE) on aging
and healthspan, we used the nematode C. elegans, which is an excellent model for aging research [36]
because of its short lifespan (2–3 weeks), experimental ﬂexibility, and rapid turnover [37]. Furthermore,
C. elegans behavior and physiological activities slow down with age similar to that of higher mammals,
including humans [27]. Additionally, 83% of C. elegans proteome shows homology to the human
proteome, and both humans and nematodes share signiﬁcant age-related characteristics that can be
used to study eﬀects on health and aging [21,38].
In this paper, we determined mechanisms by which TCE extends lifespan in C. elegans using
microﬂuidic devices for whole-life culture studies that allow eﬃcient drug delivery compared to
animals reared on agar-plates [39–41]. We demonstrated that TCE extends lifespan and healthspan
of C. elegans by inﬂuencing the major DAF-16/FOXO lifespan regulating pathway. Consistent with
this ﬁnding, TCE regulated upstream and downstream genes related to DAF-16 pathway, reduced
the activity of genes related to ROS, and increased oxygen consumption rate. Therefore, our ﬁndings
reveal protective anti-aging eﬀects of TCE in vivo with robust translational potential in humans due to
the feasibility of incorporating TCE into a typical human diet.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Preparation of Tart Cherry (TC) Extract
Frozen TC (Cherry Marketing Institute, Dewitt, MI, USA) was ground using motor and pestle to
obtain TC extract (TCE). Extracted cherry juice was ﬁltered using 0.22 µm ﬁlter and stored in −80 ◦C
until further use. Amounts of TCE used are based on anthocyanin concentration. We used TCE with
doses between 0–12 µg anthocyanin per mL media. TCE extract from frozen TC contains 533 ± 47 µg/g
total anthocyanin [29], and 1 µL TCE contains 3 µg of anthocyanins as measured by high performance
liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (HPLC-MS) [35,42,43]. Additionally, TCE contains other
phenolics, melatonin, vitamins A/C/E/K, niacin, beta carotene, lutein + zeaxanthin, and pantothenic

acid [29,44]. To prevent oxidation, thermal degradation, chemical and biochemical changes, extracted
TC was aliquoted (20 µL) and stored in −80 ◦C [45]. Aliquots of TCE were thawed only once and not
refrozen, and TCE was replaced every day to prevent oxidation [45].
2.2. Strains and Growth Conditions
Worms (wild type N2, daf-16, aak-2) (Vanapalli lab, TTU, Lubbock, TX, USA) were maintained on
solid nematode growth medium for two successive generations, as previously described [46]. On the
third day, age-synchronized young adults were used for analyses.
2.3. Lifespan Assay
At day 3, individual worms were suspended in liquid buﬀer (Nematode Growth Media (NGM))
and loaded into the micropillar chambers of a NemaLife microﬂuidic device using a syringe [40,41].
Each microﬂuidic device contained 30 individual chambers for animals to crawl, and one worm was
loaded per chamber. Chambers were washed everyday with NGM to avoid progenies. Adult worms
were fed with concentrated bacteria (100 mg/mL OP50) mixed with 3, 6, and 12 µg/mL TCE in the ﬁnal
mixture every day starting at day three until they all died. Chambers were rinsed everyday using
liquid NGM media to wash out worm progenies and food was replenished. Worms were scored for
survival every day. Worms killed during manipulation, wash errors, and bagging of worms exposed
to contamination events were subsequently censored from analyses. At least three independent trials
were performed for all conditions. Lifespan analyses were carried out using Kaplan–Meier statistical
function using GraphPad Prism Version 7.04 software, with statistical signiﬁcance considered at p < 0.05
using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.
2.4. Gene Expression Analyses
Age synchronized worms ~500 µL was added into 60 mm plates. We estimated that each plate
had approximately same number of worms ~1000 for RNA isolation. These N2 worms were grown in
3 mL of liquid axenic media for 7 days and then treated with or without tart cherry (6 µg/mL media,
12 µg/mL media) for 3 days, after which RNA was isolated using RNA isolation kit (Zymo Research
Corp, Irvine, CA, USA) following manufacturers protocol. Same amount of total RNA was transcribed
into cDNA using Maxima Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, CA, USA). Maxima
powerup SYBRTM Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, CA, USA) was used for making cDNA
to test targeted genes including daf-16, daf-2, daf-18, aak-2, akt-1, lin-14, skn-1, ucp-4, sod-2/3 with 18s
housekeeping gene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
2.5. Mitochondrial Respiration Analysis
To investigate TC-mediated changes in mitochondrial function, oxygen consumption rate (OCR)
measurements were performed using the Seahorse XFe24 analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Three days treated adult wild-type worms were washed twice in M9 buﬀer [47] and transferred into
M9-ﬁlled wells (20 worms/well) in replicates of 4 per condition (i.e., 4 wells per strain). The experiment
was repeated three times (n = 3) using the same conditions. To generate stable OCR measurements,
5 measurement cycles were performed for basal OCR, 9 cycles for maximal OCR following the addition
of FCCP (10 µM ﬁnal well concentration), and 5 cycles for non-mitochondrial OCR following the
addition of sodium azide (40 mM ﬁnal well concentration). OCR measurements were normalized to the
number of worms per well. To avoid unstable OCR measurements, the ﬁnal 3, 7, and 2 measurement
cycles were used for the statistical analysis of basal, maximal, and non-mitochondrial OCR, respectively.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
Diﬀerences in gene expression and OCR were detected with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism 7.04, with statistical signiﬁcance considered at p < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Tart Cherry Extends Mean Lifespan of Wild Type N2 C. elegans in a Dose-Dependent Manner
Under these conditions, wild type (WT) worms had a mean lifespan (MLS) of 13.31 ± 0.61 days.
The MLS of worms treated with TCE at concentrations of 3, 6, and 12 µg/mL were 14.92 ± 0.58,
16.83 ± 0.77, and 16.73 ± 0.67 days, respectively. While there was no diﬀerence with 3 µg/mL, both 6 and
12 µg/mL TCE signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) increased lifespan by 26.44% and 25.69%, respectively (Figure 1
and Supplementary Table S1), compared to no TCE treatment.

(pink) and 12 µg/mL (purple) TCE increased mean lifespan (MLS) in wild type (N2) C. elegans (p < 0.05)
by 16.83 ± 0.77 and 16.73 ± 0.67 days, respectively compared to control or no treatment (0 µg/mL,
MLS 13.31 ± 0.61 days, black) or 3 µg/mL TCE (blue, MLS: 14.92 ± 0.58 days) grown at 20 ◦C. Each
lifespan experiment was repeated at least three independent times with similar results.
3.2. Tart Cherry Eﬀects on Genes Related to Aging
To identify molecular mechanism(s) involved in promoting lifespan by TCE, we selected 6 and
12 µg/mL TCE that extended mean lifespan of WT worms in data discussed above. Using qRT-PCR,
we evaluated the mRNA levels of daf-2, age-1 ortholog of human phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
3-kinase, and daf-16 genes in WT worms treated with 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE. Both 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE
decreased mRNA expression of daf-2 (Figure 2a) and increased mRNA expression of daf-16 (Figure 2b).
However, age-1 gene, downstream target of insulin/insulin like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS),
had very low expression (data not shown due to low expression levels).
Moreover, we measured the mRNA levels of daf-18 gene (Figure 2c), a human phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene ortholog, which downregulates DAF-2 receptor
pathway by inhibiting the activity of AGE-1 [48]. Here, we observed that daf-18 was upregulated
signiﬁcantly by 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE, which may also be involved in down regulating IIS signaling
and promoting DAF-16 nuclear localization [49]. Additionally, we measured two upstream DAF-16
inhibitors, serine-threonine protein kinase (akt-1) (Figure 2d) and lin-14 (Figure 2e) and did not ﬁnd any
changes in expression levels of these genes following TCE treatment. This suggests that upregulation
of upstream daf-18 gene may inhibit the expression of akt-1 and lin-14.
As antioxidant status and mitochondrial function are also important in aging, we measured the
mRNA levels of markers involved in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. Speciﬁcally, we measured
levels of (i) SKiNhead (SKN-1), homolog to mammalian nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
2 (NRF-2); (ii) uncoupling protein-4 (UCP-4), mitochondrial uncoupling protein; (iii) SOD-2/3,
a superoxide dismutase controlling ROS production; and (iv) aak-2, an AMP-activated protein
kinase homolog known to directly regulate daf-16 activity. Data in Figure 2 illustrate changes in
expression of these genes following TCE treatment as shown by mRNA levels of skn-1 (Figure 2f), ucp-4
(Figure 2g), sod-2 (Figure 2h), and aak-2 (Figure 2j), all of which were signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) in
the worms treated with 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE, compared to worms with no TCE treatments. By contrast,

Nutrients 2020, 12, 1482

no diﬀerences were observed in mRNA levels for sod-3 (Figure 2i) with TCE treatment at either dose
tested. Collectively, our results indicate that TCE acts through the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS)
pathways by directly or indirectly inﬂuencing the activities of the DAF-16 transcription factor.

levels of akt, lin-14 and sod-3 in the 6 and 12 µg/mL treated worms compared to not treated worms
(0 µg/mL). Synchronized worms (approx. n ~ 1000) grown in the axenic media were treated with 0, 6,

3.3. Eﬀects of TCE on C. elegans Respiration
As few mitochondrial genes are changed by TCE, we next assessed changes in mitochondrial
function/respiration by TCE in C. elegans, using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux analyzer, (Figure 3).
Only spare respiration, which reﬂects “the ability of an organism to respond to increasing energy
demands” [50] was signiﬁcantly higher in 6 and 12 µg/mL treated worms compared to non-treated
(0 µg/mL) and 3 µg/mL TCE treated worms (Figure 3a). There were no diﬀerences observed in
maximum (Figure 3b), mitochondrial (Figure 3c), or non-mitochondrial (Figure 3d) respiration.

compared to non-treated worms.
3.4. TCE Did Not Extend Mean Lifespan in Daf-16 and Aak-2 Mutant Worms
Because daf-16 mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly increased by TCE, we tested whether daf-16
mutant worms were responsive to the same concentration of TCE used for WT worms to further validate
the speciﬁc pathways involved in TCE-mediated lifespan extension. None of the TCE concentrations
used (3, 6, and 12 µg/mL) signiﬁcantly changed the MLS of daf-16 mutant worms (Figure 4a and
Supplementary Table S2), which support our initial ﬁnding that lifespan extension by TCE is dependent
on IIS/DAF-16 pathway.
Moreover, since TCE signiﬁcantly increased mRNA expression of aak-2 in WT worms,
and published research showed that both DAF-16 and AAK-2 are involved in regulating longevity [51],
we next tested involvement of AAK-2 signaling in lifespan. Interestingly, TCE (3, 6, and 12 µg/mL)
did not increase the MLS of aak-2 mutant worms (Figure 4b and Supplementary Table S3), indicating
importance of this pathway in TCE mediated longevity eﬀects.

three independent times with similar results. Statistical signiﬁcance considered at p < 0.05 using the
log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.
4. Discussion
Studies have observed that bioactive compounds from various botanicals oﬀer a variety of health
beneﬁts against obesity, cancer, inﬂammation, and age-related functional decline [23,35,52,53]. Here,
we showed that Montmorency Tart Cherry is a potentially eﬀective nutraceutical for promoting healthy
aging in C. elegans. We showed that TCE consumption substantially extends lifespan mainly through
IIS and DAF-16 signaling. We further conﬁrmed these ﬁndings in mutant worms lacking functional
daf-16 and aak-2 genes. TCE treatment did not extend the lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms.
4.1. TCE Increases Lifespan through IIS and DAF-16 Pathway
In this study we used 3, 6, and 12 µg/mL of TCE to investigate its longevity eﬀects in C. elegans.
Previous studies from our lab have shown that TC increased cell survival and antioxidant activity
in vitro using adipocytes [35]. Moreover, TC reduced toxic levels of ROS in both adipocytes and Zucker
fatty rats [35]. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have documented lifespan eﬀects of TCE
in mammalian and only one study has showed TCE eﬀects in model organisms [54]. Some studies
have shown that TC improves memory, autophagy, and hippocampal inﬂammation in aged rats [52]
and protects against age-related bone loss in mice [55]. Studies in C. elegans with blueberries (50,
100, and 200 mg/mL of extract) demonstrated increased MLS by 22.2%, 36.5%, and 44.4% [27] and
5 mg/mL of blueberry extracts extended MLS of Drosophila by 10% [17]. Similarly, cranberry extracts
(2 mg/mL) increased MLS of C. elegans by 32.5% [13] and 20 mg/mL cranberry extracts extended
MLS of Drosophila by 10% [8]; purple wheat anthocyanins (100 µg/mL) increased MLS of C. elegans
by 10.5% [56]. In our study, we found that feeding C. elegans lower concentrations of TCE (3, 6,
and 12 µg/mL) resulted in signiﬁcant extension of MLS by 12.09% (p > 0.05), 26.44% (p < 0.05),

Nutrients 2020, 12, 1482
8 of 15
and 25.69% (p < 0.05), respectively. These results are comparable to ﬁndings from the studies outlined
above using other plant or fruit extracts [13,27,56]. However, previous studies in C. elegans were done
on agar plates, which require typically very high doses to get enough drug into the worms, as the drug
can diﬀuse into the agar, and drug delivery is not eﬃcient. Our cultures are in liquid environment due
to microﬂuidics (NemaLife), which is a novel approach to culture worms with several advantages:
worms can crawl in an optimized micropillar arena in liquid (unlike in agar plates) that improves drug
delivery; during maintenance, sieve channels dispersed progeny, thus avoiding loss of adults; they can
feed the adult-only population [41]. Consistent with the advantages mentioned above, observation of
lifespan-extension with low doses of TCE suggests that the microﬂuidic environments are eﬃcient at
drug delivery compared to agar plates.
IIS pathway modulates aging and longevity and highly conserved in invertebrates and mammals.
Insulin like peptide (ILPs), an insulin/IGF-1 receptor (DAF-2), serine/threonine kinase (pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK-1), AKT-1/2, AGE-1)/PI3K and FOXO transcription factor
(DAF-16) are major components of the IIS transduction cascades [49].
Inactivation of DAF-16
transcription factor occurs after binding of ILPs to DAF-2, inhibiting the nuclear translocation of
DAF-16 [57], which negatively regulates longevity.
In addition to IIS signaling, many signaling pathways such as TOR, AMPK, Ca2+/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways are involved
in aging [49,58].
Inhibition of TOR signaling increases lifespan of C. elegans and Drosophila via
DAF-16 [8,59], CaMKII targets DAF-16 and modulates lifespan when worms are exposed to heat,
hunger, or some other form of stressors [58], and JNK-1 signaling also regulates the activity of DAF-16
to promote lifespan post transcriptionally [60].
Very limited studies have tested eﬀects of bioactive compounds in worms. Supplementation with
wild blueberry juice (50, 100, and 200 mg/mL) increased C. elegans lifespan through CaMKII pathway
that mediates osmotic stress resistance [28]. Other studies using fresh blueberry (200 µg/mL) also
showed increased lifespan and stress tolerance through DAF-16 [27], cranberry extract (2 mg/mL) [25]
and anthocyanin-rich purple wheat extract (100 µg/mL) [56] increased lifespan in C. elegans via the
IIS/DAF-16 signaling pathway [13,25,56]. Further studies showed that oleanolic acid increased lifespan
and stress tolerance through DAF-16 [61] while resveratrol, found in grape berry skin (100 µM),
increased lifespan in C. elegans through sirtuin 2.1 (SIR 2.1), mammalian NAD-dependent protein
deacetylase homology [62]. Moreover, blackberry extract increased antioxidant capacity in worms and
provided protection against ROS generation [63]. In addition, a recently published study revealed that
TCE acts as a calorie restriction mimetic and increased lifespan in C. elegans [54].
Our ﬁndings showed that TCE regulates many components in IIS pathway to inﬂuence lifespan.
TCE did not increase lifespan in daf-16 mutant C. elegans, indicating that TCE may regulate lifespan
through DAF-16. Further analysis of genes in WT worms also conﬁrmed that TCE regulates lifespan
mainly via DAF-16/IIS pathway, evident by signiﬁcantly reduced expression of daf-2 and increased
expression of daf-16 genes. Since both DAF-2 and DAF-16 in IIS pathway are highly conserved,
our ﬁndings reveal the signiﬁcant potential of TCE to promote healthy aging in humans. Although we
did not see any changes of akt-1 and lin-14, two inhibitors of DAF-16, at mRNA levels, there are many
other upstream pathways and downstream targets that we did not test. Thus, it is possible that TCE
regulates upstream molecular targets of akt and lin-14, which merit further investigation, including
those that control the expression of these genes such as pdk-1 and lin-4. SKN-1 is another transcription
factor, which acts downstream of IIS pathway and showed reduced expression with reduced IIS
signaling [64]. We found that skn-1 gene expression was also upregulated by TCE treatments in WT
worms. Our results are consistent with a recently published study using Hibiscus sabdariﬀa L. extracts
which increased SKN-1 activity and prolonged lifespan in C. elegans [65]. Studies have shown that
cherries including sour cherry possess antimicrobial activity [66]. We performed all our gene expression
data in liquid CMEM media without bacteria supplementation and still observed increased expression
of lifespan-related genes. However, in our current study, we did not measure anti-microbial activity of

Nutrients 2020, 12, 1482

TCE on the OP50 bacteria which might account for part of calorie restriction-like eﬀects on C. elegans to
increase lifespan. Therefore, these ﬁndings must be validated in future in lifespan assays.
4.2. Involvement of AMPK/AAK-2 in Lifespan Determination
Interestingly, TCE did not increase the MLS of aak-2 mutant worms, indicating importance of this
pathway in TCE-mediated longevity eﬀects. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fuel-sensing
enzyme that negatively regulates fatty acid synthesis and positively regulates energy production
pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation [57]. Activation of AAK-2, homolog of AMPK in
C. elegans physiologically (dietary restriction) or pharmacologically (resveratrol or metformin), increased
lifespan of C. elegans [67]. C. elegans has both aak-1 and aak-2, two diﬀerent genes. The AMPKα1 subunit
in C. elegans, AAK-2, is activated by AMP and involved in longevity [51]. By contrast, AMPKα2
subunit, AAK-2, in C. elegans is not involved in longevity eﬀects suggesting that AAK-2 is the subunit
with kinase activity [67]. Because of that, here, we evaluated the eﬀects of TCE in aak-2 worm lifespan
and aak-2 gene expression in WT worms. TCE did not change the MLS of aak-2 worms treated with
TCE. Previous studies reported that aak-2 (ok524) mutants have a shorter lifespan (12%) than WT
worms [51]. In contrast to these ﬁndings, however, aak-2 (rb754) mutant worms we used for our
lifespan assays did not show shorter average lifespan than WT worms, and aak-2 (rb754) had 17.8%
increased lifespan than WT worms. The above reported study has been conducted on agar plates,
while we used microﬂuidic devices for the lifespan assay and fed worms everyday with liquid OP50
mixed with TCE. Changes of the environment, use of microﬂuidic devices, and diﬀerences in the aak-2
strains used might be a potential cause for these discrepancies. Further genetic analysis in WT worms
showed increased expression of aak-2 gene with TCE treatments. Possibly, activation of aak-2 increased
fatty acid oxidation in WT worms, which may change total fatty acid composition in the worms and
indirectly inﬂuence the lifespan of WT worms. However, these changes were not taking place in
mutant aak2, which may aﬀect their responses to TCE and changes in fatty acid composition or lipid
metabolism. These ﬁndings suggest that TCE acts partly through AAK-2 pathway and requires DAF-16
and IIS pathways to increase lifespan in C. elegans. Sirtuins-1 (Sirt-1), an ortholog of mammalian yeast
deacetylase Sir-2 linked to IIS signaling pathway [12], may also be involved in lifespan regulation and
merits further investigation.
4.3. Role of Mitochondria in Lifespan Determination
Mitochondria plays an important role in overall cellular and organism health. Mitochondria
are involved in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, and production of ROS [60].
It is thought that
impaired mitochondria produce more ROS which causes cellular damage and leads to aging [68,69].
SOD is an enzyme that is involved in detoxiﬁcation [16,70] and is found in cytoplasm, nucleus,
and mitochondria [71]. Experiments in yeast and mice showed that knocking out sod-1 and sod-2
decreased lifespan [72,73]. In contrast, another study reported that SOD has no eﬀect on lifespan in
C. elegans [16]. In our current study, sod-2 gene levels were increased with TCE, with no changes in sod-3
gene expression. Another study using purple pitanga fruit showed increased sod-3 protein expression
in C. elegans [19]. We chose sod-3 over sod-1 as they share some genetic similarities and have a certain
level of amino acid homology, and sod-2 does not share substantial amino acid homology with either
sod-1 or sod-3 [74]. Possibly, increased sod-2 gene expression in our study decreased mitochondrial ROS
activity and extended lifespan. However, these ﬁndings remain to be conﬁrmed using sod-2 mutant
worms. Furthermore, to validate eﬀects of TCE on ROS production, we plan in future to conduct
additional functional assays to measure ROS, GSH/SG, and MDA levels.
Ideal mitochondrial function is critical to have healthy cellular activity, and mitochondrial
respiration is a strong indicator of good mitochondrial function [75]. An age-related decline in
oxidative phosphorylation can relate to reduced mitochondrial and nuclear expressed peptides
functioning in the electron transport chain (ETC) [76]. Mitochondrial health can be measured by the
rate of mitochondrial respiration in ETC [77,78]. Moreover, alterations in the oxygen consumption

Nutrients 2020, 12, 1482
10 of 15
rate are an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction [79]. Moreover, decreased mitochondrial function
reduces suﬃcient energy production, which plays key role during aging [80]. In order to quantify
the function of mitochondria, we assessed mitochondrial OCR by TCE treatments in WT C. elegans.
Our data showed that TCE treated adult worms have signiﬁcantly higher spare respiration capacity
with 6 and 12 µg/mL concentrations. Spare respiratory capacity is the amount of additional ATP
produced by oxidative phosphorylation as a result of sudden increase in energy demand [76]. Based on
our ﬁndings, it is possible that increased expression of antioxidant genes, led to increased mitochondrial
spare respiration by reducing ROS production and oxidative stress in part through sod-2.
Another indicator of mitochondrial function is uncoupling proteins (UCPs). C. elegans expresses
ucp-4. UCPs are highly conserved in many species, such as invertebrates, plants, and mammals.
UCP-1 in mammals is induced by cold temperature and is a major player in thermogenesis and energy
expenditure [81]. Mammals express several other UCPs, which are involved in diﬀerent functions
other than thermogenesis. It is reported that non-thermogenic UCPs protect cells against oxidative
stress [82]. In support of these ideas, knocking down ucp-2 gene in mice generated more ROS than
WT mice [83], and knocking down ucp-3 gene led to more ROS production in skeletal muscle [84].
UCP-like protein in C. elegans is thoroughly related to ucp-4 in mammals, and the two proteins share
46% sequence identity [85]. Here, we found that expression of ucp-4 was signiﬁcantly higher in worms
treated with 6 and 12 µg/mL TCE. Several studies documented that ucp-4 mutants may be involved
in increased neuronal defects during aging [68,86], but none of the studies have reported lifespan
extension eﬀects of ucp-4 by reducing mitochondrial ROS production. Our ﬁndings suggest that
reduced ROS production and increased mitochondrial function by TCE may be governed partially by
increased ucp-4 expression.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that TCE increases lifespan of C. elegans, in a DAF-16-dependent
manner. This may be mainly due to genetic regulation in IIS and DAF-16 pathway, partial involvement
of AAK-2 signaling, increased antioxidant activity, and spare respiratory activity, allowing cells to
function better under stressful conditions. Major underlying molecular targets are summarized in
Figure 5, some of which require additional validations. Further studies are warranted to understand
mechanisms linking oxidative stress, respiration, and longevity and their regulation by dietary
antioxidants such as tart cherry anthocyanins.
Figure 5. Major molecular targets for TCE in C. elegans. TCE downregulated daf-2 gene and up-regulated
daf-16, daf-18, skn-1, sod-2, ucp-4, and aak-2 while no changes were observed in akt-1 or lin-14 genes.
These molecules may be indirectly involved in regulating mitochondrial function, oxidative stress,
ant-oxidant activity, and fatty acid metabolism, and this may subsequently increase lifespan of C. elegans.
Downregulated genes are shown in red; up-regulated genes are shown in blue, and those genes that
were not changed by TCE are shown in green. Dotted arrows show potential indirect targets of TCE.
