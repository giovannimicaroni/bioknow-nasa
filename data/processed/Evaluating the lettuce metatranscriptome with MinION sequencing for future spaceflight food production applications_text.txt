Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production,
and psychological beneﬁts. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and
production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red
romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts
enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show
that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial
transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a
potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and
maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.

INTRODUCTION
As humanity strives to prepare for the upcoming manned
missions to the Moon and cis-lunar orbit, it has become evident
that growing plants for food and other life support systems is
essential to humankind’s space exploration agenda1–4. To ensure
that these future missions are successful, it is necessary to
investigate all aspects of the basic physiological and molecular
responses of food crops and their microbiomes to the spaceﬂight
environment, so that any issues faced on these missions can be
efﬁciently managed and mitigated on-orbit.
Plants have complex and dynamic relationships with their
microorganisms, which are inﬂuenced by various stresses and
environmental factors, including spaceﬂight5–9. The novel envir-
onments of spaceﬂight and microgravity analogs have been
shown to alter the plant–microbe interactions at both the genetic
and
physiological
levels,
oftentimes
resulting
in
increased
susceptibility to diseases10–14. For example, soybean seedlings
grown in spaceﬂight are more susceptible to the colonization of
fungal pathogen, Phytophthora sojae, when compared to ground
controls10. In addition, simulated microgravity experiments have
demonstrated that clinorotation reduces the growth and devel-
opment of the legume Medicargo truncatula and signiﬁcantly
affects its symbiotic relationship with the rhizobium Sinorhizobium
meliloti and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Rhizophagus irregularis15.
Speciﬁcally, nodule size and number were reduced under
clinorotation when compared to static controls15. Moreover, in
another simulated microgravity experiment performed on random
positioning machines, the endophytic bacterial diversity in wheat
(Triticum aestivum) seedlings behaves differently under simulated
microgravity
when
compared
to
normal
gravity
controls14.
Speciﬁcally, some bacterial genera (e.g., Pseudomonas, Paeniba-
cillus, and Bacillus) that can produce plant growth-promoting and
antimicrobial substances, exhibit clear differences in relative
abundance between microgravity and Earth gravity treatments14.
However, research on how microgravity impacts plant–microbe
interactions is still in its infancy. It is, therefore, critical to develop
efﬁcient methods for investigating plant–microbe interactions to
expand our current knowledge base for future space exploration.
The dynamic nature of plant–microbial interactions requires
regular monitoring of a crop’s microbiome and its metabolic
activities to assess plant health. These measures together with
other surveillance techniques (e.g., hyperspectral imaging) will
ensure that successful cultivation of crops on long-duration
missions in space can be accomplished.
To date, plants have been successfully grown in space in
multiple hardware systems, such as the Vegetable Production
System (Veggie), Advanced Plant Habitat, and the LADA green-
house16. For example, edible leafy crops have been safely
produced in the Veggie hardware on the International Space
Station (ISS) and consumed by crew members17. There have been,
however, sporadic instances of contamination with opportunistic
fungal pathogens. In a Veggie experiment (VEG-01C), Zinnia
hybrida plants were infected by an opportunistic fungal pathogen,
Fusarium oxysporum18,19. F. oxysporum is a ubiquitous group of
soilborne fungi that are highly adaptable to different habitats
and include non-pathogenic strains, plant pathogens, and even
opportunistic
human pathogens20.
Pathogenic
strains
of
F.
oxysporum can cause Fusarium wilt in nearly every agriculturally
important crop21. Some multi-host isolates in plants also have the
potential to cause invasive fungal infections in immunocompro-
mised mammals22–25. Even though the fungal infection on the
Zinnia plants was likely due to a malfunction of a fan in the Veggie
hardware26, it demonstrated the importance of characterizing
the healthy basal microbiome of all plants cultivated in space.
To achieve this goal, methodologies are needed to regularly
monitor changes in the microbial community during ﬂight to
potentially mitigate the rise of pathogenic taxa. Currently, the
standard protocol for the investigation of plant–pathogen

interactions aboard the ISS is to harvest the plant material, freeze
it, and return it to Earth for analysis27. However, with future
missions beyond Low Earth Orbit likely taking up to 6 months
between resupply missions, it will be critical to develop faster,
on-side
methodologies
to
regularly
monitor
and
assess
plant–microbe health.
Here we present a method for using metatranscriptomics
coupled with nanopore sequencing to characterize the plant
microbiome and their functional activity from plant–microbe total
RNA samples that could be feasibly completed on-orbit. Meta-
transcriptomics has emerged as an effective methodology to
characterize the plant microbiome and evaluate its transcriptional
activity28. Transcriptional surveys, among many others, enable the
identiﬁcation and assessment of the main drivers of changes in
plant health29–32. However, to date, metatranscriptomic studies of
plant microbiomes have all utilized Illumina sequencing platforms,
which are not feasible for spaceﬂight applications due to their
large up-mass, weight, and footprint. The pocket-sized, USB-
powered nanopore MinION, sequencing platform, which weighs
<100 g and is capable of single-molecule sequencing of native
full-length DNA and RNA molecules33, has emerged as a viable
sequence platform for spaceﬂight. In 2016, the nanopore-
sequencing system was successfully used aboard the ISS for
DNA analysis and compared to next-generation sequencing
platforms, such as Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII34. Although
the nanopore system has been successfully used for DNA
applications, its use for metatranscriptomic analyses is only now
emerging35–38 and has not yet been used to analyze the
metatranscriptome of microbial transcripts from plant–microbe
total RNA samples.
As a proof-of-concept, we have characterized the microbiome
of red romaine lettuce grown under a baseline condition (i.e., ISS-
like ground controls) using MinION-based metatranscriptomics to
demonstrate that plants can be rapidly and effectively screened
using
this
molecular
approach.
By
developing
reliable
methodologies to regularly monitor and compare changes in
the functional activity of the plant microorganisms over time, early
detection of opportunistic pathogens can help inform mitigation
strategies and provide important insight into agricultural practices
aboard spacecraft to maximize crop production and ensure crew
safety on long-duration missions.
RESULTS
Successful enrichment of the microbial RNA fraction from
total RNA
To ensure a comprehensive assessment of the microbes on the
edible portion of the lettuce crop, both endophytic and epiphytic
microbes of lettuce leaves were collected from plants grown in
environmental chambers at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) that
mimicked conditions used aboard the ISS. Salad crops, such as
lettuce, are important target crops for establishing a sustainable
source of fresh food onboard a spacecraft, as they require minimal
processing and can be consumed raw. The lettuce leaves were
collected from three individual plants grown for 28 days in
separate pots (denoted as L93, L96, and L101) each derived from a
single surface-sanitized seed (see “Methods”)39. From each leaf,
total RNA was extracted and then the microbial RNA fraction was
enriched (Fig. 1a).
The high quality of the RNA derived from both the host and
associated microbes is depicted in Fig.1a. Effective depletion of
the host RNA was observed with the mean loss of 93% of the total
RNA (L93, 96.28%; L96, 88.89%; L101, 94.62%), leaving only a
residual ribosomal RNA (rRNA) peak for all replicates (Fig.1b). This
percentage removal of host RNA was consistent with reports from
similar studies that enriched for microbial RNA40,41, indicating that
the newly developed enrichment protocol for bacterial messenger
RNA (mRNA) was effective at removing a large quantity of plant
transcripts.

Overview of MinION-sequencing effectiveness of microbe-
enriched metatranscriptome
The extracted RNA was converted to complementary DNA
(cDNA),
as
currently
the
Oxford
Nanopore
direct
RNA-
sequencing kit does not yet enable barcoding and lower levels
of starting template can be used. The replicate cDNA libraries
were successfully run on individual MinION ﬂowcells and
generated a mean of 10,012,033 base-called reads per replicate
pot (Table 1). A detailed ﬁgure of the bioinformatic pipeline used
in this study is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. After read
processing and ﬁltering, the L93, L96, and L101 samples
consisted
of
4,061,546
(58.34%),
10,730,313
(84.95%),
and
7,361,010 (70.49%) high-quality reads, respectively (Table 1).
The ﬁltered reads were then mapped to the lettuce (Lactuca
sativa)
and
closely
related
sunﬂower
(Helianthus
annuus)
genomes, which are both well-characterized members of the
Asteraceae family. All reads that mapped to either lettuce (L93,
19.17%; L96, 22.72%; L101, 7.23%) or sunﬂower (L93, 3.53%; L96,
5.52%; L101, 1.71%) were removed. Of the remaining reads, most
encoded rRNAs (L93, 63.10%; L96 93.75%; L101, 69.34%) were
removed for a separate taxonomic analysis. Of the rRNA
transcripts, most were associated with the plant host and only
the microbial 16S and non-host 18S rRNA reads were retained for
taxonomic analysis with 521,345 (26.32%), 2,453,876 (33.99%),
and 1,315,470 (28.31%) reads in L93, L96, and L101, respectively
(Table 1).
Of the remaining non-rRNA reads, only 57,315 (4.95%), 104,111
(21.64%), and 88,850 (4.32%) reads from the samples L93, L96, and
L101, respectively, had an e-value cutoff of 0.05 similar to known
proteins in the UniProt Swiss-Prot database (Table 1). Those
microbial transcripts that could be annotated were further
mapped against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) database to identify those functional genes with a KEGG
Orthology (KO) identiﬁer, resulting in the annotation of 2689
transcripts in L93, 1283 transcripts in L96, and 4987 transcripts in
L101 (Table 1).
Taxonomic composition of 28-day-old lettuce leaf microbial
community
The
transcriptionally
active
composition
of
the
microbial
communities and their relative abundance were characterized
using the recovered 16S and non-host 18S rRNA transcripts to
identify those taxa that associate with the lettuce leaf tissue. A
total of 43 microbial phyla from all 3 microbial domains—
Archaea,
Bacteria,
and
Eukarya—were
identiﬁed
in
these
samples and are listed in Supplementary Dataset 1. Focus was
placed on the recovered reads associated with bacteria and
fungi, and the normalized percent abundances are illustrated in
Fig.
2a.
Due
to
the
potential
for
misaligned
chloroplast
transcripts, all reads that were unclassiﬁed or assigned to the
Cyanobacteria phylum were excluded from the taxonomic
analyses. Of the ﬁve most abundant microbial phyla in the
lettuce
leaf
microbiomes,
four
were
bacterial
(Firmicutes,
Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and one was
fungal (Ascomycota), which together comprised 15.48% of the
community in sample L93, 13.13% in sample L96, and 15.04% in
sample L101 (Supplementary Dataset 1).
Within these ﬁve most abundant phyla, a total of 1240 genera
were identiﬁed (Supplementary Dataset 1); however, only those
genera that had at least 500 normalized reads in all three samples
were depicted in Fig. 2b. For each genus, the percentage listed
was calculated from the total number of reads for that genus
across all three samples relative to the total number of reads
across all samples. The top ten most abundant genera within the

phyla
included

Together, the top eight transcriptionally active bacterial genera

(Fig. 2b).
Functional activity of the lettuce leaf microbial community
Assessment of the expressed transcripts within the lettuce leaf
microbiome
revealed
a
diverse
range
of
functional
genes
associated with several key metabolic pathways in both the
bacterial (Fig. 3a) and fungal (Fig. 3b) populations. Only those
genes with a minimum of ﬁve transcripts across all samples were
included. The full list of genes and their associated KEGG level 3
pathways are listed in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3. A total of 106
bacterial KEGG level 3 pathways (Supplementary Fig. 2) and a total
of 85 fungal KEGG level 3 pathways (Supplementary Fig. 3) were
observed.
Within the lettuce-associated bacterial community, the top 15
bacterial KEGG level 3 pathways comprised 94.28% of the reads
that were assigned to 106 distinct pathways (Supplementary
Fig. 2). The two most dominant metabolisms observed within the
lettuce-associated bacterial community transcriptome were the
glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism with a mean of 47.64%
of the transcripts and oxidative phosphorylation with a mean of
40.33% transcripts mapping to this pathway (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Fig. 2).
As visualized in the fungal metatranscriptome heatmap, the top
15 KEGG level 3 fungal pathways accounted for 84.11% of the
total read counts that were assigned to 85 distinct pathways
(Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 3, and Supplementary Dataset 2). The
two dominant fungal pathways observed in the lettuce-associated
microbiome included thermogenesis with a mean of 30.43% of
the annotated transcripts and oxidative phosphorylation with a
mean of 30.25%. Interestingly, the expression of transcripts
associated with several distinct signal transduction pathways
was observed including the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathways (4.10%), phospholipase D signaling
pathway (1.20%), two-component system (0.74%), FoxO signaling
pathway (0.63%), and Rap1 signaling pathway (0.63%) (Fig. 3b and
Supplementary Dataset 2).

two main clusters with high levels of connectivity. In cluster 1,
genes associated with a diverse set of KEGG level 3 pathways were
intertwined and observed to have some similarity in expression
patterns across all three samples. The edges connecting each
gene in cluster 1 were longer, which showed more variation in
expression patterns between each sample. However, cluster
2 showed an enrichment of genes primarily associated with the
MAPK signaling pathway that have remarkably similar expression
patterns across all three samples as the edges between genes are

pathway within the fungal community may exhibit a coordinated,
co-expression pattern.
DISCUSSION
To prepare for a long-duration spaceﬂight, it will be critical to
develop effective and rapid monitoring tools to evaluate changes
in the microbiomes associated with both the spacecraft and the
organisms within. In this study, we described such a methodology
for analyzing the metatranscriptome of the microbial communities
associated with lettuce crops using the nanopore MinION-
sequencing platform. Speciﬁcally, we have optimized an enrich-
ment protocol and analysis pipeline for microbial transcripts from
plant–microbe total RNA using the nanopore MinION, which can
serve as a foundation for future onboard plant monitoring. In
addition, the results from this study provide a ﬁrst look into the
metatranscriptome of the lettuce microbiome grown under ISS-
like environmental conditions.
By understanding the complexity of plant–microbe relation-
ships, the underlying drivers that either maintain or perturb these
associations in the space environment can be identiﬁed8. One
challenge, however, is to ascertain how these changes to
plant–microbe associations occur across different temporal and
spatial scales. Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a viable
platform to address these challenges and its applications to
monitor changes in microbial communities aboard the ISS using
metagenomics are now emerging34. However, its applications to
examine metatranscriptome changes within a community is
relatively new.
One aspect of using nanopore sequencing for metatranscrip-
tome analysis that had to be optimized was the low signal of the
native
surface
and
endophytic
microbial
transcripts
from
plant–microbial total RNA41. In this study, we developed an
enrichment protocol for microbial RNAs through the depletion of
plant mRNA and rRNA from the lettuce samples. As visualized in
Fig. 1, there was an enrichment of the microbial RNA as the
depletion of the host RNA resulted in an average loss of ~93% of
the total RNA. However, it was evident that there were still residual
plant RNA molecules in our library construction (Table 1). The
remaining plant RNA was likely attributed to the use of a
commercial plant RiboMinus kit that has not been thoroughly
optimized for the lettuce species. For instance, although the
lettuce 18S ribosomal sequence aligned well with the 18S probe,
the incomplete lettuce 28S sequence on the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database made it difﬁcult to
assess how well the kit would work on lettuce samples.
In addition, the results also demonstrated that for long-term
monitoring of speciﬁc food crops, species-speciﬁc ribosomal
probes will need to be designed for host organisms to improve
the removal of host RNAs and facilitate the microbial RNA
enrichment process. Even though an average of 73.69% of the
UniProt-annotated mRNA reads were mostly plant-derived, a
substantial number of those reads were associated with cellular
components
associated
with
the
chloroplast.

similarities between chloroplast RNA and cyanobacteria42, these

results suggest that removal of plant host organelle sequences
through synthetic oligomers43 prior to sequencing will be required
for optimum enrichment of microbial RNA.
Although this protocol has the potential to be completely
conducted in space by the crew, a substantial amount of
reﬁnement of our protocols coupled with technology on board
the ISS will be needed to make it more practical for being
performed in microgravity on a regular basis. These improvements
include the automation of molecular protocols, such as sample
puriﬁcation
and
library
preparation
with
microﬂuidics.
The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA, is currently
developing tools, such as µTitan44, to facilitate autonomous
nucleic acid extraction and is also working with companies such
Oxford Nanopore Technologies to facilitate autonomous library
preparations and magnetic puriﬁcation with the VolTRAX-v2
hardware in microgravity45. Thus, this is the ﬁrst step of many
towards being able to investigate plant–microbial interactions on
board the ISS and other low Earth orbit spacecraft. Such
capabilities will ultimately advance our understanding of the
plant–microbial interactions holistically in the spaceﬂight environ-
ment, which will allow for innovative preventative and proactive
care of the crops so as to improve our ability to establish a safe
and sustainable space agriculture.
Currently, the sample preparation from plant tissue to library
prep for MinION sequencing takes ~8 h and sequencing on the
ﬂowcell can run up to 48 h for deeper coverage. The data
generated will then be put through the bioinformatics pipeline
and followed by data analysis. Hence, depending on the level of
detail required, monitoring the functional activity of the plant
microbiome with this protocol, from harvesting samples to
analyzing the generated sequences, may take ~2–5 days. Future
development to optimize and automate this protocol for ﬂight
application could shorten the time requirements, which is a stark
contrast to current capabilities, as it took ~12 months to
determine the primary causal agent of the F. oxysporum infection
on Zinnia plants on board the ISS27.
In addition, this initial study provides important insight into the
diversity and transcriptional activity of the L. sativa cv “Out-
redgeous” lettuce leaf microbiome grown under ISS-like condi-
tions. Normalized 16S and 18S rRNA reads from each sample were
categorized into 43 different phyla (Supplementary Dataset 1) and
were consistent across the three biological replicates, which were
each run on separate MinION ﬂowcells. Within the top 5 phyla, 39
genera with more than 500 reads in all 3 replicates were
highlighted in Fig. 3b and the most transcriptionally active
bacterial taxa were Peptoniphilus spp. and Clostridium spp.
Peptoniphilus are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci that uses
peptone as a major energy source and produces butyrate as a
major metabolic end product46. Butanoate metabolism was
represented as part of the carbohydrate metabolism in the full
bacterial heatmap (Supplementary Fig. 2). Peptoniphilus were also
found to be one of the most abundant phyllosphere taxa found on
tomato leaf samples47 and are, therefore, common taxa in
plant–microbe interactions.
Clostridium, the other highly transcriptionally active taxa, is an
extremely heterogeneous genus of bacteria that is ubiquitous in a
wide range of environments, such as soil, sewage, and the
intestines of humans and animals48,49. Some Clostridium species,
such as Clostridium botulinum, are known pathogens that can form
vegetative cells under certain conditions, which produce a fatal
toxin to humans50,51. However, Clostridium species are commonly
found on lettuce leaves and can be efﬁciently removed through
proper washing of the leaves before consumption51. Therefore,
these results again reinforce the importance of regular monitoring
of the transcriptional and metabolic activity of taxa within plant
growth habitats during spaceﬂight.
The taxonomic results derived from this developed method
differed from previous metagenomic analyses on the lettuce leaf
microbiome and reinforce the importance of conducting on-site
analyses of the plant microbiome17. For example, neither genera
Peptoniphilus or Clostridium were observed in the previous
metagenomic analysis17. In that study, the top ﬁve recovered
taxa were Bacillus, Burkholderia, Macrococcus, Methylobacterium,
and Staphylococcus, which were observed in our metatranscrip-
tome data (Fig. 2b), but at lower relative abundances. Interest-
ingly, Thermogemmatispora, which was their most abundant
genera in almost all their samples, and Pelomonas were not
detected in our dataset. These differences in the taxonomy
diversity results between the metatranscriptomic and metage-
nomic approaches are not unexpected. Metagenomic analysis are
based on DNA molecules, which could come from non-viable
microorganisms52, whereas the metatranscriptomic approach
based on the RNA molecules provides insight into the functionally
active microbial community. Despite the differences in the two
approaches, there were still substantial overlaps in the taxonomic
composition of the lettuce microbiome, especially for the bacterial
community, suggesting the nanopore sequencing of the meta-
transcriptome
was
highly
complementary
to
the
previous
metagenomic studies on lettuce microbiome17.
Within the observed fungal community, the most transcription-
ally active taxa were Fusarium spp. and Colletotrichum spp. (Fig.
2b). Both these genera are known to have species with strains that
are plant pathogens. These cosmopolitan fungi have a broad
range of hosts and can cause wilt diseases and anthracnose
attacks in many major agricultural crops53–55. However, as there
are many species and strains within each of these genera of fungi
that are not pathogenic, the speciﬁc ecological role of the
recovered taxa could not be fully assessed. The use of this
nanopore metatranscriptomic sequencing approach could be
used to prioritize samples and taxa for downstream in-depth
sequencing, to ascertain the pathogenic potential, if any, of
recovered fungal taxa.
The metatranscriptomic analyses of the transcribed functional
genes of the bacterial and fungal community were largely
consistent with the core functional microbiome in other phyllo-
sphere microbial systems reported in the literature56,57. In our
study, within the top 15 most actively transcribed bacterial
pathways (Fig.3a), “Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism” had
47.64% of the total reads and “Oxidative phosphorylation” had
40.33% of the total reads. This result was not unexpected, because
glyoxylate metabolism is known to be involved in the metabolism
of short carbon compounds (one or two carbons), which are an
important energy source for leaf-associated bacteria58. Oxidative
phosphorylation is a vital part of metabolism, as the end product
is adenosine triphosphate and is required for a myriad of cellular
processes.
Most of the top bacterial pathways listed in our study (Fig. 3) are
typically involved in essential housekeeping activities and are
necessary for bacterial survival. However, signal transduction and
environmental adaptation pathways could provide some indica-
tion as to how the plants are responding to their environment. For
example, the high number of reads that mapped to the two-
component system pathway might suggest the need to sense and
quickly respond to environmental factors by phosphorylating and
dephosphorylating proteins, whereas the plant–pathogen inter-
action pathway could indicate a biotic stress response59.
In the fungal metatranscriptome, “Oxidative phosphorylation”
and “Thermogenesis” were the most actively transcribed pathways.
In addition to oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondria also
engage in thermogenesis, which uncouples the oxidative phos-
phorylation for heat production in organisms60. However, intrigu-
ingly, about a quarter of all the KEGG level 3 pathways listed
(Supplementary Fig. 3) were associated with the signal transduction
pathway. Many of these were also seen in the top 15 most actively
transcribed fungal pathways (Fig. 3b). The most actively transcribed
signal transduction pathway in the fungal metatranscriptome was

the MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 3b). The MAPK pathway plays
important roles in fungal physiology and development, as it
governs diverse growth processes such as mating, cell cycle control,
morphogenesis (e.g., ﬁlamentation), response to different stresses,
cell wall assembly and integrity, pathogenicity, cell to cell signaling,
fungal–plant interactions, and response to damage-associated
molecular patterns61–63.
From our metatranscriptomic dataset, we can map genes
expressed to speciﬁc processes within the MAPK signaling
pathway in yeast (Supplementary Fig. 4). This result suggests
that the fungi within the lettuce microbiome may be actively
engaged in cell wall remodeling and proliferation. Moreover,
the gene network mapping of the signal transduction tran-
scripts showed high levels for connectivity of genes (i.e., SST2,
STE7, GDP1, SHO1, and CLA4) within the MAPK pathways, which
indicates that these are tightly connected processes in the
fungal community (Fig. 4). Interestingly, many of these genes
also overlap with fungal pathogenesis61,64 and, although this
does not necessarily indicate active pathogenicity, it would be
beneﬁcial for the crew to monitor these genes over time in their
food crops.
Currently, many of the commercially available portable rapid
plant disease diagnostic tools are based on immunodetection
methods (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays), PCR-based
assays, and spectrometry-based protocols, which require some
prior prediction of the microbial organisms that are being
tested, to design antibodies or PCR primers for the analyses65,66.
The MinION platform has great advantages when dealing with
diagnosing plant pathogens and plant–microbial analysis, as it
uses shotgun sequencing technology that requires no prior
knowledge or prediction about the possible causative agent.
The detection of any microbial organisms, even at low levels, is
limited to the microbial sequences available in the NCBI
database.
Although this study described the analysis of the lettuce
microbiome at a single time point, the methodology developed
in this study has the potential to enable the comparative
analyses of the lettuce microbiome across spatial and temporal
scales to identify potential drivers of change during plant
growth and development. The complementary use of rapid
nanopore-sequencing approaches with additional more in-
depth metagenomic sequencing of viable microorganisms will
enable baselines of health to be regularly monitored in plant
growth habitats aboard spacecraft. These comparisons will also
enable more reﬁned approaches to understand how the
microbiome changes under environmental perturbations and
contributes to healthy plant growth and development during a
long-duration spaceﬂight.
METHODS
Sample collection and RNA extraction
Seeds of red romaine lettuce, L. sativa cv “Outredgeous” were surface-
sanitized with a bleach-hydrochloric acid solution (30 ml 6% Pure Bright
Germicidal Ultra Bleach and 500 μl 37% hydrochloric acid) for 1 h and
allowed to off-gas for 24 h prior to planting. Sanitization was veriﬁed by
placing seeds on trypticase soy agar and inhibitory mold agar plates, and
incubating for 48–72 h at 30 °C18. A standard validation protocol was used
to conform the effectiveness of the sanitization protocol26. No bacterial or
fungal growth was observed on the plates during the screening process.
Three surface-sanitized seeds were individually placed in 4 inch pots
containing greens-grade arcillite, a calcined clay and time-release fertilizer
typically used in spaceﬂight hardware26, and were grown in environmen-
tally controlled growth chambers at the KSC that mimicked conditions of
the ISS. The growth chambers were cleaned to remove any potential
human-associated microbes before use, but were not sterilized.
To simulate conditions aboard the ISS, the plants were maintained at
50% relative humidity, 3000 p.p.m. CO2, and 23 °C. The growth cycle was
established on a 16 h (light)/8 h (dark) cycle under ﬂuorescent cool white
lights (200–300 μE m−2 s−1) and all were on daily automatic watering with
deionized water. Pots were thinned to one plant each at day 7 and samples
were harvested at day 28 for leafy greens. Lettuce leaf tissue from each of
the three pots (denoted as L93, L96, and L101) was placed immediately
into RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and stored at −80 °C until
ready for RNA extraction.
Total RNA was extracted from each of the three lettuce leave replicates
with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The recovered RNA was DNase-treated with the
optional on-column digestion following the manufacturer’s protocol
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantiﬁed using Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA). A sample of clean RNAlater was used as a
negative control throughout the sample preparation process. No RNA was
obtained or ampliﬁed from the negative control sample.
Enrichment of microbial transcripts
An enrichment method was developed to enable the separation of plant
and microbial RNAs for subsequent sequencing with the Oxford
Nanopore-sequencing technology41. Using the recovered host–microbial
total RNA (7.33–23.56 µg), the Dynabeads poly(A) capture protocol
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA) was performed to remove poly
(A)-containing RNAs (e.g., plant mRNAs). Of note, plants and fungi both
have poly(A)-containing mRNA. It is therefore likely that some of the
fungal RNA were also removed during the enrichment process. The
remaining poly(A)-depleted material (microbial mRNA/rRNA and plant
rRNA) was then puriﬁed with the Zymo RNA clean and concentration kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The
remaining RNAs were processed using the RiboMinus Plant Kit for the
removal of plant rRNA as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA). The host-depleted RNA (1–10 μg) from each
sample was then A-tailed using Poly(A) polymerase (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 25 min at 37 °C. The enriched microbial RNA
(mRNA and rRNA) quantity was assessed with a Qubit 2.0 ﬂuorometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA) and quality was assessed using a
2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). To assess
the purity of RNA, A260/280 readings were also taken with the UV-1800
Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The samples
were stored at −80 °C until library preparation.
Nanopore cDNA-PCR library preparation
Library preparation for cDNA-PCR sequencing was performed using the
SQK-PCS109 sequencing kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Brieﬂy, 50 ng of enriched
microbial RNA samples from L93, L96, and L101 were reverse transcribed
using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA) and incubated in a thermal cycler at 42 °C for 90 min and
then 85 °C for 5 min. To amplify the products without introducing biases,
full-length transcripts were selected using the Nanopore rapid attachment
primers (SQK-PCS109) using LongAmp Taq 2× Master Mix (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) with the following cycling conditions, an initial
denaturing step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 14 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C,
15 s at 62 °C, and 1 min at 65 °C, and a ﬁnal extension step at 65 °C for
6 min and a hold at 4 °C. The products were then puriﬁed and separated
using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN)
with 1.8 (v/v) ratio of magnetic beads to the reaction mixture. The cDNA
library using 100 fmol of ampliﬁed cDNA with adapters was loaded onto a
FLO-MIN106D R9 ﬂowcell and sequencing was performed with a MinION
device for 48 h. cDNA derived from each replicate (L93, L96, L101) were
sequenced on individual ﬂowcells to provide information about the
process reproducibility and variability.
Bioinformatics and data analysis.
RNA-sequencing data were base-called
in real-time using an integrated version of Guppy in the MinKNOW
software v3.3.2 via the MinIT device v19.05.2. All FASTQ ﬁles were
concatenated and used in the bioinformatics pipeline illustrated in
Supplementary Fig. 1. Brieﬂy, MinION-sequencing statistics were analyzed
using Nanoplot v1.0.067 and adapters were trimmed using Porechop
v0.2.468. Reads were ﬁltered for a minimum read length of 100 bp and
minimum Q-score of 5 using ﬁltlong v0.2.0 was to ensure that >80% of the
reads in all three samples were as previously described69. Large chimeric
reads of >30,000 bp were also ﬁltered out using a Unix shell command. The
N50 read length, which is deﬁned as the read length such that reads of this
length or greater composes at least 50% of the total bases, was 417, 616,

and 512 bp for the L93, L96, and L101 samples, respectively, whereas the
average read length across all samples was 443 bp (Table 1).
To remove any residual host plant transcripts and rRNA, reads were
mapped to well-assembled genomes within the Asteraceae family (e.g.,
lettuce and sunﬂower) using Bowtie270, then screened with SortMeRNA
v2.171 and removed. Taxonomic classiﬁcation of microbial 16S and 18S rRNA
reads was performed with Kraken2 v2.0.8b72 using the kraken2-microbial
database
(https://lomanlab.github.io/mockcommunity/mc_databases.html)
derived from the NCBI Reference Sequence database (release 89)73. Reads
counts were normalized across all three samples and only operational
taxonomic units with >500 assigned reads were included and visualized
with bubble plots created using the R package ggplot2 v3.3.074.
The remaining metatranscriptome sequences were annotated with
Trinotate v3.0 (http://trinotate.github.io) using BLAST + v2.9.075 against the
Uniprot database76. No assembly was performed on the reads before the
annotation, as only high-quality long reads were used in the downstream
analyses; this approach has previously been used to annotate MinION-
derived reads77,78. Apart from fungi, coding sequences assigned to viruses
and other eukaryotes were excluded in the downstream analysis so as to
focus on the microbial activity found associated with the lettuce leaf. In
addition, transcripts derived from taxa assigned to Cyanobacteria, which
represented a substantial number of reads (Supplementary Dataset 1), as
well as transcripts associated with photosynthesis genes (Supplementary
Dataset 2), were excluded to prevent the inclusion of possible misassigned
chloroplast transcripts. Abundance of transcripts that had KEGG annota-
tions79 were normalized using gene-length corrected transcripts per million
method followed by Trimmed Mean of M-values method as implemented in
EdgeR80. KEGG-annotated association with their respective pathways were
performed using the R package KEGGREST81. Heatmaps were generated
using
the
Broad
Institute’s
webtool
Morpheus
(https://software.
broadinstitute.org/morpheus). The hierarchical clustering of the full heat-
maps were done using the one minus Pearson’s correlation metric in
Morpheus. The gene networking analysis was completed using the R
package Phyloseq v1.19.180,82.
