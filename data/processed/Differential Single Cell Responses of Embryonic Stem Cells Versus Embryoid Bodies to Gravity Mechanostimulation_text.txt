Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells
Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation
Cassandra M. Juran,1 Justina Zvirblyte,1,2 and Eduardo A.C. Almeida3
The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during
early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceﬂight, reduces normal mechanical loading of
organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is
known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types
respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with
single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5kPa hydrostatic pressure,
inﬂuences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study
included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single
cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in
either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs,
indicating the inﬂuence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the
developmental program. More speciﬁcally, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in
ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular
development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs
show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-
expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse
but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identiﬁed three branching cell types
susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC
maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed
to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.

Introduction
D
ifferentiation, stem cell fate decisions and devel-
opmental patterning are regulated by a variety of spa-
tiotemporal inﬂuences. The mechanical environment, deﬁned
by unit gravity on Earth, is one such inﬂuencer, modulating
cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions via physical strain
sensing through integrin and cadherin adhesion receptor
signaling. These physical strains are then converted into cell
signaling and transcriptional responses by a process termed
mechanotransduction [1–3]. In a whole organism the tissue
mechanical environment can be regulated by intrinsic factors
such as blood pressure, muscle contraction, and others, or by
extrinsic factors such as gravity weight-bearing and posture.
Also, of importance are the cyclic nature of these normal
loading and unloading processes.
On Earth, mammalian tissues normal hydrostatic pres-
sures due to vascular activity can vary in the range of

0.2–16 kPa, while pressures can go as high as 5–6 MPa in
weight-bearing bone and cartilage and to 18MPa while
running or jumping [4]. However, the calculated hydrostatic
pressure in a standard static mammalian laboratory cell cul-
ture (with a ﬂuid medium with density of 1 kg/m3 and height
of 1 cm, at 1 g) is only about 0.1 kPa, well below normal
tissue physiological mechanical loading conditions.
To simulate physiologically relevant ranges of mechanical
loads in cell cultures, various strategies have been used in-
cluding applying cyclic stretch [5], or pulses of hydrostatic
pressure [6], and hypergravity (HG) [7], that often result in
enhanced cellular proliferation and differentiation effects. In
the unique environment of space, free fall-induced weight-
lessness can modulate the intrinsic factors of tissue me-
chanical environment leading to reduced mechanical loads in
tissue niche environments [8]. Modeling the effects of mi-
crogravity on Earth has been attempted with a multitude of
strategies; however, many of these strategies in an effort to
replicate free fall, generate non-physiologic ﬂuid shear and
rotational loading to the cells [9]. The interesting observation
that traditional static cell culture plating results in pressure
loading well below the physiologically relevant range may
provide a unique path for cellular level modeling of the mi-
crogravity free fall environment.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are primary stem cells that
can be turned toward speciﬁc fates by exclusive modulation
of mechanical environment [10,11]. However, these meth-
ods often induce ESC differentiation to a single cell type,
removing the cultures from physiologic relevance. Embry-
oid bodies (EBs) are a three-dimensional (3D) model of
embryo development inclusive of all pre-implant cell line-
ages and germ layers within 7–12 days, providing a physi-
ologically relevant platform for regenerative medicine and
developmental studies [12,13]. Investigations of 3D EB
models exposed to mechanical perturbation are rare, and
rarer still are transcriptomic characterization of mechan-
otransduction regulation of development.
The most studied physical stress relevant to the EB model
is ﬂuid shear stress [14], imparted by spinner ﬂasks [15] or
microﬂuidic channels [16,17], or rotating wall vessels [9]
used in their culture. Generally, these studies have shown
that ﬂuidic shear stress promotes growth and maturation;
however, this general observation has been reﬁned as the
study of mechanical regulation of EBs has expanded. A 2010
study presented data that controlling the speed of hydrody-
namic stimulation changes viability of the cells within the
spheroid [18]. More direct stretch mechanical loading in-
creases angiogenesis within the EB and increases the locali-
zation of beating cardiomyocyte foci [19]. Dynamic cyclic
stretch to EBs encourages differentiation toward mesodermal
lineages with the resulting terminal cell type selectable by
manipulating the compressive and tensile strains [20].
As positive mechanical loading corresponds to increased
differentiation commitment, reduced mechanical strain can
be hypothesized to result in the maintenance of embryonic
potency markers. Hanging drop and suspension EB cultures
found increased apoptotic cell accumulations and irregular
morphology in comparison to rotary ﬂuid shear EB culture
[21], although these may be explained by decreased mass
transport around and inside EB. EBs space ﬂown in low
earth orbit for 15 days under microgravity conditions re-
tained self-renewal markers and showed inhibition of ESC
differentiation and germ layer lineage markers, however,
upon return to earth-normal 1 g loading, the EBs demon-
strated increased ability to readily differentiate into beating
cardiomyocytes [22,23]. These results mirror ﬁndings that
EBs derived from ESCs exposed to ﬂuidic shear stress be-
fore aggregation are primed for differentiation, resulting in
increased endothelial markers and spatial organization [24].
Mechanically regulated engineerability of developmental
models has application in tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine as self-organization and patterning are necessary for
functional repair or replacement of tissue deﬁcits. An inter-
mediate step for development of many organoid models is
induced pluripotent stem cell aggregation into EBs before
additional chemical treatment [25], thus transcriptomic in-
formation from the EB stage could help improve ﬁdelity of
organoids and the research for which they are utilized.
However, lack of a thorough understanding of transcriptomic
regulation within difﬁcult-to-access EB spheroids has hin-
dered the development of the ﬁeld.
Novel single cell transcriptomic approaches are beginning
to bridge this deﬁcit with recent work describing pre-
implantation embryos and in vitro EBs [26], germ layer de-
velopmental trajectory [27,28], and organoid efﬁcacy as-
sessment [29,30]. The use of single cell resolution has
enabled detection of transient cell populations existing be-
tween established embryo staging, providing further insight
into developmental programs, lineage decision omics and has
exposed potential new cell classiﬁcations as targets for di-
rected differentiation [27,28]. Our investigation utilizes single
cell transcriptomics technology to probe how the absence of
mechanical perturbation, similar to microgravity unloading,
alters developmental programing in the EB model compared
to a single pulse of physiologically relevant loading by HG.

ClonalC57BL/6J ESCs (ATCC SCRC-1002)wereseededat
3E6 cells in a 10cm2 tissue culture dish coated with 0.1%
gelatin (Fig. 1A). The mESCs were expanded for two passages
in mESC medium (Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium sup-
plemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine,
1 · nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% an-

mercaptoethanol, and 10ng/mL leukemia inhibitory factor
[LIF]). The mediumwas changeddailyand cellswerepassaged
every 48h using 0.25% trypsin solution and re-seeded at 3E6
cells per dish before reaching experimental maturity (Fig. 1A,
C). After the second expansion, a subset of the mESCs (6E6
cells per dish) were transferred to an ultra-low adhesion 10cm2
tissueculture dishes and LIFremovedfromthe culture mediato

media was changed daily and cell aggregation was inspected
using a Leica DMi1 inverted light microscope.
The EBs were cultured for 5-days before further proces-
sing. On the ﬁfth day, EBs were seeded onto 0.1% (w/v)
collagen coated platinum-treated silicon membranes and
allowed to adhere and outgrow for 4 days (Fig. 1D). After
the 4 days, the EB cultures and control mESC cultures were
exposed to a 1-h HG pulse of 50 g in a cell culture 1 ft-
diameter centrifuge. The acceleration level of 50 g used in
this study with a 1 cm medium column above adherent cells

results in a calculated hydrostatic pressure of about 5 kPa
corresponding to a mid-range physiological value for
mammalian non-load bearing tissues (P ¼ qgh, where q is
the density of the medium in kilogram per cubic meter, g
is gravity acceleration in meter per second squared, and h is
the depth of the liquid in meter). Centrifugation was per-
formed using a custom modiﬁed (vented lid) Eppendorf
5804 1 ft diameter rotor centrifuge with multi-well plate
adapters inside an environmental chamber with 5% carbon
dioxide, 37C, and 90% humidity. After mechanostimula-
tion, the cultures were continued for a further 6 h, allowing
for transcriptomic response under static 1 g conditions.

Single cell library preparation, sequencing, analysis,
and visualization
The EB and ESC cultures were dissociated into single cell
suspension and prepared for 10·Genomics RNA sequencing
according to the Gene Expression Proﬁling v2 chemistry pro-
tocol (10 ·Genomics). The four conditions evaluated were
mESC control and HG mechanical pulse stimulated and EB
control and HG mechanical pulse stimulated (respectively
ESC_C, ESC_HG, EB_C, EB_HG). After Illumina sequencing,
the
samples
were
demultiplexed
and
analyzed
using
10 ·Genomics CellRanger software v4.0 to produce barcode,
gene expression, and library identiﬁcation matrices. These da-
tasets were then assessed for clustering by Seurat and for de-
velopmental trajectory by Monocle 2 and 3 to produce our data
visualizations in t-distributed stochastic neighbor (tSNE), uni-
form manifold approximation, and projection (UMAP) statis-
tical and Pseudotime relationship mapping methods. Additional
details in Supplemental Methodologies (Supplementary Data).
Results
1/3 of mechanoregulated genes are shared
between ESCs and day 9 EBs
Single cell tSNE mapping of ESCs and EBs show that a
60-min HG pulse results in minimal deviation in cellular
transcriptomic signature (Fig. 1G). Cell mapping shows that
most ESC cells share general overlap between the HG pulse
(red) and unstimulated controls (blue); However, HG pulse
EB cells have areas in the tSNE space largely populated by
HG pulse cells with minimal EB non-pulse control cells
(Fig. 1G—area largely populated by HG pulse cells indi-
cated by dashed encirclement). Assessing mechano-induced
(Fig. 1J) or -suppressed (Fig. 1K) differentially expressed
(DE) genes shared between ESCs and EBs show only *1/3
DE genes have common mechanoregulation. In response to
HG pulse EBs show more upregulated genes than ESCs
while ESCs and EBs have similar numbers of down-
regulated genes but fewer are shared.
Gene ontology pathway analysis demonstrates HG
pulse correlates differentiation and developmental
programs to increased mechanotransduction
signaling pathways
When single cell expression information was assessed by
Gene Ontology (GO) Consensus Pathway Analysis (CPA) [31]
the DE genes were found to be related to developmental
pathways, mechanotransduction, and genomic stress/repair
mechanisms. Figure 2 presents the GO-CPA mapping and
expression heatmaps for the highest DE genes from each
pathway. The pathways presented are highly connected, indi-
cating organized response to mechanical loading (Fig. 2A).
HG pulse EBs DE genes show organized upregulation com-
pared to no-pulse EBs expression while the HG pulse ESC
cells show upregulation of many genes within the pathways
but many also have no expression change, indicating cellular
response to loading but not organized change in the population
transcriptome (Fig. 2B–D). Genes associated with angiogen-
esis are the exception as ESCs cultured under HG pulse show
organized upregulation of genes while the EBs do not.
HG pulse increases EB growth markers in extra-
embryonic tissue cell types and pre- and post-
implant epiblasts
EB UMAP clustering shows little deviation in mathematical
clustering due to HG pulse stimulation (Fig. 3A). Nine clusters
are identiﬁed in both libraries with minimal mapping diver-
gences. ESCs, pre- and post-implantation lineage, primitive
endoderm, germ cells, and extra-embryonic cell general po-
sitions are identiﬁed within the UMAP space. Within the
UMAP reference frame, the application of HG pulse changes
the location of the extra-embryonic cells and cluster 9 is sup-
pressed (indicated by grey boxes). Extra-embryonic cells are
responsible for regulating implantation and development of
the amnion and placental tissue, which are the ﬁrst adherent
cells affected by direct mechanical stimulation and the gene
markers for the trophoblasts (cluster 1 markers include Efna1,
Dab2, Pparg, and Krt18) and extraembryonic ectoderm
(cluster 9—markers include Tfap2a, Hand1, Cdx2, Krt7, and
Wnt6) have increased expression with HG pulse.
Figure 3B visualizes representative marker genes of po-
tency, ESC, primitive endoderm, pre- and post-implantation
epiblast lineages. Cluster-speciﬁc assessment show high
expression of the potency marker Oct4/Pou5f1 in all EB
clusters irrespective of loading condition; However, clusters
5–9 show deviation in the level and normality of the Oct4
expression with HG pulse. Clusters 5–7 deviate toward
greater expression with HG pulse, suggesting maintenance
of potency features within these clusters. Clusters 8 and 9
have reduced expression, suggestive of stem/progenitor cell
commitment to specialization.
HG pulse increases transcriptomic signature
of transitory cells
ESC marker Esrrb is expressed in clusters 3 and 4 inde-
pendent of HG pulse while clusters 5 and 7 express Esrrb
exclusively under conditions of HG pulse. These data sug-
gest maintenance of ‘‘stemness’’ transcriptomic qualities in
cells of clusters 5 and 7 in response to HG pulse. Mapping

models. However, the EBs respond with the greatest number of upregulated genes per pathway and greatest upregulation of
individual genes in response to hypergravity pulse. CPA, consensus pathway analysis; GO, gene ontology.

and expression of Pre-Implant epiblast marker Tfap2c show
expression in no-pulse control EB cells of clusters 4, 5, and
8. Co-expression of ESC marker Esrrb and Pre-Epiblast
marker Tfap2c in cluster 4 indicate a transitory phenotype
between ESC and Pre-Implant epiblast. The application of
HG pulse induces co-expression of Esrrb and Tfap2c in
clusters 5 and 7. This transcriptomic shift shows that HG
pulse increases cells with ESC/Pre-Implant Epiblast transi-
tory phenotype. In the non-pulse control EB cells clusters 5
and 8 express Tfap2c without corresponding ESC marker
expression, deﬁning these cells as non-transitory Epiblasts.
Post-implant epiblast marker Dnmt3b shows co-expression
with pre-implant epiblast clusters 5 and 8. HG pulse results
in additional co-expression of Dnmt3b and Tfap2c in cluster
7 indicating increased pre- to post-implant epiblast transi-
tory cells. Dnmt3b is expressed in clusters 2, 3, 5–8 of both
libraries, implying the majority of cells at day 9 EB culture
are post-implant epiblast transcriptionally identiﬁed cells,
which is consistent with published literature [13,26].
Dmnt3b is expressed in cluster 9 of the no-pulse control EB
cells but not the HG pulse cluster 9 cells, linking post-
implant epiblasts to the extra-embryonic tissue and sug-
gesting a branch point in the developmental program that is
hidden in the single cell trajectory, by mechanism of si-
lencing or acceleration through the developmental program
by the HG pulse.
Primitive endoderm marker Npl is present in cluster 6 of
the no-pulse control cells and cluster 8 of the HG pulse EBs.
The HG pulse cluster 8 identiﬁed primitive endoderm cells
that show co-expression of pre- and post-implant epiblast
markers. Location within the UMAP coordinate system
demonstrates that HG pulse reduces the transcriptomic
separation of pre-implant and primitive endoderm cells
(distance indicated by dashed arrows in Fig. 3). These data
show that early commitment lineages are regulated by the
mechanical environment, and that speciﬁcally HG pulse
stimulation causes transition of cells through the early de-
velopmental program.
HG pulse introduces unique cell signatures but does
not cause divergence from developmental trajectory
in germ layer lineages
To more closely examine how HG pulse inﬂuences cell
transitory transcriptomic signature, Monocle 3 mapping
assigned pseudotime scale to the non-pulse control EB
UMAP and the HG pulse EB UMAP (Fig. 4A). The pseu-
dotime mapping shows that the developmental tracing for
the EB libraries is similar with HG pulse advancing pseu-
dotime distance between the ESCs (cluster 3 cells identiﬁed
as the start of the trajectory) and the terminal cells (ecto-
derm lineage). Monocle trajectory mapping was done to
more directly identify developmental relationship of cells
within the UMAP space (Fig. 4B). The developmental tra-
jectory identiﬁes several branch points unique to the HG
pulse EB cells (Fig. 4C, grey boxes).
Programmatically the ﬁrst branch of cells to diverge from
the main trajectory pathway, labeled as branch point 5 in the
HG pulse trajectory map, was identiﬁed as senescent ESC
(senESC) cell type due to high expression of ESC markers
Oct4/Pou5f1, Esrrb, Zfp42, and Tcf15 in addition to higher
expression of senescence marker Cdkn2a/P16. Branch point
1 cells present transcriptional signatures related to cepha-
locaudal folding (Ceph-Caud), showing co-expression of
genes Atp4a, Foxj1, Nkx2, Ctnnb1, and Wnts, descriptive of
foregut formation. At branch point 3, cells are tran-
scriptomically identiﬁed as Primitive Streak (PS), which are
transitory cells with transcriptomic signature similar to post-
implantation epiblasts (Dnmt3b, Kif1a, Fgf5), markers
consistent with developmental signaling (Wnts, Ctnnb1, Fgf8,
T, Psmb8) and the of the three germ layer lineages (Spink1,
Apob, Postn, Sox11, Pdgfc). These transcriptomically iden-
tiﬁed cells are positioned along the trajectory before the post-
implant epiblast and endoderm branch point, again supporting
that HG pulse encourages maintenance of diversity of tran-
scriptional states by retention of cell markers associated with
transitory stages.
Discussion
Investigations of mechanical unloading during spaceﬂight
in microgravity have demonstrated the maintenance of
‘‘stemness’’ in ESCs, developmental EB spheroids, and
lineage speciﬁc stem cells [22,23,32,33]. In contrast positive
dynamic loading studies have shown that mechanical stimu-
lation induces upregulation of proliferative and specialization
gene pathways via independent molecular mechanisms [5].
Our study demonstrated that a 60-min HG pulse in day 9 EBs
results in limited divergence in cell type assignment and
transcriptomic signature from traditional static culture EBs.
Embryo development studies varying gravity environment in
murine models have shown that stage of gestation when the
gravity disturbance is applied is critical. NASA-NIH.R1,
NASA-NIH.R2 studies assessed rat breeding pairs on-orbit
ﬁnding that on-orbit breeding resulted in no viable pups;
However, there were signs of early stage pregnancies in a
small portion of the females [34].
Conversely, studies of 2 g HG during gestation did not
interfere with mating or gestation [35] but 3 g resulted in no
viable pupping. Another study conducted by Schenker and
Forkheim, on early pregnancy mice found that spaceﬂight
exposure resulted in failed gestation of pre-implantation

HG pulse elicits greater expression of developmental markers but reduces cluster expression exclusivity in favor
of more transitory cell phenotype. (A) UMAP clustering identiﬁes nine clusters for both HG pulse and no-pulse control EBs.
Two clusters identify as extra-embryonic tissues (gray boxes) and seven clusters identify along the three germ layer
developmental program. General cell type locals are indicated for progenitor ESCs, pre- and post-implant epiblasts (pre-I

implant epiblasts and primitive endoderm cells (indicated by hashed arrow). (B) Cluster-speciﬁc expression of develop-

spond with ﬁndings of Lei et al., which found that blastocyte
formation and quality were compromised by spaceﬂight by
mechanisms similar to ground based low dose radiation
[38]. Our investigation established that a pulse of HG
loading increased DNA repair and apoptotic processes.
These studies collectively suggesting a potential gravity

trajectory compared to control, indicating maintained progenitor potency in cells committed to later differentiation states.

regulated DDR pathway that may play a role in regulating
how developmental cells respond to DNA damage, critical
for the cell transition from pre- to post-implantation and
gestation success.
Our single cell study evaluated the transcriptomic

pulse of mechanical loading and demonstrated the load-

in
increased
developmental
progression. Similarly, a recent parabolic ﬂight study
evaluated
repeated
micro-
to
hyper-gravity
periodic
loading [39] ﬁnding ESCs exposed to the 31 parabolas
elicited downregulation of proliferation and cell cycle
genes and upregulation of developmental/differentiation
genes. Additionally, ESCs recovered from the parabolic
gravity loading then cultured as EBs for a further 12 days
showed elevated Gene Ontology/ Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes pathways associated with skeletal,
respiratory, blood vessels, liver, and nervous system and
suppression of cardiac development pathways.
Blaber et al., collected 15 day EBs on-orbit for gene
expression proﬁling, ﬁnding inhibition of terminal germ
layer lineage markers and decrease in mechanotransduc-
tion signaling and membrane spanning proteins [22]. These
data providing further evidence that absence of normal
mechanical loading may restrict developmental potential.
Together these complementary studies provide strong ev-
idence that gravity loading regulates mammalian devel-
opmental processes and stem cell specialization. It is
possible, however, that synergistic effects between me-
chanical unloading during spaceﬂight and space radiation,
as reported by Blaber et al., may also contribute to the
observed effects. Future investigations should address this
potential synergy by combining mechanical loading with
particle accelerator-simulated relevant space radiation do-
ses and dose rates.
Finally, the single cell approach we used also allowed for
mapping of the developmental program in a pseudotime
coordinates system that models and orders temporal rela-
tionships between various gene expression states of cells in
a population. Mapping EB development of the HG and
unstimulated controls show cell populations are susceptible
to ‘‘branching’’ cell fate decisions in response to gravity
loading. Embryogenesis cell fate decisions are highly
choreographed in response to cell–cell, cell–matrix, and
cytokine signaling [40–42]. Because these cell fate decisions
play a decisive role in execution of the developmental
program, single cell may allow for more precise tran-
scriptomic mapping of cell fate decisions based on tran-
scriptomic similarity between cells [43,44].
Utilizing such methods to assess embryogenesis, inves-
tigations have found speciﬁcity of cell lineage tracing such
as primordial germ cell tracing to pre-implant epiblasts [27]
and deﬁnition of mid- to late-PS transitory transcriptomic
signature [28]. Our single cell assessment of HG trajectory
demonstrates that a positive gravity load induces branching
of an inactive pluripotent population of ESC signature
positive cells (Oct4+, Tcf15+, Gbx2+, etc.) with little to no
cell cycle transcriptomic activity (cyclin/CDK complexes
[45]), distinct from the starting ESC cell population. Our
study also visualized branching points for cephalocaudal
folding gene expression and PS signature cells between pre-
and post-implant epiblast transition.
Conclusions
This study offers a novel assessment of how in vitro ESC
maintenance and EB development can be regulated by a
positive pulse of gravity loading at single cell resolution.
Speciﬁcally, we show that a 60-min 50 g/5 kPa HG pulse
resulted in cells during early development maintaining
transitory phenotypes, and having enhanced expression of
germ layer lineage markers. This study further deﬁnes the
power of gravity loading in regulating stem cell self-renewal
and differentiation by identiﬁcation of transcriptomic pat-
terns in stem cells and developmental processes, which can
aid in understanding how gravity can be leveraged to elicit
regenerative responses; beneﬁting in vitro platforms for
organoid tissue culture, and regenerative medicine.
