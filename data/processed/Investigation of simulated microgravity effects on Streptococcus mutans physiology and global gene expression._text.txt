Investigation of simulated microgravity effects on
Streptococcus mutans physiology and global gene expression
Silvia S. Orsini1, April M. Lewis1,2 and Kelly C. Rice1
Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival
inﬂammation in response to space ﬂight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis.
However, the speciﬁc physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space ﬂight and/or ground-
based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated
microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome proﬁles, H2O2 resistance, and
competence in sucrose-containing bioﬁlm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased
killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that
expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high
aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in
carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity
analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic
potential of this organism during space ﬂight missions.

INTRODUCTION
Streptococcus mutans is a primary causative agent of dental caries,
demonstrated by its isolation from carious tooth lesions in
humans,1 its ability to initiate caries in germ-free rodent models
of infection,2 and the established link between high levels of this
bacterium in the
oral cavity
and active
caries.3 Although
preventable by ﬂuoridation of water and various dental proce-
dures,4, caries remains the most common chronic disease among
children, and remains untreated in up to 30% of adults over 35
years-old.5 S. mutans transient bacteremias can also initiate
endocarditis in at-risk patient groups.6 Successful colonization of
the oral cavity and persistence in multi-species dental plaque by S.
mutans is inherently dependent on both its ability to form bioﬁlm
and its rapid metabolism of carbohydrates by the glycolytic
pathway. The low pH that results from accumulation of acidic
metabolic end-products favors the growth of S. mutans and other
acid-tolerant species relative to healthy plaque microﬂora, as well
as the eventual demineralization of tooth enamel and the
development of caries. Adherence of S. mutans to the tooth
surface and subsequent bioﬁlm development are mediated by
several
bacterial
factors,
including
production
of
sucrose-
dependent extracellular glucan polymers by glucosyltransferase
enzymes,7 speciﬁc cell surface adhesins,8, 9 the major autolysin
AtlA,10 the quorum-sensing competence (com) system,11 and
extracellular DNA.12
To protect the health of astronauts during space ﬂight missions,
it is critical to understand the effects of this environment on both
host biology and the host microbiota. Simulated microgravity
exposure has been shown to cause increased mandibular and
alveolar bone loss13 and decreased saliva ﬂow,14 signiﬁcant
predisposing host factors that could contribute to development
of caries and/or periodontal disease. Traditionally, the approach to
maintaining astronaut oral health during space ﬂight missions has
been routed in preventative dentistry, whereby astronauts are
subjected to rigorous preﬂight dental screening and treatment.15
However, in the face of future long-term space ﬂight missions,
research and discovery of new methods for maintaining oral
hygiene and dental health under a microgravity environment are
required.15 Previous studies on the effects of spaceﬂight on the
oral microbiota have primarily focused on culture-dependent
methods of quantifying the numbers of oral bacteria in human
subjects before and after spaceﬂight.16–18 Furthermore, astronauts
have been shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and
increased dental calculus and gingival inﬂammation in response
to space ﬂight.16 However, assessment of the physiology and
virulence potential of oral pathogens such as S. mutans under
controlled microgravity analog conditions has been relatively
lacking. In this respect, rotating wall vessel bioreactors are a
common technology used to grow bacteria under microgravity
analog conditions in ground-based studies. When completely
ﬁlled with media (lacking air bubbles or “head space”) and rotated
on the axis perpendicular to the Earth’s gravitational vector, these
reactors maintain a low-shear environment (<1 dyn/cm2) whereby
gravitational vectors are randomized over the surface of the cells
or particles contained within the vessel.19 As such, this simulated
environment models “weightlessness” by counteracting gravita-
tional forces that would otherwise promote cellular sedimenta-
tion.19,20 The low-shear force experienced in this microgravity
analog system boasts the additional advantage of mimicking the

low-shear force of saliva ﬂow (<0.8 dyn/cm2) experienced by
plaque bacteria in the oral cavity.21 In this study, high-aspect
rotating vessels (HARVs) were therefore used to ascertain the
effects of simulated microgravity on S. mutans gene expression,
physiology, oxidative stress resistance, and competence, using
both culture-dependent and “-omic” (metabolomics and RNA-seq)
approaches.
RESULTS
S. mutans HARV growth curves and cell aggregation
To probe the effect of simulated microgravity growth on S.
mutans, continuous growth curves (whereby cell samples were
removed from the same HARV at different time points) were
performed (n = 3 independent experiments each) in bioﬁlm media
(BM) containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose over a 24 h
period. In this analysis, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in
CFU/ml at each time point were observed (Supplemental Fig. S1).
An initial decrease in CFU/ml was observed in both the simulated
microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures between t = 0
(time of inoculation) and t = 2 h growth, which was likely a
function of sucrose-dependent cell aggregation. Very small
differences in cell viability patterns in early stationary phase
(6–8 h growth) suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV
culture may have entered stationary phase slightly sooner than
the normal gravity HARV culture in this experiment. As well, the
simulated microgravity culture persisted in stationary phase until
approximately 12 h growth, followed by a somewhat rapid death
phase, with a 1-log loss of viability between 12 and 24 h growth. In
contrast, the viability of normal gravity culture underwent a more
gradual decrease in cell viability between 12 and 24 h of growth.
Monitoring of cell growth by CFU/ml in the continuous growth
curve experiments described above required constant disruption
of the HARV cultures, making it difﬁcult to assess potential
macroscopic differences in cell aggregation in the simulated
microgravity and normal gravity conditions. Therefore, these
growth
curves
were
also
performed
using
an
“end-point”
approach, whereby simulated microgravity and normal gravity
HARV cultures (n = 2 independent experiments per time point per
growth condition) were grown undisturbed in replicate HARV
vessels for t = 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h (Fig. 1). Using this end-point
approach, no signiﬁcant differences in CFU/ml were observed
between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV
cultures at the assessed time points (Fig. 1), and the initial drop in
CFU/ml observed early in the growth curves of the continuous
cultures (Supplemental Fig. S1) was not observed in these
end-point cultures. As well, both the simulated microgravity and
normal gravity cultures underwent the same pattern of growth
when monitored with this end-point approach: Log phase growth
occurred between 0 and 6 h, and both cultures were in early
stationary phase at 8 h growth, followed by entry into late
stationary phase/death phase between 24 and 48 h growth.
Interestingly, differences in macroscopic cell aggregation were
consistently observed between the simulated microgravity and
normal gravity HARV conditions when using the end-point growth
analysis. Speciﬁcally, the simulated microgravity condition tended

aggregates in the normal gravity growth condition tended to form
less compact structures (Fig. 2).
Metabolomics analysis of “end-point” HARV cultures
To monitor potential differences in the metabolome of simulated
microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, cell pellets and
culture supernatants were harvested from a second end-point
HARV culture experiment (n = 3 independent experiments per
time point per growth condition) at t = 4, t = 8, and t = 24 h
samples, corresponding to log-phase, early stationary phase, and
late stationary/death phase, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S2).
Given that macroscopic
differences in the self-aggregating
clusters of S. mutans cells were consistently observed at the t =
8 h time point (Fig. 2), RNA-seq analysis was also performed on the
t = 8 h samples. Principle component analysis (PCA) of metabo-
lomics data generated from t = 4, 8, and 24 h HARV cultures
(Supplemental Files S2 and S3) revealed a strong relationship
between the time of growth (t = 4, 8, and 24 h) and metabolite
proﬁle for each of the simulated microgravity and normal gravity
cultures (Fig. 3). However, a much weaker “time-treatment”
relationship existed when comparing the metabolite proﬁle
between simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity cultures at
each time point. Welch’s two sample t tests revealed 8, 14, and
10 statistically signiﬁcant differences (p ≤0.05) in cellular meta-
bolite production between cells grown under normal gravity and
microgravity conditions at the 4, 8, and 24 h time points,
respectively
(Supplemental
File
S2).
Likewise,
21,
21,
and
23 statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed between
the corresponding culture supernatant samples at these time
points (Supplemental File S3). Keeping in mind the caveat that the
number of signiﬁcant differences at each time point were close to
that expected by random chance alone (5% error rate), the
signiﬁcant changes of cell-associated and supernatant metabolites
of the 8 h HARV cultures are summarized in Table 1, and their
potential relationship to the corresponding 8 h RNA-seq data are
discussed below.

RNA-seq analysis
Because macroscopic structural differences between the S. mutans
simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were
consistently observed at 8 h growth (early stationary phase), we
chose
to
perform
RNA-seq
analysis
on
n = 3
independent
biological samples per growth condition (simulated microgravity
and normal gravity) isolated from this time point. Compared to
the metabolomics data, differential expression analysis of the 8 h
RNA-seq data revealed a large number of statistically signiﬁcant
gene expression changes in normal gravity relative to simulated
microgravity growth (Supplemental File S4). Speciﬁcally, 94 genes
were up-regulated (log2 fold-change ≥1.0) and 153 genes were
down-regulated (log2 fold-change ≤−1.0) in normal gravity
cultures relative to simulated microgravity cultures. These patterns
in gene expression were conﬁrmed by qPCR for a subset of genes
(Supplemental Table S1). Functional classiﬁcation (Fig. 4) revealed
that expression of a large number of genes associated with
transposon
sequences,
as
well
as
several
genes
encoding
predicted phage proteins, were down-regulated in normal gravity
cultures relative to simulated microgravity growth. A second trend
of interest was the signiﬁcant down-regulated expression of genes
involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including various phospho-
transferase (PTS) systems, the carbon catabolite protein regulator
ccpA, and the redox sensitive transcriptional regulator rex, in the 8
h normal gravity cultures relative to the simulated microgravity
cultures (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4). Increased expression of
genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs and other aspects of
protein translation was also observed in the normal gravity
cultures compared to simulated microgravity growth, whereas
expression of a large number of genes encoding transcriptional
regulators was decreased in the normal gravity cultures (Fig. 4). As
well, altered expression of stress genes was also observed in the
normal gravity HARV cultures, including decreased expression of
the toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems mazEF (SMU_172/173) and relBE
(SMU_895/896), decreased expression of the holin-like lrgA,
decreased expression of the peroxide resistance gene dpr, and
increased expression of genes encoding glutathione S-transferase
(SMU_1296) and glutaredoxin (SMU_669c) (Fig. 4).
DAVID bioinformatics resource22, 23 was used to further probe
the RNA-seq dataset for functional annotation groups that were
enriched in the genes that displayed a log2 fold change
expression of at least ±1.0 in the normal gravity vs. simulated
microgravity HARV cultures (Supplemental Table S2). This analysis
revealed the presence of four signiﬁcant (enrichment scores ≥1.3)
functional annotation clusters in the down-regulated normal
gravity genes, which included genes involved in carbohydrate
metabolism and transport (cluster I), transcriptional regulators
(clusters II and III), and carbohydrate transporters/other membrane
proteins (cluster IV). As well, functional annotation clusters
involved in arginine metabolism (cluster V) and nucleoside/tRNA
metabolism (cluster VI) were signiﬁcantly enriched (enrichment
scores ≥1.3) in the up-regulated normal gravity genes. To identify
metabolic pathways potentially altered under the simulated
microgravity growth condition, all statistically-signiﬁcant changes
in 8 h growth gene expression from the RNA-seq differential
expression analysis with a minimum log2 fold-change of at least
±0.6 were also analyzed using the bioinformatics program
Metacyc.24. The top metabolic pathways identiﬁed by this analysis
were mixed acid fermentation (seven genes), arginine biosynth-
esis (six genes), and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis
(ﬁve genes) (Supplemental Fig. S3). Speciﬁcally, genes involved in
the conversion of acetyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate (a TCA cycle
intermediate), arginine biosynthesis, and dCDP/dTMP biosynthesis
were upregulated in the normal gravity HARV cultures, whereas
genes involved in ethanol and acetate fermentation were down-
regulated in normal gravity HARV cultures. Interestingly, when
comparing these metabolic pathways to statistically-signiﬁcant
changes in cellular metabolites at 8 h growth (Table 1), several
matched to the corresponding metabolic pathway changes
(Supplemental Fig. S3) identiﬁed in the RNA-seq data by Metacyc,
including 2-oxogluarate (alpha-ketoglutarate; mixed acid fermen-
tation), pyruvate (mixed acid fermentation), argininosuccinate
(arginine biosynthesis), uridine monophosphate and uracil (pyr-
midine deoxynucleotide de novo biosynthesis). The apparent
increased sensitivity of the RNA-seq data in detecting more
changes in S. mutans metabolism relative to the corresponding
metabolomics data may reﬂect a suboptimal component of the
metabolomics sample collection method and/or processing time.
Assessment of oxidative stress and competence phenotypes
S. mutans encounters signiﬁcant oxidative stress in the oral cavity
in the form of H2O2 production by competing non-cariogenic oral
streptococci,25,26 as well as from dental care products (tooth-
pastes, mouthwash) that contain H2O2. Furthermore, expression of
several
oxidative
stress-related
genes
(dpr,
rex,
SMU_1296,
SMU_669c) was altered in the 8 h simulated microgravity HARV
cultures. Therefore, the ability of S. mutans to survive exogenous
H2O2 treatment was compared in cells isolated from exponential
(t = 4), early-stationary (t = 8) and late stationary (t = 16) simulated
microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig. 5). Although

no signiﬁcant differences in oxidative stress resistance were
observed between normal gravity and simulated microgravity
cells isolated from 4 and 8 h growth, the H2O2-treated 4 h cells
(Fig. 5a) displayed a greater overall loss of viability (~1% survival
after 90 min of treatment) compared to the 8 h cells (Fig. 5b; ~50%
survival after 90 min of treatment). Interestingly, when this
experiment was repeated on cells from normal gravity and
simulated microgravity cultures harvested at 16 h growth (Fig. 5c),
the simulated microgravity cells displayed signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05,
one-tailed T test) increased H2O2 killing (~22% survival after 60
min treatment) compared to the normal gravity cells (~43%
survival after 60 min treatment).
Because previous S. mutans studies have implicated a complex
link between oxidative stress, bioﬁlm formation, and natural
competence [reviewed in27], we were curious if competence was
also subject to regulation by the low-shear modeled microgravity
(LSMMG) environment. Therefore early-exponential phase (growth
phase at which S. mutans is most competent during standard
in vitro growth) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV
cultures were tested for their ability to uptake plasmid DNA.
However, transformation efﬁciency (as measured by uptake of a
plasmid conferring erythromycin resistance) was nearly identical
between simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures
(Fig. 6). The transformation efﬁciency was also not affected by
HARV growth itself, as the HARV transformation efﬁciencies were
similar to those measured in a parallel non-rotating culture of S.
mutans (Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
Although the effects of both spaceﬂight and microgravity analog
growth on virulence-related phenotypes of bacterial pathogens
such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus have been
well-described,28–38 comparatively little research has been dedi-
cated to studying the speciﬁc effects of space ﬂight and simulated
microgravity on virulence attributes of oral bacteria such as S.
mutans. In the Skylab missions conducted in the 1970s, the effects

of space ﬂight and diet on the oral cavity and oral microbiota of
astronauts were documented using culture-dependent methods.
These studies demonstrated that increased counts of speciﬁc oral
bacteria (i.e. Bacteriodes, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, S.
sanguinus, and S. mutans) were recovered from the astronauts in
response to space ﬂight.16 Furthermore, the astronauts in these
studies exhibited decreased salivary lysozyme and increased
dental calculus and gingival inﬂammation.16 More recently, the
effect of simulated microgravity on the physiology and bioﬁlm
structure of S. mutans was also assessed using a superconducting
magnet capable of generating a large gradient high magnetic
ﬁeld (LG-HMF),39 which mimics the space-like gravity environment
by achieving stable levitation of diamagnetic materials such as
biological cells and tissues.40 The results of this study suggested
that growth of S. mutans under simulated microgravity enhanced
its acid tolerance, altered its bioﬁlm architecture, and increased its
proportion
within
dual-species
bioﬁlms
co-cultured
with
S.
sanguinis, an H2O2-producing early colonizer of dental plaque
bioﬁlm.39 Collectively, these previous studies suggest that both
space ﬂight and the microgravity analog environment have the
ability to alter the cariogenic potential of S. mutans.
In our current work, HARVs rotated on an axis perpendicular to
the Earth’s gravitational vector were used to simulate a low-shear
modeled

environment.
This
ground-based model of microgravity has been used to study
the response of a variety of microorganisms to “weightlessness”
that would be encountered during space ﬂight [reviewed in19, 41,
42]. However, it is important to keep in mind that the S. mutans
LSMMG-associated metabolic and physiological changes (i.e.
alterations in cell aggregation, transcriptome, and sensitivity to
oxidative stress) presented here could represent the bacteria’s
response to either simulated microgravity and/or low-ﬂuid shear
(<1 dyn/cm2) speciﬁc environmental signals, the latter of which
may be relevant to the ﬂuid shear of saliva ﬂow (<0.8 dyn/cm2)
experienced by S. mutans in the oral cavity.19,21 Therefore, the
data obtained in this study have the potential to shed light on S.
mutans physiology and virulence properties relevant to environ-
mental signals experienced in the host, and will hopefully provide
a springboard for planning future space ﬂight studies of oral
bacteria. It is also important to note that all of the S. mutans
experiments presented in this study were conducted in semi-
deﬁned culture medium containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM
sucrose, previously shown to promote in vitro S. mutans bioﬁlm
formation.43 The addition of sucrose, a host dietary sugar to which
S. mutans is exposed to in the oral cavity, promotes production of
extracellular glucan polymers by S. mutans, important bioﬁlm
matrix components that promote intracellular adhesion.7 In reality,
the in vivo plaque bioﬁlm environment of S. mutans is much more
complex, including stress conditions such as interspecies competi-
tion for nutrients and space within the bioﬁlm, as well as
alternating periods of “feast and famine” with respect to dietary
carbohydrate consumption. Therefore, the growth condition used
in this study should be considered a simple representation of
caries-promoting “feast” conditions experienced by S. mutans in
the oral cavity. With these caveats in mind, the following
discussion points represent interesting patterns/conclusions from
the data obtained in this study:
1.
S.
mutans
displays
an
altered
early
stationary-phase
metabolism under simulated microgravity conditions: As indicated
in the “Results” section and Fig. 1, S. mutans “end-point” simulated
microgravity
and
normal
gravity
cultures
appear
to
enter
stationary phase at the same point in growth (6 h) compared to
normal gravity cultures, and there were no apparent differences in
CFU/ml of each culture at each time point. This being said, the 8 h
(early stationary phase) metabolomics and RNA-seq data suggest
that S. mutans simulated microgravity metabolism at this point is
altered relative to normal gravity growth. For example, simulated
microgravity
cultures
experienced
a
ten-fold
decrease
in
supernatant glucose levels (Table 1 and Supplemental File S3) at
8 h growth relative to the normal gravity cultures. Furthermore,
expression
of
PTS
system
genes
involved
in transport
of
carbohydrates (glucose, mannitol, trehalose, mannose and cello-
biose) was signiﬁcantly upregulated during simulated micrograv-
ity growth, whereas expression of genes encoding ribosomal
proteins, tRNAs, and other aspects of protein translation was
decreased in the microgravity cultures at this time point (Fig. 4
and Supplemental File S4 ). Bioinformatics analysis also revealed
patterns
of
decreased
arginine
metabolism
and
decreased
pyrimidine biosynthesis (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemen-
tal Fig. S3) in the 8 h simulated microgravity cultures. Finally,
expression of genes encoding the central metabolic transcrip-
tional regulators CcpA and Rex were also both upregulated (2.2-
fold and 2.8-fold, respectively) at 8 h growth in the simulated
microgravity cultures. CcpA has been shown to regulate S. mutans
catabolite repression and the ability to utilize non-preferred
carbohydrates, acid tolerance, acid production, and bioﬁlm
formation,44–46 whereas Rex regulates expression of S. mutans
genes involved with carbohydrate fermentation, bioﬁlm forma-
tion, and oxidative stress resistance in response to cellular
redox.47,48 Interestingly, a role for Rex in the transcriptional
response of Staphylococcus aureus to LSMMG was also previously
implicated by the altered expression of a number of Rex-regulated
genes under this growth condition.29 Although great care was
taken in each experiment to vigorously vortex all samples prior to
and during serial dilution plating, we cannot exclude the
possibility that sucrose-dependent cell clumping may have
masked more apparent growth differences between the simulated
microgravity and normal gravity end-point HARV cultures in these
studies.
2. S. mutans late stationary-phase simulated microgravity
cultures appear to be subject to increased stress: A striking
phenotypic property observed in S. mutans simulated microgravity
cultures was the greatly increased sensitivity of cells from late
stationary phase (16 h) to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5c) relative to cells
from normal gravity cultures. However, no apparent differences in
oxidative stress resistance were observed between the simulated
microgravity and normal gravity cells harvested at earlier time
points (log phase and early stationary phase, Fig.
5a, b,
respectively). This result correlated with the LG-HMF S. mutans
microgravity study by Cheng and co-workers,39 which found that
mid-exponential phase S. mutans microgravity and normal gravity
cells did not differ in their sensitivity to H2O2. In previous studies,
late stationary-phase (20–24 h) cultures of S. typhimurium and P.
aeruginosa were both shown to be more resistant to oxidative
stress when grown in simulated microgravity,30,49 whereas S.
typhimurium simulated microgravity cultures grown to an earlier
phase of growth (10 h) displayed increased sensitivity to H2O2
treatment.31 Furthermore, the sensitivity of stationary phase
simulated microgravity cultures of adherent-invasive E. coli to
oxidative stress was shown to be strain-dependent.33 The
susceptibility of S. aureus to oxidative stress when grown in
LSMMG has also been previously investigated: compared to
normal gravity growth, S. aureus cells isolated from simulated
microgravity cultures displayed increased sensitivity to challenge
with H2O2, which was demonstrated to be related to decreased
carotenoid (yellow membrane pigment) production under this
growth condition.29 These previously-published studies, in con-
junction with the S. mutans results presented here, clearly
demonstrate that the microgravity model used, growth phase at
which oxidative stress is tested, and/or other inherent species and
strain-dependent differences, make it difﬁcult to discern broad
conclusions regarding the effect of the LSMMG on oxidative stress
resistance.
Although direct comparisons cannot be extrapolated due to
time point differences between the 8 h RNA-seq data (Fig. 4 and
Supplemental File S4) and 16 h oxidative stress data (Fig. 5c), it is

interesting to note that the 8 h simulated microgravity cultures
displayed increased expression of genes previously-shown to be
involved in the response to oxidative stress in S. mutans. These
included lrgA, which encodes a predicted holin-like protein,50,51
dpr, encoding an iron-binding protein that reduces the intracel-
lular free iron pool during oxidative stress,52,53 and rex.48 As well, S.
mutans
simulated
microgravity
cultures
displayed
increased
expression
of
genes
encoding
phosphotransacetylase
(Pta;
SMU_1043c) and two putative acetate kinase (Act) genes (ackA
and SMU_1299c), involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to
acetyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate to acetate, respectively.54
In S. mutans, aspects of the Pta-Ack pathway have been shown to
inﬂuence the cellular response to oxidative stress resistance.54
These results suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV
cultures may be experiencing an oxidative-like stress response in
early stationary phase (8 h growth), and the altered expression of
these oxidative-stress related genes and metabolic pathways is
perhaps occurring in response to this stress. Further support for
the idea that the S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures may
be experiencing more inherent stress relative to the normal
gravity cultures stems from the observation that TA system genes
mazEF and relBE were signiﬁcantly upregulated during simulated
microgravity growth (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4). MazF and
RelE have been shown in several bacteria to selectively inhibit
translation by cleaving speciﬁc mRNA recognition sequences in
response to nutritional stress [reviewed in55,56]. These data
collectively suggest that S. mutans simulated microgravity HARV
cultures display characteristics associated with stationary phase
cellular stress. However, it is not clear from this data whether these
cultures are experiencing overlapping simultaneous stresses (such
as oxidative and starvation stress), or if the sum of these
phenotype and gene expression changes represent a stress
response speciﬁc to LSMMG.
3. S. mutans displays an altered cell aggregation phenotype
under simulated microgravity conditions: Micro-organisms such as
Micrococcus luteus,57 E. coli,58 P. aeruginosa,34,35,59 S. aureus,29 S.
typhimurium,36 and Candida albicans60,61 have all displayed
increased bioﬁlm growth when grown in either ground-based
simulated and/or space ﬂight microgravity conditions. In some
instances, this bioﬁlm increase was paralleled by documented
increases in expression of bioﬁlm-promoting regulatory genes or
adhesion factors.29,34–36,49,58,61 Given these observations in other
micro-organisms, we predicted that S. mutans would also display
an increase in bioﬁlm formation when grown in HARV micro-
gravity cultures. Although bioﬁlms attached to a solid surface were
not assessed in these studies, macroscopic differences in cell–cell
aggregation were typically observed in simulated microgravity
compared to normal gravity HARV cultures at stationary phase (8 h
growth; Fig. 2), suggesting that cell–cell adhesion and/or bioﬁlm-
like properties of this bacterium were altered in response to
simulated microgravity growth. Although cell aggregation was
observed in both the normal gravity and simulated microgravity
HARV cultures grown in bioﬁlm-promoting media containing
sucrose, the simulated microgravity cell aggregates were more
compact and more difﬁcult to disrupt relative to the aggregates
formed during normal gravity growth. Follow-up studies will be
required to better characterize the structural properties of these
cell aggregates (i.e. production of sucrose-dependent exopoly-
saccharide) and whether they are actually similar to bioﬁlms that
form on hydroxyapatite in vitro and/or the tooth surface in vivo.
However, it is noteworthy that altered cell aggregation and/or
“attachment-independent” phenotypes have also been observed
in other bioﬁlm-forming microbes in both LSMMG29,34 and during
spaceﬂight.61
In summary, the results from our experiments suggest that S.
mutans undergoes changes in metabolism, physiology, and global
gene expression during stationary-phase simulated microgravity
growth
that
impact
cell
aggregation
and
oxidative
stress
resistance. Deﬁning the exact regulatory circuits and contributions
of these differentially regulated genes to the ability of S. mutans to
survive and adapt to LSMMG and spaceﬂight environments will
help in the development of treatment and control strategies to
combat the caries potential of this pathogen. Furthermore, these
studies may provide insight into the response of S. mutans to low-
ﬂuid shear encountered in the oral cavity. Our future research
efforts will focus on assessing S. mutans bioﬁlm formation during
simulated microgravity growth using culture conditions more
closely mimicking the oral cavity (i.e., artiﬁcial saliva media and
periodic pulsing of sucrose addition), as well as growth of S.
mutans as part of a mixed-species bioﬁlm consortium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strain and growth conditions
S. mutans UA15962 was used for all of the experiments described below. All
S. mutans cultures (including HARV vessels) were grown at 37 °C in a 5%
CO2 incubator. For each experiment, S. mutans was freshly streaked from a
frozen 30% (vol vol−1) glycerol stock onto Brain heart infusion (BHI) agar
and grown for 48 h. A single colony was then inoculated into 30 ml BHI
broth, and grown as a static culture for 16–18 h prior to inoculation of
HARVs. Disposable vessel rotary cell culture systems (Synthecon) with
vertical and horizontal 4-station rotator bases were used to simulate
microgravity (HARV rotated on axis perpendicular to gravitational vector)
and “normal” (1 × g) gravity (HARV rotated on axis parallel to gravitational
vector), respectively (Supplemental Figure S4). All HARV manipulations
were performed under a Class II A2 biosafety cabinet (Labconco). HARV
vessels were ﬁlled with sterile media according to manufacturer’s
recommendations, and incubated at room temperature for 18 h prior to
each experiment. This media was then aseptically removed, and 20× dilute
S. mutans overnight culture (approximate OD600 = 0.06/ml) in room-
temperature semi-deﬁned bioﬁlm media (BM)43 containing 11 mM glucose
and 10 mM sucrose, was used to ﬁll each HARV. Prior to HARV rotation and
incubation, sterile 5-ml luer lock syringes were used to remove air bubbles
according to manufacturer’s protocols.
Continuous HARV growth curves
For
each
experiment
(n = 3
independent
experiments
per
growth
condition), overnight S. mutans cultures were used to inoculate 120 ml
of sterile BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose. This inoculum
was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml withdrawn to
measure the time-of-inoculation (t = 0) CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum
volume was then subjected again to vigorous swirling and vortexing and
immediately used to ﬁll 2 × 50 ml disposable HARVs as described above.
Each HARV was rotated either vertically (“simulated microgravity”) or
horizontally (“normal gravity”) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. HARVs were
rotated at 30 RPM for the ﬁrst 8 h of growth, and the rotation speed of
each reactor was increased to 32 RPM after 8 h of growth to ensure that S.
mutans cell aggregates did not settle to the bottom of the simulated
microgravity HARV. At 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postinoculation, each HARV
was removed from the incubator, vigorously agitated to remove adherent
cell clumps from the walls and membrane of the HARV reactor and evenly
dispersing cell clumps, and 1 ml culture was immediately removed for
CFU/ml assessment. The same volume of sterile media was then added
back to each HARV and air bubbles removed as described above prior to
re-initiation of simulated microgravity or normal gravity HARV growth. For
CFU/ml quantiﬁcation, each 1 ml sample was vortexed vigorously for at
least 30 s to resuspend cell clumps, followed immediately by serial dilution
(each tube vortexed vigorously for at least 15 s between each dilution) and
CFU/ml determination using the track plating method.63
HARV “end-point” growth curves
Overnight S. mutans cultures were used to inoculate 500 ml sterile BM
containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose to an approximate OD600 =
0.06/ml as described above. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous
swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml was withdrawn to measure the t = 0
OD600, pH, and CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then
immediately used to ﬁll 8 × 50 ml disposable HARVs (inoculum volume was
subjected to vigorous swirling and vortexing before addition to each
HARV). For end-point growth curve analysis at t = 4, 6, 8, and 12 h (n = 2
independent experiments total per time point per growth condition), four

simulated microgravity and four normal gravity HARV cultures were grown
in parallel at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HARVs were rotated at 30 RPM for the ﬁrst 8 h
of growth, and the rotation speed of each reactor was increased to 32 RPM
after 8 h of growth to ensure that S. mutans cell aggregates did not settle
to the bottom of the simulated microgravity cultures. At each time point,
one simulated microgravity and one normal gravity HARV were each
harvested as follows: 25 ml of HARV culture was transferred to a sterile 50 ml
Falcon tube. The HARV was then closed and shaken vigorously for
approximately 5 s (until there were no remaining visible clumps of bacteria
stuck to the inside walls and membrane of the HARV). The reactor was then
immediately uncapped and the remaining culture transferred to the 50 ml
Falcon tube, which was vortexed at high speed for 30 s prior to removing
100 µl for CFU counts. The tube was vortexed again for 10 s, and 900 µl
immediately removed for measuring OD600 and pH readings. OD600
readings were obtained using a Genesys 10 Bio spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc), culture pH measured with colorpHast indicator strips
(EMD), and CFU/ml calculated by serial dilution plating as described above.
For the end-point growth curve analysis at t = 24 and t = 48 h, a separate
experiment (n = 2 biological replicates for each time point) was performed
as described above.
HARV end-point growth for metabolomic and RNA-seq analyses
Overnight S. mutans cultures were used to inoculate 350 ml sterile BM
containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose to an approximate OD600 =
0.06/ml as described above. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous
swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml was withdrawn to measure the t = 0
OD600, pH, and CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then
immediately used to ﬁll 6 × 50 ml disposable HARVs (inoculum volume was
subjected to vigorous swirling and vortexing before addition to each
HARV). A sterile media control was also collected at the beginning of each
experiment and stored at −80 °C for metabolomics analysis (see below).
For each
experiment
(n = 3
independent
experiments
total),
three
simulated microgravity and three normal gravity HARV cultures were
grown in parallel at 37 °C, 5% CO2 as described above for the end-point
growth curve analysis. For each experiment, one simulated microgravity
and one normal gravity HARV were each harvested at t = 4, t = 8 h, and t =
24 h growth, as described above for the end-point growth curve analysis
(for a total of n = 3 independent samples per time point per growth
condition). HARVs were photographed prior to culture disruption and
harvest to document macroscopic growth observations. After harvesting,
34 ml of each t = 4, 8, and 24 h HARV culture was centrifuged at 3000 RPM,
4 °C for 20 min and immediately placed on ice. 1 ml of culture supernatant
was removed from each centrifuged sample, transferred to 1.5 ml tubes,
and immediately frozen at −80 °C. The remaining culture supernatants
were decanted and cell pellets immediately frozen at −80 °C. For RNA-seq
samples (t = 8 h only), a 10-ml aliquot of each HARV culture was also
centrifuged at 3000 RPM, 4 °C for 20 min and immediately placed on ice.
Culture supernatants were decanted and 1 ml RNAlater (Ambion) was
added to each cell pellet prior to immediate storage at −80 °C.
Metabolite extraction and metabolomics analysis
Extraction of metabolites (n = 3 independent biological samples per time
point and growth condition) and all metabolomics analyses (including
statistics) were performed by Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) following
previously-published methods.64–68 Details speciﬁc to this experiment can
be found in Supplemental File S1 (Supplemental Materials and Methods).
RNA isolation and RNA-seq analysis
RNA was isolated from t = 8 h cell pellets stored at −80 °C in RNAlater
(collected from n = 3 independent experiments each for simulated
microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures) with the RNeasy Kit
(Qiagen) and FASTPREP lysing matrix B tubes (MP Biomedical) using
previously-described methods.50,69 Each RNA sample was then subjected
to a second DNAse treatment using the TURBO DNA-free™Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) per the manufacturer’s protocols. Lack of contaminating
genomic DNA in each RNA sample was then determined using quantitative
real-time PCR (i.e. no cDNA synthesis step) and S. mutans-speciﬁc primers
(1547-F/R; Supplemental Table S3) prior to sending ≥5 µg of each RNA
sample to Seqwright Genomic Services (Houston, TX), who performed all
steps of the RNA-seq workﬂow, data curation, differential expression, and
corresponding statistical analysis. In brief, each RNA sample was subjected
to an mRNA enrichment step and generation of a library of cDNA template
molecules of known strand origin using the TruSeq Total mRNA Sample
Preparation Kit (Illumina). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina
HiSeq 2500 platform, generating 2 × 100 bp read lengths for a total of 2 ×
10 M reads per sample. Illumina CASAVA software was used to create
genomic builds and count reads, whereas TopHat-2.0.8b and Cufﬂinks-
2.0.170 were used to align reads to the S. mutans UA159 genome (Genbank
accession # NC_004350.2). All RNA-seq data have been deposited to NCBI's
Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series
accession number GSE90166.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) assay
For each experiment (n = 3 independent biological samples each for
simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures), two S. mutans
10-ml HARV cultures were inoculated as described above, and each was
grown for either 4, 8, or 16 h. For the 4 and 8 h experiments, the HARV
rotation speed was 30 RPM. For the 16 h experiment, the HARV rotation
speed was 30 RPM for the ﬁrst 8 h of growth, and was then increased to 35
RPM to counteract sedimentation of cellular aggregates. S. mutans cultures
were then harvested from each HARV vessel, transferred to a 50 ml Falcon
tube, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 RPM. Cell pellets were
resuspended in 5 ml sterile 1× Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS), and
100 µl was withdrawn from each tube and subjected to serial dilution
plating as described above to enumerate CFU/ml of each cell suspension
at “t = 0” (prior to H2O2 addition). H2O2 was added to each remaining 4.9
ml cell suspension to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM, and incubated at 37 °C,
5% CO2. Samples of each cell suspension were removed at 15, 30, 45, 60,
and 120 min post-H2O2 addition to enumerate CFU/ml, and % survival for
each sample was calculated by 100× (t = × CFU/ml/t = 0 CFU/ml).
Competence assay
The ability of S. mutans to take up exogenous DNA was assessed in
microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures based on previously-
described methods.50,71 For each experiment (n = 3 independent biological
samples each for simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV
cultures), S. mutans 10-ml micro-gravity and normal gravity HARV cultures
were grown in BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose for 90
min [corresponding to 2.3 × 106 CFU/ml (±3.0 × 105 SEM) for normal gravity
and 3.1 × 106 CFU/ml (±1.5 × 105 SEM) for simulated microgravity] at 30
RPM. HARVS were removed from rotator bases and 2 µg of unmethylated
pOri23 plasmid DNA was added to each reactor. Microgravity and normal
gravity HARVs were then incubated for 2.5 h at 30 RPM prior to serial
dilution and plating of each culture on BHI agar ±10 µg/ml erythromycin
(Erm; selectable antibiotic for pOri23). CFU/ml were determined after 48 h
plate growth, and transformation efﬁciencies were calculated as the
percentage of transformants (BHI-Erm10 CFU/ml) among the total viable
cells (BHI CFU/ml). For each experiment, a non-rotating control culture (15-
ml Falcon tube containing 15 ml of S. mutans culture) was grown in parallel
and assessed for competence as described above.
Bioinformatics
The DAVID Bioinformatics Resource22,23 was used to aid in functional
categorization of the RNA-seq differential expression data and to perform
functional annotation clustering. Only genes with statistically-signiﬁcant
log2-fold changes of at least ±1.0 were included in these analyses.
The lowest classiﬁcation stringency was used for functional categorization.
For
functional
annotation
clustering
analysis,
the
default
analysis
parameters were used: Medium classiﬁcation stringency, similarity thresh-
old = 0.5, enrichment threshold (EASE score) = 1.0. As recommended
previously,22 an enrichment score cutoff of ≥1.3 was applied to the
functional
annotation clustering
analysis. For
identifying trends
in
metabolic pathway changes, all statistically-signiﬁcant RNA-seq differential
expression data with a log2-fold change of at least ±0.6 were also analyzed
using Metacyc.24
Statistics
For metabolomics, statistical analyses were performed in ArrayStudio on
log transformed data. For those analyses not standard in ArrayStudio, the
programs R (http://cran.r-project.org/) or JMP (SAS, http://www.jmp.com)
were used as previously described.72 Two-way ANOVA was used to
compare the effects of treatment (simulated microgravity vs. normal
gravity growth) and growth time (t = 4, 8, and 24 h) on metabolite
differences. Multiple comparisons were accounted for with the false
discovery rate (FDR) method, and each FDR was estimated by q-values.

PCA was also applied to the metabolomics data. For RNA-seq, differential
expression analysis was performed by Seqwright Genomic Services using
FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads) values and fold-
change was expressed as log2 (FPKM normal gravity/FPKM simulated
microgravity). For all other data, statistical analyses were performed using
Sigmaplot version 12.5 (Build 12.5.0.38, Systat Software, Inc.). Data was
tested for normality and equal variance, followed by a T-test or Rank-sum
test, as appropriate.
