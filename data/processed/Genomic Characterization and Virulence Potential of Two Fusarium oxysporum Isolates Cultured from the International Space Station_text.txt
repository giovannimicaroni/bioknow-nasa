ABSTRACT
Two isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, ISS-F3 and ISS-F4, were cultured
from the dining table on the International Space Station (ISS). Genomic analyses us-
ing EF-1 sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and
single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically dif-
ferent from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4
had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant-
pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate
(FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may pro-
duce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis
showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay
using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed
that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, in-
cluding humans. However, its effects on the health of immunocompromised humans
warrant further study.
IMPORTANCE This is the ﬁrst study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates
from a built environment, as well as one that has been exposed to space. The char-
acterization and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for
the medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew
who coinhabit the ISS with these strains.
KEYWORDS Fusarium, International Space Station, fungi, genomics
F
usarium oxysporum is a presumed asexual, ﬁlamentous fungus ubiquitous in soil and
infamous for causing vascular wilt and root rot disease in many economically
important plants and crops (1). While the number of hosts this species can infect is
extensive (tomatoes, bananas, cotton, strawberries, eggplants, tulips, soybean, beets, and
chrysanthemum, to name only a few) (2), individual isolates show a high degree of host
speciﬁcity and are assigned to formae speciales (f. sp.) based on the host it can infect (3). For
example, F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense causes fungal wilt in bananas (“Panama disease”) while
f. sp. melonis, f. sp. tulipae, and f. sp. cucumerimum infect and cause disease in melons, tulips,
and cucumbers, respectively. At present, there are approximately 150 formae speciales (i.e.,
host-speciﬁc groups of strains) that have been described (2).
While well known as a phytopathogen, F. oxysporum can also cause infections in
humans, ranging from superﬁcial and localized (skin, nail, cornea, and superﬁcial
wound) in immunocompetent individuals to invasive and disseminated (blood culture,

deep tissue involvement, or isolation of strain from two or more body sites) in
immunocompromised patients (4–6). Since members of the fungal genus Fusarium are
intrinsically resistant to most available antifungals on the market (7), prognosis is often
poor and sometimes fatal for those afﬂicted with systemic fusariosis (6, 8).
Fungi are known to produce many bioactive molecules that can beneﬁt humans,
such as antimicrobials, antialgals, immunosuppressants, compounds cytotoxic to can-
cer cells, insecticides, and antioxidants (9–11), and F. oxysporum is no exception. F.
oxysporum isolated from the plants Smallanthus sonchifolius and Catharanthus roseus
were shown to produce, in appreciable amounts, the anticancer drugs anhydrofusaru-
bin and beauvericin (12) and vinblastine and vincristine (13), respectively. An isolate of
F. oxysporum cultured from Juniperus recurva was shown to produce the aryltetralin
lignin podophyllotoxin (14), which is a precursor for the chemical synthesis of antican-
cer drugs like etoposide, teniposide, and etopophose (15, 16). Podophyllotoxin is also
known for its antiviral (17) and antiparasitic (18) activity.
In an ongoing microbial tracking study of the International Space Station (ISS), two
F. oxysporum isolates were cultured from the dining table in the U.S. module of the ISS.
The genomes of these two isolates were sequenced and compared to 65 other F.
oxysporum isolates. The predicted proteins were annotated and mined for the presence
of secondary metabolites and putative virulence factors. The virulence of these isolates
in an immunocompromised (MAPKK-deﬁcient) Caenorhabditis elegans model of inva-
sive fusariosis was also assessed. This is the ﬁrst study to isolate and characterize F.
oxysporum isolates from a built environment as well as one that has been exposed to
space.
RESULTS
Two F. oxysporum isolates (designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4) were cultured from the
dining table of the U.S. module of the ISS. The genomes were paired-end sequenced
(2  100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size, resulting in 48
million (ISS-F3) and 42 million (ISS-F4) reads. These paired-end reads were de novo
assembled into scaffolds (k-mer size  86) using ABySS (version 2.0.2) (19). The
assembled genome size for ISS-F3 was 53.6 Mb and for ISS-F4 was 53.8 Mb, which is
comparable to the genome size of the model strain, F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strain
4287 (59.9 Mb) (20). Table 1 provides general assembly statistics of the draft genomes
of F. oxysporum ISS-F3 and ISS-F4.
Phylogenetic relationship of ISS-F3/F4 among different F. oxysporum f. sp. The
conserved marker gene translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1) was used to
determine the phylogenetic relatedness of ISS-F3/F4 to 62 other F. oxysporum strains,
belonging to various formae speciales, and seven strains belonging to other Fusarium
species included as outgroups, based on clonal (asexual) vertical inheritance. EF-1
allows for phylogenetic species recognition because it is applicable across Fusarium and
it is informative at or near the species level and orthologous across the genus (21).
Based on EF-1 phylotyping, F. oxysporum can be divided into 3 distinct clades with
various clonal lineages within each clade (22, 23). The phylogenetic tree inferred in
Fig. 1A clusters ISS-F3/F4 into clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage closely related to
4 other strains: three members of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and the non-plant-
pathogenic biocontrol strain Fo47 (members of a clonal lineage have the same se-
quence of conserved genes). Three other isolates of interest are highlighted in Fig. 1A
because they too had been isolated from harsh environments, two cultured from
ISS-grown Zinnia hybrida plants that caused foliar, stem, and root rot (VEG-01C1 and

12 years after the explosion. The ISS Z. hybrida strains fell into a different branch from
ISS-F3/F4 and were most closely related to IMV00293.
F. oxysporum genomes consist of a “core” set of housekeeping genes and an
“accessory” genome which is not required for vegetative growth but contains most of,
if not all, the genes that allow the fungus to invade and cause disease in a host plant
(20). Utilizing 104 effector candidates, van Dam et al. were able to show that strains
infecting the same host generally possess a similar set of effectors and that these
effectors are often identical within a forma specialis (24). This indicates that the

Fusarium species (bottom) were included to root the tree. The bootstrap conﬁdence (in percent; 1,000 replicates performed) is shown in red numbers in the
tree. (B) Presence/absence proﬁles of ISS-F3/F4 with 62 other strains based on 104 candidate effector proteins. Colored boxes indicate the presence of a

pathogens. ISS-F3/F4 contained relatively few effector genes compared to the number found in the plant pathogens (green, red, yellow, and blue) and showed
the most similar pattern (number and type) to Fo47, a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate with a biocontrol function.

accessory genome, speciﬁcally the effector genes residing in these regions, can be used
to identify formae speciales within the F. oxysporum species complex (FOSC), including
newly encountered strains (24). Figure 1B shows the hierarchical clustering of presence/
absence patterns of 104 effector sequences in ISS-F3/F4 along with 62 other strains. The
effector proﬁle of ISS-F3/F4 was the most similar to Fo47 (a non-plant-pathogenic soil
isolate that has been shown to exert a biocontrol function) (25) with similarities to
another non-plant-pathogenic isolate, MN25, and CL57 (NRRL 26381), an isolate causing
root rot in tomato, also known as NRRL 26381. The ISS-F3/F4 strains do not contain as
many effector genes as (almost) all of the plant pathogens examined and do not
possess any of the SIX genes (see top panel of Fig. 1B), which encode secreted fungal
proteins that were ﬁrst discovered in the xylem sap of infected tomato plants and have
a well-studied role in plant pathogenesis (26, 27).
Relationship between ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. Further analyses were conducted to
determine how closely related ISS-F3 and ISS-F4 were to each other. The sequences of
10 phylogenetically informative loci (28) were compared between the two strains, and
for all 10 loci, the sequences were identical between ISS-F3/F4. Second, a BLAST
comparison was performed using contigs above 2 kb for each strain. Using ISS-F3 as the
query, each of the 682 contigs matched a contig in ISS-F4 with either 99% or 100%
identity with an E value of 0. Last, when single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis
was performed against the reference genome Fo47, ISS-F3/F4 had the same single
nucleotide variants. For this reason, it is believed that ISS-F3/F4 are clonal derivatives of
each other.
Strain identiﬁcation. Based on EF-1 phylogeny (Fig. 1A) and the presence/
absence of effector proteins (Fig. 1B), ISS-F3/F4 appeared to be the most closely related
to Fo47. To determine whether the ISS strains were Fo47 or represented a distinct
strain, two in silico genomic comparisons were conducted.
(i) k-mer comparison. The KMC2 k-mer counter (29) was used to generate 50-bp
long k-mers from 65 F. oxysporum genomes that were downloaded from GenBank (see
Table S1 in Data Set S5 in the supplemental material). The k-mers generated from each
genome were compared against the k-mers from all other genomes to ﬁnd the ones
that were speciﬁc to each of the 65 genomes analyzed. From all genome-speciﬁc
k-mers that were identiﬁed, a subset was chosen from each genome to create the F.
oxysporum k-mer database. These sequences were chosen based on number of occur-
rences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome)
and the type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good
balance of GC and AT ratios). The sequences making up this database are listed in
Table S2.
The assembled genomes of ISS-F3/F4 were then compared using BLAST against the
F. oxysporum k-mer database, and for ISS-F3/F4 to be considered one of the 65 F.
oxysporum strains, every k-mer in the database belonging to a speciﬁc strain had to
have a perfect match in the genome. For example, all k-mers generated for strain Fo47
in the database needed to match sequences in either the ISS-F3 or -F4 genome 100%
(i.e., 50-bp k-mer/50-bp genome [no mismatches]) for ISS-F3 or -F4 to be considered
Fo47.
None of the Fo47 unique k-mer sequences matched sequences in the ISS-F3 or
ISS-F4 genome, and only 1 k-mer from strains radicis-lycopersici 26381 (CL57), UASWS
AC1, lycopersici Fol074, and melonis Fom009 found an exact match. Based on the
criteria above, ISS-F3/F4 were not the same strain as Fo47 nor any of the other 64
strains tested.
(ii) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. SNP genotyping was the
second in silico comparative method used to determine the relatedness of the ISS
isolates to that of Fo47. Using Fo47 as the reference genome, the number of SNPs in
the genomes of ISS-F3/F4 compared to Fo47 was calculated, along with other strains as
a comparison. These additional strains are listed in Table S3 in Data Set S5, along with
the reasons for choosing them. Phylogenies of these isolates inferred using maximum

they are distinct from Fo47 and the other strains included (Fig. 2A). Similar results were
obtained with SNPs across the entire genome (coding and noncoding regions) (data

of SNPs in coding regions, and the number of SNPs in noncoding regions is displayed
in Fig. 2B. The total numbers of SNPs in ISS-F3/F4 were 150,000 and 152,000, which are
more than lycopersici Fol016 and radicis-lycopersici 26381 (also known as CL57), which
are well-deﬁned, characterized strains, known to be different than Fo47.
Annotation of ISS-F3/F4 genes. Using the gene prediction program AUGUSTUS
(30), ISS-F3 was predicted to contain 16,648 genes and ISS-F4 had 16,729 genes. This
number is very close to the predicted number of genes (17,735) for the model strain,
F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 4287 (20, 31). The predicted genes were annotated with
BLAST2GO, and 47% of the genes in ISS-F3 and 56% in ISS-F4 could be matched to
known proteins while the remaining genes were listed as hypothetical (Data Sets S1
and S2). Among the predicted genes, 273 genes in ISS-F3 and 76 genes in ISS-F4 had
no similarity to fungal genes in the NCBI database (Data Sets S1 and S2) and could
possibly represent novel, unidentiﬁed fungal proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) functional
annotation was also performed with BLAST2GO, and 65% of the predicted genes in
ISS-F3 and 68% in ISS-F4 could be assigned a function (Data Sets S1 and S2). The most
frequently represented GO functional assignments were metabolic and cellular pro-
cesses (category: biological processes), catalytic activity and binding (category: meta-
bolic function), and membrane and membrane part components (category: cellular
component) (Fig. 3A). A summary of the 50 most abundant GO terms in each of the 3
categories mentioned above is presented in Fig. S1. Approximately 15% of the pre-
dicted genes were classiﬁed as enzymes, with hydrolases dominating followed by
transferases (Fig. 3B).
Protein families were classiﬁed and domains predicted with InterProScan, and 91%
of the predicted proteins in ISS-F3/F4 could be assigned a function. Abundant protein
domains in ISS-F3/F4 were the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) domain, the Zn(2)-C6
fungal-type DNA-binding domain, the fungal transcription factor domain, the ankyrin
repeat-containing domain, and the protein kinase domain (Fig. 4A). The abundant
protein families were the NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily, MFS transporter super-
family, P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type
DNA-binding domain superfamily, and the alpha/beta hydrolase fold (Fig. 4B). A
comparison was performed between the ISS strains isolated during this study and a
non-plant-pathogenic biocontrol soil isolate (Fo47) and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a).
While the most abundant domains and families in ISS-F3/F4 were also the most
abundant ones in Fo47 and FOSC-3a, the collective proportions differed, with Fo47 and
FOSC-3a more similar to each other than to ISS-F3/F4 (Fig. 4). There were also many
domains and families that were present in Fo47 and FOSC-3a that were not found in the
ISS-F3/F4 genomes and vice versa (Fig. S2). Data Set S3 shows the full list of protein
domains and families present in each of the different strains and the relative abun-
dances of each within each genome.
Identiﬁcation of candidate pathogenicity proteins and secondary metabolites.
Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large, multidomain protein complexes that catalyze the
sequential production of a diverse array of secondary metabolites (SM) with a range of
biological activities, including pigmentation, plant growth regulation, plant pathoge-
nicity/invasion, and toxicity toward humans and animals, with some having potential
for drug development and human beneﬁt (32–34). Different PKSs catalyze the synthesis
of structurally distinct polyketides, and to date 52 PKSs have been identiﬁed in Fusarium
with 16 found in F. oxysporum (35).
Due to the importance of PKS in SM production, predicted proteins composed of
PKS domains, based on the InterProScan results above, were further studied to identify
which PKSs (and the resulting polyketides) ISS-F3/F4 have the potential to express. The
amino acid sequences of ISS-F3/F4 proteins with PKS domains were compared using
BLAST against a database composed of PKSs identiﬁed from 12 strains of F. oxysporum
and 9 other Fusarium species (35).
The BLAST searches revealed the presence of 11 PKSs in the genomes of ISS-F3/F4
which have all been detected in other F. oxysporum strains (Fig. 5). Compared to the 12
F. oxysporum strains, the presence/absence PKS proﬁle of ISS-F3/F4 best resembled that

of Fo47, followed by FOSC-3a (Fig. 5). In addition to the 11 PKS proteins identiﬁed in
ISS-F3/F4, there were two proteins with ketoacyl synthase domains that did not match
anything in the database and could possibly represent novel, yet-unidentiﬁed Fusarium
PKSs.
A more extensive SM assessment was performed with antiSMASH, which identiﬁed
47 biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome of ISS-F3 and 46 in ISS-F4. To put this
ﬁnding into perspective, 44 biosynthetic gene clusters were identiﬁed in Fo47 while 47
clusters were present in the FOSC-3a. All four strains had biosynthetic gene clusters in

annotated using Blast2GO. Functions could be assigned to 10,789 of the 16,648 genes in ISS-F3 and 11,305 of the 16,729 genes in ISS-F4. (A) Bar charts
summarizing the most abundant GO terms for ISS-F3. BP, biological processes; MF, metabolic function; CC, cellular components. (B) Bar charts summarizing the
abundance of enzyme classes in ISS-F3. NB, ISS-F3/F4 had the same distributions of GO and enzyme class abundances, and thus, only ISS-F3 is shown for
simplicity. The distributions in ISS-F3/F4 were similar to Fo47 (non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate) and FOSC-3a (clinical isolate) (data not shown).

their genomes that are involved in the production of type 1 polyketides, nonribosomal
peptides, indoles, terpenes, and polyketide/nonribosomal peptide hybrids. While ISS-
F3, ISS-F4, and Fo47 had clusters involved in type III polyketide production, FOSC-3a did
not appear to have that machinery in its genome. A summary of the biosynthetic gene
clusters detected in the ISS-F3, ISS-F4, Fo47, and FOSC-3a genomes is shown in Fig. S3.
Virulence of F. oxysporum strains estimated in C. elegans model. F. oxysporum
f. sp. lycopersici strain 4287, a well-characterized model pathogen of tomato plants, was
shown to produce systemic disease in immunocompromised mice, resulting in a high
death rate (36). Utilizing F. oxysporum strain 4287 knockout mutants that exhibit altered
virulence in tomato plants, it was shown that certain virulence factors essential in plant
pathogenesis were dispensable in mammalian pathogenesis and vice versa (36). This
raises the possibility that certain phytopathogens could also be virulent in humans
depending on their health status. This is concerning given the fact that a recent study
on the impact of space on fungal pathogenesis has shown that Aspergillus fumigatus
isolates cultured from ISS surfaces were more virulent in a zebraﬁsh model of invasive
aspergillosis than Earth-based clinical isolates (37).
This prompted the examination of the virulence potential of ISS-F3/F4 in an immu-
nocompromised (MAPKK-deﬁcient) C. elegans model of invasive fusariosis. Included for
comparison was an F. oxysporum strain, IMV00293, isolated in the aftermath of the
Chernobyl disaster, ﬂown to the ISS and grown for 12 days (“293gr”), and grown
concomitantly on Earth (“293sp”).
Figure 6 demonstrates the effect of ﬁve strains of F. oxysporum on mortality of C.
elegans AU37. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of C. elegans analyzed with the log rank
(Mantel-Cox) test demonstrated that the virulence of F. oxysporum ISS-F4 was signiﬁ-
cantly greater than other strains (P  0.0001) (Fig. 6A). The culturing conditions for
fungal growth such as growing without antibiotic or with antibiotic used to prepare

synthase domain (one of 3 essential domains in polyketide synthases [PKSs]) were compared with BLAST against a PKS database (35) to determine which PKSs
ISS-F3/F4 had the ability to produce. Eleven PKSs found in ISS-F3/F4 are also present in 12 other F. oxysporum species that have been previously studied (35).
However, there were two additional PKSs, unkA and unkB, in ISS-F3/F4 that did not have any matches in the database. The ﬁrst column represents the PKS,
the last column shows the polyketide that the PKS makes (if known), and the middle columns indicate the F. oxysporum strains. Colored boxes indicate the
presence of a speciﬁc PKS in the genome. FoZG, Fo47; FoYG, FOSC-3a; FoXG, lycopersici 4287; FoXB, Fo5176; FoQG, raphani NRRL 54005; FoTG, vasinfectum

conidia did not affect ISS-F4 killing ability (P  0.6888). The majority of worms died due
to F. oxysporum hyphae piercing through the worm body (Fig. 6B); however, ISS-F4
virulence was attributed to both hypha- and non-hypha-related killing (Fig. 6C),
whereas ISS-F3 virulence was attributed solely to hypha-related mortality (Fig. 6D). The
hypha-related killing of ISS-F4 was still signiﬁcantly greater than other strains (P 
0.0129) (Fig. 6B). Importantly, while ISS-F3, 293gr, and 293sp had less killing capability
than ISS-F4, they should be still considered virulent, as their related mortality for worms
reached 50% at 50 h. To note, there were no differences in mortality between 293gr and
293sp, indicating that growth on the ISS (12 days) did not change the virulence of this
strain. Figure 7 shows microscopic images of C. elegans worms with hypha penetration,
22 h and 46 h after exposure to ISS-F4 conidia.
DISCUSSION
This study presents the genomic analysis of two F. oxysporum isolates, cultured from
the ISS, during an ongoing microbial tracking study. The phylogenetic placement of
these two strains based on EF-1 nucleotide sequence and whole-genome SNPs shows
that they are within the genetic variation of terrestrial strains and that their ability to
thrive in the space environment was not contingent on enhanced genetic variation.
F. oxysporum strains are well known for their plant pathogenicity, and for successful
infection of its plant host, effector proteins are secreted from the fungus that aid in the
colonization process. Performing disease assays to determine host speciﬁcity is both
laborious and time-consuming; however, a recent molecular screening method based
on 104 effector proteins was developed by van Dam et al. which can predict host
speciﬁcity in F. oxysporum (24). The presence/absence of these effector proteins in
ISS-F3/F4 was determined and compared to 62 other strains from a variety of formae

IMV00293 strain that was isolated from Chernobyl and grown on the ISS for 12 days, and 293gr is IMV00293 that was concomitantly grown
for 12 days on Earth.

speciales. The ISS strains contained relatively few candidate effector genes compared to
phytopathogens, with numbers similar to that detected in two non-plant-pathogenic
strains, Fo47 and MN14. The ISS isolates also did not contain any of the 14 secreted in
xylem (SIX) effector genes, which encode cysteine-rich secreted proteins that appear to
manipulate host defenses to promote infection (38). Based on the effector content, it
is unlikely that ISS-F3/F4 are plant pathogens. VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2, isolated from
Z. hybrida plants grown on the ISS and whole-genome sequences (39) also displayed
relatively few effector genes (Fig. 1B) and were unable to infect healthy Z. hybrida
plants (G. Massa, personal communication).
Based on effector content and EF-1 phylogeny, ISS-F3/F4 appeared to be the most
closely related to Fo47, a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate known for its biocontrol
properties. Based on the number of SNPs across the genome, the phylogeny inferred

using maximum likelihood from SNP sequences in both coding and noncoding regions,
and the k-mer analysis, ISS-F3/F4 were not Fo47 or identical to any of the 65 strains
compared in this study. Thus, it appears that these ISS isolates represent a genomically
unique strain, which has not yet been identiﬁed and characterized to date.
The ISS is a hermetically sealed system, closed off from its surrounding environment,
with microbial introduction being of terrestrial origin from astronauts and payloads.
ISS-F3/F4 were most likely introduced in the same fashion, so it begs the question why
they had been identiﬁed only on the ISS and not on Earth, where 150 formae speciales
have already been characterized (2). One hypothesis is that ISS-F3/F4 are present in
relatively low abundances on Earth but were selected because of their ability to
withstand ISS-associated environmental pressures such as increased radiation, which
compared to terrestrial indoor buildings, is 100 times greater. In a recent study by Byrne
et al., it was found that Escherichia coli developed extreme resistance to ionizing
radiation, comparable to that observed with Deinococcus radiodurans, with mutations
in only 9 genes, all of which happen to be involved in radiation resistance (40). When
these mutations were repaired, resistance was lost and the cells became sensitive to
radiation (40). This paper showed for the ﬁrst time that evolution of resistance may
occur via genetic adaptation rather than passive mechanisms based on changes in
cellular proteins. We therefore hypothesized that based on the sequences of ﬁve genes
known to have a role in radiation resistance in fungi, ISS-F3/F4 would appear to be
more closely related to IMV00293 (Chernobyl isolate) and VEG-01C1/VEG-01C2 (ISS Z.
hybrida isolates) (as they are strains also isolated from high-radiation environments)
compared to 64 other F. oxysporum strains. An inferred maximum likelihood tree was
constructed from concatenated sequences of rad54, rad53, rad51, rad2, and phr1 (a
photolyase) found in ISS-F3, ISS-F4, IMV00293, VEG-01C1, VEG-01C2, and 64 other F.
oxysporum strains. The branching observed with the radiation resistance genes was
similar to that observed with EF-1 in which ISS-F3/F4 grouped together, apart from
IMV00293, VEG-01C1, and VEF-01C2, which grouped together, with all ﬁve isolates
being within the genetic variation of the 64 other strains included (see Fig. S4 in the
supplemental material). A proteomics approach may provide more insight into whether
ISS-F3/F4 have a selective advantage for survival on the ISS and what that may entail.
The genomes of ISS-F3/F4 were largely made up of gene ontology categories
involved in metabolic and cellular processes and catalytic activity and binding. Overall,
the relative abundances of GO categories for ISS-F3/F4 were similar to that observed in
FOSC-3a, a clinical isolate, and Fo47, a biocontrol, non-plant-pathogenic strain. How-
ever, there were differences in the relative abundances and presence/absence of
protein domains and families between ISS-F3/F4 and FOSC-3a and Fo47, highlighting
the uniqueness of these strains. One such difference was the higher relative abundance
of genes encoding polyketide synthase domains in ISS-F3/F4. Each PKS makes a unique
polyketide, which collectively represent structurally diverse natural products with
commercial signiﬁcance for the pharmaceutical industries (41). A testament to its
importance is reﬂected in the annual sales of pharmaceuticals derived from polyketides,
which routinely reach $20 billion (42). For example, the anticancer drugs tetracycline
and doxorubicin, the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, the antibiotics erythromycin
and rifamycin, and the fungicide strobilurin are all polyketides that have been isolated
from either bacteria or fungi (43). A BLAST search against a PKS database (35) showed
that ISS-F3/F4 had the genomic machinery to produce 13 polyketides, 11 of which have
been found in other F. oxysporum strains. The two sequences in ISS-F3/F4 that did not
have any matches in the PKS database did match F. oxysporum hypothetical proteins in
NCBI. A more extensive analysis using proteomics and metabolomics will be performed
to elucidate the natural product repertoire of ISS-F3/F4.
F. oxysporum, though a well-known plant pathogen, may cause various infections in
humans and is a cause of emerging infections in immunodeﬁcient patients (44–46).
Vertebrate and nonvertebrate models are well established to test pathogens for their
potential virulence (36, 47–49). For virulence testing of F. oxysporum, a host is usually
immunosuppressed to make it susceptible to fungal infection (50). Symptoms of

disseminated fusariosis caused by F. oxysporum are remarkably similar between animals
and humans. They include development of invasive structures, including hypha micro-
conidia and chlamydospores, causing massive colonization of organs, and which can
cause thrombosis and necrosis (4, 50, 51). The nonvertebrate host C. elegans, a
free-living soil nematode, is one of the most useful models to study the virulence of
fungi and is well established by many researchers (52–54). C. elegans has an innate
immune response mechanism that is activated in the response to pathogens, including
fungi (55, 56). A key component of the C. elegans immune response is the p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (57). SEK-1 encodes a mitogen-
activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in this pathway and thus plays a vital role in
pathogen resistance in C. elegans (58). For this reason, SEK-1 mutants are considered
“immunocompromised” worms. Matricidal hatching of progeny inside the parent
worms occurs in SEK-1-deﬁcient C. elegans, and therefore, a mutation in glp-4, a locus
required for normal proliferation of the germ line (59), is required to avoid bias effects
due to progeny hatching. The glp-4 mutants are sterile at the restrictive temperature of
25°C, at which C. elegans experiments are performed.
Using the glp-4/sek-1 mutant strain AU37 of C. elegans obtained from the Caenorhabditis
Genetics Center, we observed that ISS-F4 was the most virulent, even compared to ISS-F3,
despite the fact that ISS-F3/F4 have very similar genomes and initially were thought to be
clonal derivatives of each other. Since ISS-F4 demonstrated killing ability by both hypha
piercing-related and -unrelated mechanisms, it is likely that it produces secreted virulence
factors. It is known that secreted proteins such as RP-1-like (60) and secreted in xylem (SIX)
proteins (61), which are regulated by Fusarium transcription factor 1 (FTF1) (62), are required
for full virulence of F. oxysporum. Further work is required to determine if there are
differences in production and regulation of the secreted factors between ISS-F3/F4 strains
and if time-dependent exposure to the ISS environment may affect this regulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of fungal strains. Surfaces (1 m2) were sampled on the ISS using premoistened 9-in. by
9-in. polyester wipes (ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) that were prepared as part of an ongoing microbial
tracking study during ﬂight sampling 3 (6 May 2016). Wipes were stored at room temperature (RT) before
being brought back to Earth, 6 days after sampling, where they were processed as described previously
(63). Material from the wipes was plated, 100 l, on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with
chloramphenicol (ﬁnal concentration, 100 g/ml) and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. Fusarium oxysporum,
identiﬁed by morphology and ITS region sequencing, was isolated from the ISS dining table. The two
isolates were designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4.
Whole-genome sequencing. (i) Genomic DNA extraction. Freezer stocks of ISS-F3/F4 were plated
on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25°C for 5 days, at which time the entire plate was
covered with fungal growth. The growth over the entire plate was scraped into a sterile mortar and
pestle containing a small amount of liquid nitrogen. The colonies were ground into a powder and then
transferred into PowerBead tubes from the MoBio PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, USA; catalog
number 12888), and the extraction protocol was followed per the manufacturer’s instructions, except for
the last step, in which DNA was eluted in 80 l of solution C6 (i.e., elution buffer). DNA was stored at
20°C until sent for sequencing.
(ii) Sequencing and assembly. Genomic DNA was paired-end sequenced (2  100 bp) with a 350-bp
insert size on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by Macrogen (Rockville, MD, USA). Totals of 48 million
reads for F3 and 42 million reads for F4 were generated. Trimmomatic on the Galaxy server (https://
usegalaxy.org) was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings: maximum mismatch, 2; accuracy
of the match between the two adaptor-ligated reads, 30; accuracy of the match between any adaptor,
10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings: minimum quality required to keep a base, 3).
Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled using ABySS version 2.0.2 (19) using the default settings.
Different k-mer sizes ranging from 68 to 90 were tested in order to ﬁnd the one that gave the highest
N50 score and lowest number of scaffolds/contigs, after assembly. The k-mer size 86 gave the best results
for both F3 and F4, and the resulting assemblies were used for downstream analyses.
Phylogenetic analysis. The phylogeny of the newly identiﬁed strains was assessed by extracting the
full-length gene sequence of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1) from each of the genomes
using BLASTN. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters (64), and phylogeny
was inferred with PhyML (65) (1,000 bootstraps; percent bootstrap conﬁdence is shown in red numbers
in the tree). The trees were visualized using ETE 3 (66). The effector clustering was done on only the F.
oxysporum strains, using the list of 104 curated F. oxysporum effector candidate genes and the same
clustering method as described in the work of van Dam et al. (24). Brieﬂy, 2.5-kb regions up- and
downstream of a miniature impala (mimp) transposable element were scanned for potential open
reading frames (ORFs) containing a signal peptide. This procedure was previously done by van Dam et

al. (24) for 59 individual isolates of F. oxysporum, and the resulting effector candidate genes were
grouped and merged into a list. Obvious false positives and transposable elements were removed, and
multiple instances of the same effector were reduced to one representative. This curated list represents
the “effectorome” of a varied set of plant-pathogenic formae speciales of F. oxysporum. Screening for the
presence of the putative 104 effectors was done using BLASTN (as described above). A binary data matrix
was generated containing presence (“1”) or absence (“0”’) of each candidate in each genome. This table
was used as input for hierarchical clustering performed in R, using a Jaccard binary distance matrix and
average linkage. The resulting matrix was visualized using the “heatmap3” package in R.
The sequences of the 10 phylogenetically informative loci used to compare ISS-F3/F4 were extracted
from the genomes using the sequences of these genes in the reference genome of F. oxysporum f. sp.
lycopersici 4287. The sequences were kindly provided by Li-Jun Ma from the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst. The loci and chromosomal locations from the reference genome are as follows: chromosome
1, DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC2 and RPB1; chromosome 4, minichromosome mainte-
nance protein 3 and anaphase-promoting complex subunit 1; chromosome 5, two hypothetical proteins,
FOXG 1751.3 and 2073.3; chromosome 7, DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2; chromosome
8, hypothetical protein FOXG 3560.3; and chromosome 9, clathrin heavy chain and DNA polymerase
gamma (28).
k-mer analysis for strain identiﬁcation. The KMC2 k-mer counter (29) tool was used to generate
50-bp-long k-mers from 65 F. oxysporum genomes that were downloaded from GenBank (ftp://ftp.ncbi
.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/fungi/Fusarium_oxysporum/) (see Table S1 in Data Set S5 in the sup-
plemental material). The KMC2 program was also used to determine which of the k-mers generated from
each genome were unique to that genome. A subset of the unique k-mers were chosen, based on
number of occurrences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome) and
the type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good balance of GC and
AT ratios). Using command line BLAST (version ncbi-blast-2.4.0), the genomes of F3 and F4 were used
as the query against the “database” of unique k-mer sequences. For ISS- F3 or ISS-F4 to be considered
one of the 65 F. oxysporum strains, every k-mer in the database belonging to a speciﬁc strain had to have
a perfect match against a sequence in either the F3 or F4 genome.
Single nucleotide polymorphism detection and phylogenetic analysis. We applied a reference-
based analysis method to determine the relatedness of F3 and F4 to the reference genome, Fo47, and
to 5 other F. oxysporum isolates. The list of these strains and the reasons for including them in the analysis
are presented in Table S3 in Data Set S5. These publicly available genomes were downloaded from the
NCBI sequence read archive (SRA). SNP identiﬁcation was carried out using PhaME (version 1.0.2) (67),
which uses Nucmer for pairwise alignment of genomes. Evolutionary analyses and phylogenetic trees
were constructed as part of the PhaME pipeline. The numbers of SNPs spanning the entire genome, in
coding regions, and in noncoding regions were extracted from the PhaME output using a custom Perl
script and plotted in Prism (version 7). In order to detect SNPs in the coding regions, a gff annotation ﬁle
of the reference genome (Fo47) was supplied as input.
Gene prediction and annotation. The genes of the assembled ISS-F3/F4 genomes were pre-
dicted with the AUGUSTUS gene prediction program using default settings and trained against
Fusarium graminearum (30, 68). The amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were uploaded
into Blast2GO (https://www.blast2go.com) (69), and annotation was performed with blastp-fast against
the NCBI nonredundant database, set to the “fungi” taxonomy ﬁlter. The E value cutoff was set to
1.0E10. Gene ontology classiﬁcation and InterProScan were also performed with Blast2GO using the
default settings.
Identiﬁcation of polyketides and secondary metabolites. Predicted proteins that were annotated
as polyketide synthases were further evaluated with the polyketide synthase database (35), which
consists of amino acid sequences of PKSs from 12 F. oxysporum strains and 8 other Fusarium species. A
blastp search was performed with F3 and F4 sequences, and a positive match was based on 95%
identity and an E value of 1E10.
Biosynthetic gene clusters were predicted with the fungal version of antiSMASH (https://fungismash
.secondarymetabolites.org). The input ﬁles were the (i) assembled whole-genome nucleotide sequences
and (ii) gff annotation ﬁle produced from AUGUSTUS. Default settings were used in the run.
C. elegans model for Fusarium oxysporum virulence. The glp-4/sek-1 mutant strain AU37 of
C. elegans obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (http://www.cbs.umn.edu/research/
resources/cgc) was used in the experiments.
C. elegans AU37 nematodes were synchronized for the experiment as previously described (70).
Synchronized nematodes were then grown on E. coli OP50 lawns until they reached the L3-L4 stage. Then
nematodes (about 300 worms) were collected and washed 3 times in 10 ml of M9 buffer (71) containing
50 g/ml kanamycin. On the last washing, worms were incubated in 10 ml M9 buffer containing
50 g/ml kanamycin for 1 h to clean the intestinal tube and surface of nematodes from E. coli. After
cleaning, nematodes were poured on plain agar plates (1.5% agar in water) to soak the kanamycin
solution into agar. At this point, synchronized fasting nematodes were ready for transferring into
experimental fungal conidium suspensions.
Fungal conidium suspensions were prepared by growing the fungal strains on PDA plates and
incubating them at 25°C for 7 days, at which time the plate was overgrown with growth. Eight milliliters
of ST solution (8.5 g NaCl, 1 ml Tween 80 in 1 liter of water) was poured onto the plates, and a cotton
swab was used to scrape all the moistened fungi off the plate. The liquid suspension on the plate was
then transferred to a 50-ml Falcon tube, spun down at 3,500  g for 5 min, and washed 3 times with
sterile PBS. The pellet was then resuspended in 5 ml of sterile PBS. To count the number of conidia in the

suspension, a 1/10 dilution was prepared using ST solution and conidia were counted using a hemo-
cytometer under the 40 objective of a light microscope. Conidial stocks were diluted in PBS to 107
conidia/ml prior to the experiment.
Twenty microliters of 107-conidia/ml F. oxysporum spores were suspended in 1 ml of 30% (vol/vol)
brain heart infusion broth (BHI broth; Remel, USA) prepared by dilution of BHI broth in M9 buffer. For
each conidium suspension, 60 worms were transferred from plain agar plates into 1 ml of a conidium
suspension and incubated for 1 h at 25°C without agitation. After incubation, the entire reaction volume
of conidium suspension with worms was transferred to a 60-mm dish containing 2 ml of M9 buffer
with 50 g/ml kanamycin. Then, worms were collected by a micropipette and transferred to a
60-mm dish containing 3 ml of M9 buffer with 50 g/ml kanamycin. This procedure was repeated 3
times using 3 ml of fresh M9 buffer with 50 g/ml kanamycin in a 60-mm dish at each transfer. After
ﬁnal washing, 10 worms were transferred into each experimental 30-mm dish (3 dishes per one
fungal strain conidium suspension) containing 2 ml of 30% BHI broth and 50 g/ml kanamycin.
Worms were incubated at 25°C without agitation, and worm death was estimated at 17, 24, 44, and
50 h after conidium exposure using an Olympus SZX16 microscope (5 magniﬁcation) with a camera
(Olympus DP30BW) for imaging.
