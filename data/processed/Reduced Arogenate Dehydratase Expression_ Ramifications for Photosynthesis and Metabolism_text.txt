Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the ﬁnal step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-
deﬁcient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants had signiﬁcantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines
that had deﬁciencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis ADT mutants using our phenomics facility and
ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of
ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon ﬂux into Phe
biosynthesis in ADT mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/
ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is
caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the
high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in ADT mutants revealed reduced
ﬂavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic
amino acids, and signiﬁcantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time
atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon ﬁxation rates between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6,
our most extreme ADT knockout mutant, which revealed no signiﬁcant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall,
these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis
with implications for plant improvement.
Arogenate dehydratases (ADTs) catalyze the dehy-
drative decarboxylation of arogenate to Phe (Jung et al.,
1986; Siehl and Conn, 1988; Cho et al., 2007) in the
stroma of chloroplasts and plastids in vascular plants
(Rippert et al., 2009). In terms of carbon allocation from
photosynthesis, only a very small fraction of this Phe
resides in proteins. Phe downstream metabolism is in-
stead targeted largely toward generating substrates/
precursors of lignin biopolymers and an enormous ar-
ray of compounds that are predominantly phenyl-
propanoid/phenylpropanoid acetate metabolites, such
as ﬂavonoids (Supplemental Fig. S1; Corea et al., 2012).
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has a six-member
ADT gene family. However, it is not well understood
(1) to what extent speciﬁc ADT genes are differentially
regulated as to carbon allocation into distinct down-
stream metabolic branches and/or (2) what effect dif-
ferential gene expression might have on metabolism
overall, including upstream effects on photosynthesis
capacity and source/sink relationships.
As shown previously, knockout mutants of the Ara-
bidopsis ADT gene family were associated with different
degrees of reduction of lignin content (Corea et al., 2012).
These plant lines were grown under long-day conditions
(16 h of light) from germination to maturation (8–
10 weeks), which induced stem elongation (bolting) and
ligniﬁcation. From the eight knockout lines generated,
single knockouts of ADT1 and ADT3 had no apparent
impact on bolting stem lignin content, whereas the ADT4
knockout resulted in a slightly higher lignin stem content
and the ADT5 knockout had decreased lignin stem
content by ;18%. The adt4/5 line displayed a further
reduction in lignin content of ;38%, as did the triple
knockouts adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5, which displayed ;50%
reductions. The quadruple knockout adt3/4/5/6 pos-
sessed the greatest magnitude of lignin reduction of
;70% and was unable to maintain bolting stem struc-
tural integrity. The double mutant adt4/5 and the tri-
ple mutants adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5 also displayed some
visual evidence of bolting stem structural weakening.
Due to this important role in cell wall lignin biosyn-
thesis, ADT is a potentially attractive target for meta-
bolic engineering of lignin contents in plants (Corea
et al., 2012). However, remodeling of plant metabolism
by genetic tools has to take into account the fact that
biochemical reactions in the cell are interconnected,
meaning that the manipulation of one speciﬁc pathway
can potentially have several systemic consequences.
Understanding such interdependencies is essen-
tial for metabolic engineering approaches to, for ex-
ample, improve traits of interests in crop plants and
forestry species. To explore the consequences of ADT

modulation, the effects on the reactions biochemically
upstream of photosynthetic energy conversion and
overall metabolism were examined in ADT mutants.
Here, we describe a high-throughput phenotyping
system (phenomics; Puthiyaveetil et al., 2014; Tietz
et al., 2015) that allowed us to monitor changes in
photosynthetic performance and growth over almost
the entire vegetative growth period of Arabidopsis
wild-type and ADT knockout mutant plants. For pho-
tosynthesis, this high-throughput approach was based
on non-invasive optical determination of key photo-
synthetic parameters derived from chlorophyll ﬂuo-
rescence measurements (Kramer et al., 2004; Baker,
2008; Brooks and Niyogi, 2011). Metabolomics analyses
performed following photosynthetic parameter assess-
ments (i.e. plants analyzed 44 days after sowing [DAS]),
as well as later (70 DAS), focused on both targeted and
non-targeted (polar) secondary metabolites using hy-
phenated
liquid
chromatography-high
resolution
mass spectrometry approaches. Real-time atmospheric
monitoring-mass spectrometry (RTAM-MS) also was
employed to evaluate net CO2 uptake rates. The sig-
niﬁcance of our ﬁndings is described below.
RESULTS
Selection of Growth Conditions
Arabidopsis is a facultative long-day plant; its ﬂow-
ering is delayed under short-day conditions (Haughn
et al., 1995; Koornneef et al., 1998). In our previous
studies, ADT knockout mutants (adt1, adt3, adt4, adt5,
adt4/5, adt1/4/5, adt3/4/5, and adt3/4/5/6) and wild-type
plants were grown under long-day conditions (16 h of
light and 8 h of dark), with lignifying stems beginning
to bolt by about 3 weeks (Corea et al., 2012).
For the photosynthetic studies described herein,
plants were grown under short-day conditions (9 h of
light), which are typically employed in Arabidopsis
photosynthetic studies. That is, plants did not form
inﬂorescence stems (Fig. 1A) within the study time
frame, as this developmental stage is delayed under
short-day conditions. The overall purpose here was to
simultaneously study, in our phenomics facility, the
effect of altered ADT activity on photosynthetic efﬁ-
ciency, plant growth parameters, and secondary me-
tabolism. Photosynthetic and growth parameters were
thus measured every 2 d. These measurements were
complemented by the determination of starch content
and other metabolomics analyses as well as the analysis
of net CO2 uptake of plants at the completion of the
phenomics analyses that were still in the vegetative
growth phase.
Establishing Phenomics Capability
Large-scale phenotyping of plants is an important
emerging ﬁeld in plant biology and agricultural re-
search (Tester and Langridge, 2010; Araus and Cairns,
2014; Fahlgren et al., 2015). However, it is a challenge to
ensure uniform environmental conditions over the en-
tire growth facility, as small heterogeneities in micro-
climates often occur that lead to artiﬁcial differences in
plant physiological responses. To minimize such po-
tential differences, a block approach was applied that
consisted of one wild-type and eight ADT mutant
plants per block (Fig. 1A). In this way, data gained from
the mutants can be normalized to the corresponding
wild-type plant in the same block. Since the block size is
small (26 3 26 cm), microclimate differences can be
considered to have a negligible effect. Starting with the
block arrangement, the entire phenomics facility was
ﬁlled as shown in Figure 1B, thereby permitting each
genotype to be measured in 12-fold replicates. To fur-
ther enhance the statistical signiﬁcance of comparisons
between ADT mutants and the wild type, four inde-
pendent sets of measurements were performed (Fig.
1C), creating 40 biological replicates per genotype.
Furthermore, for the automated determination of
physiological parameters from chlorophyll ﬂuores-
cence data, areas belonging to the plant were sepa-
rated from non-plant areas. This was readily achieved
by thresholding chlorophyll ﬂuorescence values (i.e.
when the ﬂuorescence intensity of a pixel is above a

certain level, it counts as part of the plant). Accord-
ingly, plant and nonplant areas can be separated
seamlessly (Fig. 1D).
An advantage of noninvasive optical screening is that
plants can be observed over long time periods without
perturbing growth/development. Wild-type and ADT
mutant plants were thus screened for over 4 weeks in
the phenomics facility starting from 20 DAS (Fig. 1F),
with plant size estimated as total pixel size that repre-
sents the projection of all plant leaves during the veg-
etative growth period studied (Fig. 1D). The growth
curves of the four individual sets of plants (Fig. 1E)
displayed quite high congruence that justiﬁed averag-
ing the four sets (Fig. 1F). Additionally, the 4-week
growth measurement in the phenomics facility (Fig. 1, E
and F) covers almost the entire vegetative life span from
young seedlings to mature plants, but prior to the onset
of inﬂorescence stem growth. Since the photosynthetic
phenotypes were most pronounced in the adt3/4/5/6
quadruple knockout relative to the wild type (Fig. 2A),
we concentrated on functional analysis of this mutant
for additional insights into effects on the photosynthetic
apparatus. This is detailed in the next section.
Phenomics Analysis with the adt3/4/5/6 Mutant
The consequences of impaired carbon ﬂux into lignin
and potentially other phenylpropanoid metabolites
with regard to photosynthetic primary reactions are
unknown. To address this, a comparison between adt3/
4/5/6 and wild-type plants was performed, with total
leaf areas plotted in Figure 2A. For young seedlings
(20–30 DAS) and older plants (40–50 DAS) prior to in-
ﬂorescence stem development, no signiﬁcant differ-
ences in leaf growth were apparent between both lines.
However, at midgrowth phase (30–40 DAS), where
plants show the most rapid increase in biomass, adt3/4/
5/6 plants displayed a somewhat diminished growth
relative to wild-type plants (Fig. 2A, with statistically
signiﬁcant differences marked by red stars).
To further study the impact of ADT modulation on
photosynthesis, a chlorophyll ﬂuorescence analysis was
conducted in parallel to the growth measurements. In this
regard, the FII parameter measures the photochemical
energy conversion efﬁciency of PSII and is a measure
of linear photosynthetic electron ﬂux (Genty et al., 1989;
Kramer
et
al.,
2004;
Baker,
2008).

quenching (qE) and the fraction of PSII reaction centers
that are open (qL; Kramer et al., 2004; Baker, 2008). The
latter is a measure of electron backpressure in the
photosynthetic
electron
transport
(PET)
chain
(expressed as the fraction of closed centers: 1-qL) and
depends on the efﬁciency of NADPH + H+ consump-
tion by downstream metabolic reactions (mainly the
Calvin-Benson cycle). Over the measurement period,
FII ﬂuctuated randomly by about 610% without a
time-dependent trend (Fig. 2B), although FII tended to
be slightly smaller for the adt3/4/5/6 line. This became
statistically signiﬁcant when FII was averaged over the
entire measuring period (Fig. 2B, right). When these
measurements were performed with plants at the end
of the night period (night-adapted [NA] plants), es-
sentially the same effect for FII was obtained for day-
adapted (DA) plants (measured around noon), as
shown in the histogram at right in Figure 2B.
The qE mechanism is induced by acidiﬁcation of the
thylakoid lumen that is caused by light-induced proton
pumping of PSII and the cytochrome b6f complex
(Ruban et al., 2012). As for FII, both qE and 1-qL ﬂuc-
tuated randomly over the measurement period (Fig. 2,
C and D). Therefore, they were averaged over the entire
time frame to identify signiﬁcant changes (Fig. 2, C and
D, right). Comparison of both parameters revealed that
the reason for the lower FII in adt3/4/5/6 was an in-
creased qE but not a change in redox status of the PET
chain (no change in 1-qL). The higher qE in the mutant
line is indicative of a higher DpH across thylakoid
membranes. These data provisionally suggested that
ATP, generated from ADP and inorganic phosphate
(Pi) during photosynthesis, was less efﬁciently con-
sumed by energy-dependent metabolic processes in
adt3/4/5/6 (i.e. DpH increased because substrates for the
DpH-consuming ATPase [ADP + Pi] became limiting
due to inefﬁcient consumption of ATP). Impairment in
metabolizing ATP in adt3/4/5/6 would be in accordance
with the observed overaccumulation of starch in the
DA samples acting as an ATP sink in adt3/4/5/6 plants
(Fig. 3A). This was supported further by measurements
of ATP/ADP ratios (see “Materials and Methods”). For
both the DA and NA light conditions, the ATP/ADP
ratios for adt3/4/5/6 were higher compared with those
in the wild type (0.77 and 0.6 for adt3/4/5/6 versus 0.62
and 0.52 for the wild type, respectively), which
suggested restricted ATP consumption in adt3/4/5/6.
PET and Electrochromic Shift Measurements
To characterize photosynthetic energy conversion in
more detail, light saturation curves were recorded un-
der laboratory conditions (Fig. 4). The measurements
utilized NA leaves adapted to different light intensities
with
the
dark-interval-relaxation
kinetics
(DIRK)
method (for details, see “Materials and Methods”). The
determination of qE requires a dark period after illu-
mination that is impractical for measuring a light sat-
uration curve (constant changes of light intensities).
Therefore, the nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ)
parameter was measured instead, this being dominated
by the qE component (Baker, 2008). NPQ can be used as
a proxy for qE (herein, for the sake of simplicity, the
term NPQ will be used also if qE is measured). As ex-
pected, increasing light intensity led to reduction in FII
(Fig. 4A) because of electron backpressure from the
Calvin-Benson cycle (saturation of biochemical pathways)

and down-regulation of PSII activity by NPQ. The FII
values for the wild type and adt3/4/5/6 at 200 mmol quanta
m–2 s–1 were between 0.35 and 0.4, which is in good
agreement with the data collected for NA plants in the
phenomics facility (;0.32) for the same light intensity (Fig.
2B). Activation of NPQ with increasing light intensity was
clearly observed (Fig. 4B). Comparing the wild type with
adt3/4/5/6 showed a small decrease in FII (5%–10%) and
a small increase in NPQ (5%–15%), mainly at moderate
light intensities (120–300 mmol quanta m–2 s–1; i.e. ap-
proximately the light intensity of the 200 mmol quanta
m–2 s21 used in the phenomics facility). Plotting FII as a
function of NPQ showed an almost linear correlation with
no signiﬁcant differences observed between the wild type
and adt3/4/5/6 (Fig. 4C). This high congruence gave strong
evidence that the sensitivity of linear electron transport
ﬂux on the NPQ mechanism was unchanged in adt3/4/5/6.
To understand why NPQ was higher in adt3/4/5/6,
the proton motive force (PMF) across the thylakoid
membrane was measured by employing electrochromic
shift (ECS) measurements on intact leaves. The ECS
measurement is a noninvasive optical absorption
method that quantiﬁes the magnitude of the light-
generated PMF in thylakoid membranes (Bailleul
et al., 2010), with an apparent peak absorption at
520 nm (Witt, 1979; Bailleul et al., 2010). For relative fast
absorption measurements (faster than 1 s), the A520 is
almost free of other signal components that could in-
terfere. It was next measured in the DIRK measuring
mode on NA plants. Typical measurements for differ-
ent light intensities (ranging from 70 to 850 mmol
quanta m–2 s–1) are shown in Figure 5A. The actual ECS
signal for a given light intensity (ECS total) is given as
the difference of absorption level in the light minus the
level in the subsequent dark pulse (see the arrow in Fig.
5A, for 850 mmol quanta m–2 s–1). Figure 5B shows a
statistical analysis of ECS amplitude as a function of
light intensity. Increasing the latter led to higher ECS,
because the rate of light-induced proton pumping by
PSII and the cytochrome b6f complex increased. The
ECS was saturated at around 400 mmol quanta m–2 s–1.
Importantly, the ECS was higher in adt3/4/5/6 com-
pared with wild-type leaves. Thus, the higher light-
generated PMF in adt3/4/5/6 was most likely the
reason for its elevated NPQ (Figs. 2C and 4B). The
higher PMF in adt3/4/5/6 agrees with data described
above that indicate restricted ATP consumption.
Metabolomics of the Wild Type and ADT Mutants
Two sets of metabolomics analyses of the rosette
leaves were carried out. The ﬁrst set corresponded with
the completion of the photosynthetic (phenomics)
study at 44 DAS, whereas the second was at 70 DAS,
when all plant lines were still in vegetative growth (i.e.
they were not senescing).
Metabolic Analysis of Rosette Leaves (70 DAS)
Nine plants for all of the different lines were harvested
for both DA and NA treatments 70 DAS. This was partly
in order to establish whether, under short-day condi-
tions, the different ADT knockout mutants displayed
similar trends in terms of modulating (reducing) levels of
soluble low-Mr phenylpropanoid/phenylpropanoid ac-
etate metabolites, as noted previously for lignins when
grown under long-day conditions (Corea et al., 2012). In
addition, analyses of both DA and NA plant lines were
aimed at determining speciﬁc changes that could po-
tentially be affected by the circadian rhythm.
Non-targeted metabolomics analyses were ﬁrst con-
ducted. Using freely available computational tools (XCMS,

ionization chromatograms were processed for reten-
tion time correction and integration, resulting in ;540
detected features (i.e. unique m/z versus retention time
signals). Initially, we focused on comparing wild-
type plants with adt3/4/5/6 plants, the latter being
hypothesized to display the most dramatic effects on
metabolism given the phenotype observed. In this
comparison, we identiﬁed 304 and 250 features that
were altered signiﬁcantly (P # 0.05, after normaliza-
tion to the internal standard naringenin recov-
eries) following comparison of DA and NA plants,
respectively. Supplemental Table S1 summarizes the
features detected with corresponding statistical analy-
sis for all individual features.
An initial global assessment of the metabolomics data
also was performed using hierarchical clustering anal-
ysis (HCA) and partial least square discriminant anal-
ysis (PLSDA), after peak intensities were normalized to
internal standard naringenin recoveries, centered, and
standardized. This initial analysis was used for rapid
visualization of overall metabolic effects and trends
across the different ADT mutants and time of harvest
(i.e. DA and NA plants) as well as for the selection of
those metabolites most signiﬁcantly affected by ADT
modulation, thereby helping guide subsequent anno-
tation efforts.
It was next instructive to establish (to the extent possible)
the identities of signiﬁcantly altered features. Accordingly,
our experimental approach focused on the known polar
secondary metabolites found in Arabidopsis. These in-
cluded ﬂavonoids, phenylpropanoids (i.e. sinapoyl esters
and lignans), benzenoids, and glucosinolates (D’Auria and
Gershenzon, 2005; Nakabayashi et al., 2009), as detected in
chromatograms of leaf extracts (Supplemental Fig. S2). In
this regard, compounds were identiﬁed either through the
use of authentic standards or were annotated based on
comparisons with the literature and/or public spectral li-
braries of known Arabidopsis metabolites (D’Auria and
Gershenzon, 2005; Glauser et al., 2008; Nakabayashi et al.,
2009; Matsuda et al., 2010). In addition, a third group of
features was provisionally annotated in terms of putative
chemical class (Sumner et al., 2007), but their structures
were not unambiguously determined (Supplemental
Table S1).
In the wild type, six ﬂavonoids, some of the most
characteristic and abundant metabolites in Arabi-
dopsis (Veit and Pauli, 1999; Saito et al., 2013),
were detected. These consisted of four kaempferol
glycosides
(kaempferol-3-glucoside-7-rhamnoside,
kaempferol-3-glucoside-2ʹʹ-rhamnoside-7-rhamnoside,
kaempferol-3-glucoside-2ʹʹ-glucoside-7-rhamnoside, and
kaempferol-3,7-dirhamnoside) and two quercetin deriva-
tives (quercetin-3-glucoside-7-rhamnoside and quercetin-3-
glucoside-2ʹʹ-rhamnoside-7-rhamnoside; Supplemental Fig.
S3A; Table I).
Another abundant metabolite class in Arabidopsis ex-
tracts was the glucosinolates (Brown et al., 2003). These
included the known Phe-derived gluconasturtiin (2-
phenethylglucosinolate), three indole-derived glucosino-
lates (4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, 1-methoxyglucobrassicin
and glucobrassicin), and seven aliphatic glucosinolates
(glucoiberin, glucoraphanin, glucoalyssin, glucohesper-
alin, glucoibarin, glucohirsutin, and hexyl glucosinolate
or 4-methylpentyl glucosinolate; Supplemental Fig. S3B;
Table I).
The extracts also contained several other known
phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites, corresponding
to monomeric or dimeric (lignan) phenylpropanoid
metabolites (D’Auria and Gershenzon, 2005; Seneviratne
et al., 2015). The former included three known malate-
containing
compounds
(5-hydroxyferuloyl
malate,
sinapic acid malate ester, and sinapoyl malate) as well
as three glycosides (coniferin, 1,2-di-O-sinapoyl-b-D-
Glc, and sinapic acid glucoside; Supplemental Fig.
S3C). The dimeric phenylpropanoids (lignans) in-
cluded two known pinoresinol derivatives (pinor-
esinol-4,4ʹ-di-O-b-D-glucoside
and
pinoresinol-4-O-
b-D-glucoside; Supplemental Fig. S3D; Seneviratne
et al., 2015); however, there were four other putative
lignans detected (Table I; Supplemental Tables S1 and

sides (Table I), but with no precise structure being de-
termined due to the lack of sufﬁcient material for
unambiguous structure determination.
Three putative galactolipids also were detected. These
were annotated previously in Arabidopsis (Glauser et al.,
2008), based on comparison of high-resolution tandem
mass
spectrometry
(MS/MS)
spectra,
as
sn1-O-(12-
oxophytodienoyl)-monogalactosyl monoglyceride, sn1-O-
(12-oxophytodienoyl)-digalactosyl
monoglyceride,
and
sn2-O-(di-nor-oxophytodienoyl)-monogalactosyl
mono-
glyceride (Supplemental Fig. S3E; Table I).
Finally, three putative phenolic glucosides were
detected, including one hydroxybenzoic acid gluco-
pyranoside and two isomers of dihydroxybenzoic acid-
O-pentoside (Table I).
Quadruple, Triple, and Double ADT Knockouts
Statistical comparison of individual metabolite levels
in adt3/4/5/6, the most greatly affected mutant line,
versus the wild type can be found in Table I. For the
ﬂavonoids mentioned above, signiﬁcant changes in
levels were observed in adt3/4/5/6, with reductions of
;40% and ;30% in NA and DA plants compared with
wild-type plants. Compared with levels in the wild
type, the adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5 triple knockouts also had
very similar ﬂavonoid reductions of ;40% and ;26%
in NA and DA plants, whereas the double knockout
adt4/5 had smaller ﬂavonoid reductions of ;17% (Fig.
6A). By comparison, under these growth conditions, the
ﬂavonoid reduction levels in adt3/4/5/6 were just over
half of those observed for long-day-grown plant lines.
Monomeric phenylpropanoid and lignan contents
followed somewhat comparable trends, with multiple
ADT knockouts having the most pronounced effects
(Fig. 6, B and C, respectively). For the monomeric
phenylpropanoids, their amounts in triple and qua-
druple knockouts were reduced by ;25% and ;20% in
NA and DA plants, respectively, relative to that in the
wild type. A slightly lesser effect (i.e. a reduction of
;12%) was observed in adt4/5. Lignans displayed a
similar pattern, with highest reductions in triple and
quadruple knockout lines, reaching reductions of ;64%
to 68% and ;58% to 67% in NA and DA plants, re-
spectively. In adt4/5, slightly lower reductions of ;58%
were observed for NA plants and 55% for DA plants.
Signiﬁcant differences were observed in levels of
other metabolite classes not derived directly from Phe.
Putative phenolic glucoside levels were reduced sig-
niﬁcantly (Fig. 6D), reaching reductions of ;31% and
;44% for NA and DA adt3/4/5/6 plants, respectively,
relative to that in the wild type. In addition, the triple
knockout adt1/4/5 had reductions of ;21% and ;40%
for NA and DA plants, respectively, whereas adt3/4/5
displayed reductions of ;35% for both NA and DA
plants. The double knockout adt4/5 had a somewhat
smaller reduction in phenolic glucosides of ;28%.
Another striking observation was with the levels of
the 11 glucosinolates that were detected at signiﬁcantly
lower levels in ADT knockouts relative to the wild type
(Fig. 6, E and F). Of these, the reduction in levels of
gluconasturtiin (Fig. 6F) could be anticipated, since it is
partly derived from Phe (Underhill, 1968). Indeed, its
levels were very much affected, reaching reductions of
;77% in both NA and DA adt3/4/5/6 plants. The triple
knockout adt3/4/5 also had ;77% and ;58% reduc-
tions in NA and DA plants, respectively, whereas adt1/
4/5 had ;65% and ;70% reductions, relative to the wild
type. The double knockout adt4/5 additionally dis-
played some levels of reduction, albeit to a slightly
lesser extent, with reductions of ;54% and ;60% in NA
and DA plants, respectively.
Although less pronounced, signiﬁcant overall re-
ductions in the levels of all other glucosinolates also
were detected (Fig. 6E), with ;39% and ;42% reduc-
tions in adt3/4/5/6 NA and DA plants and ;36%/;31%,
and ;27%/;16% reductions in adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5
NA and DA plants, respectively. The double mutant
adt4/5 displayed a reduction of ;37% in total glucosi-
nolate in DA plants, but no signiﬁcant reduction (;6%)
was observed in NA plants (Fig. 6E).

Höhner et al.

We also detected several metabolites with signiﬁcantly
higher levels in ADT-deﬁcient plant lines. Of these, we
annotated three putative galactolipids that were pre-
sumed to be abundant in the thylakoid membrane and
that could be related to altered photosynthetic parame-
ters (Kobayashi et al., 2013). The relative amounts of
these compounds displayed a clear circadian rhythm
pattern (i.e. barely detectable in DA plants versus sig-
niﬁcantly higher contents in NA plants; Fig. 6G). Besides
that, their contents in NA plants also were affected sig-
niﬁcantly by changes in ADT, with levels increasing
further from single to multiple knockouts. Of these, the
most markedly altered were those in adt3/4/5/6 plants,
where the amounts detected were approximately double
the content observed in wild-type plants.
Single Knockouts
While multiple knockout lines had the most dramatic
effects in reductions in levels of most metabolites
detected, the single knockouts had differing effects for
different metabolite classes. For combined total ﬂavo-
noid levels (also for each individually), adt1 had the
most pronounced reductions in comparison with the
wild type (;30% change [P = 0.016] and ;20% [P =
0.006] in NA and DA plants, respectively) of the various
single knockout lines (Fig. 6A; Supplemental Table S1).
Monomeric phenylpropanoid levels followed the same
trend somewhat, with the adt1 line also having highest
reductions in comparison with the wild type (;30%
[P = 0.003] and ;10% [P = 0.02] in NA and DA plants,
respectively; Fig. 6B; Supplemental Table S1). Lignan
content, however, was not affected signiﬁcantly in any
single knockout line in comparison with wild-type
plants (Fig. 6C; Supplemental Table S1).
In contrast, phenolic glucoside levels in single
knockouts were reduced more signiﬁcantly in adt4 and
adt5 plants in comparison with wild-type plants, with
;35% (P = 0.01) and 25% (P = 0.02) reductions, re-
spectively, in NA plants and ;28% (P = 0.05 for adt4
plants and P = 0.03 for adt5 plants) reductions in DA
plants (Fig. 6D; Supplemental Table S1). While in the
adt1 plants, no signiﬁcant differences were observed in
phenolic glucoside contents in NA plants, the DA
plants had a signiﬁcant (P = 0.014) level of reduction
(;40%). On the other hand, adt3 plant lines were not
signiﬁcantly different from the wild type.
Glucosinolate levels in NA plants were mainly signiﬁ-
cantly different in the comparison of adt4 and adt5 with
wild-type lines, with reductions of ;36% (P = 0.0001) and
26% (P = 0.02), whereas the corresponding DA plants had
greater reductions of ;52% (P = 0.01) and ;47% (P = 0.03),
respectively (Fig. 6E; Supplemental Table S1).
Finally, for putative galactolipid levels, the adt4 line
potentially had the second highest increase among all
lines relative to wild-type levels (;60%), although this
was not statistically signiﬁcant due to the variability
observed (P = 0.115; Fig. 6G; Supplemental Table S1).

oxygen atoms also were detected at higher levels in
ADT knockouts relative to the wild type. We provi-
sionally postulate that they belong to the apocarotenoid
metabolite class (Matsunami et al., 2009) and perhaps
may have a direct relationship with the photosynthetic
effects observed (i.e. given carotenoid roles in light
harvesting and photoprotection, as hormones and
growth regulators, and in other environmental inter-
actions; Ruiz-Sola and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2012).
The unequivocal annotation of these compounds re-
quires a complete structural characterization that was
not possible here due to their low abundance.
Metabolic Analysis of Rosette Leaves (44 DAS)
The analysis of leaves of DA wild-type and adt3/4/5/6
plants, harvested 44 DAS, showed comparable trends
to those at 70 DAS. When compared with DA wild-type
plants, DA adt3/4/5/6 plants at 44 DAS showed signiﬁ-
cant (P , 0.01) decreases in levels of the lignan gluco-
sides
M565T765,
M521T765,
and
M519T836
(for
compound names, see Table I) by ;34%, 63%, and 57%,
respectively; the corresponding DA plants at 70 DAS
had ;58 to ;67% reductions. We also detected reduced
levels of the monomeric phenylpropanoids M385T589,
M339T796, and M339T808 by ;40%, 24%, and 18%,
respectively, but the ﬁrst with P , 0.05 only; DA plants
at 70 DAS had ;20% reductions. Flavonoids were de-
creased slightly in amounts: M739T610 and M593T713
by ;7% and ;17%, respectively, compared with ;30%
in DA plants at 70 DAS. As before, we observed in-
creases
in
the
levels
of
putative
galactolipids
(M545T1236, M735T1343, and M573T1455 by ;25%,
24%, and 13%, respectively), which correspond favor-
ably to those in DA plants at 70 DAS.
RTAM-MS of CO2
From our starch measurements, we discovered that
starch accumulation in adt3/4/5/6 was higher in DA
plants than in the wild type (Fig. 3A), and this was in-
versely correlated to linear electron ﬂux (Fig. 7). Thus,
we further investigated whether there was also a sig-
niﬁcant difference in respiration rate of net carbon ﬁx-
ation in relation to the different starch levels observed.
To do this, we measured CO2 absorption and release
rates in adt3/4/5/6 and wild-type plants with large
starch reserves (DA) or in plants depleted of starch
(NA). A real-time atmospheric mass spectrometer was
used to measure CO2 levels of wild-type and adt3/4/5/6
plants under both DA and NA conditions. The DA and
NA plants were then subjected to a period of dark or
light in order to observe whether there was a differen-
tial rate of respiration or carbon ﬁxation between the
wild type and adt3/4/5/6.
Figure 8 shows the median CO2 levels ﬁxed by wild-
type and adt3/4/5/6 plants under NA and DA condi-
tions. For NA plants, the wild type and adt3/4/5/6, when
exposed initially to light, presumably begin to ﬁx CO2,

but this initial rate of CO2 uptake appears to not yet be
at a level to offset night time respiration rates. These
measurements occurred 50 min after the light change,
and all photosynthetic and respiration machinery may
not be fully switched over yet between light and dark
conditions, which could explain the negative CO2 up-
take. Whereas adt3/4/5/6 plants seemed to have a higher
CO2 uptake rate than wild-type plants at the time point
measured, a Student’s t test performed between the two
groups of measurements indicated no signiﬁcant dif-
ference (P = 0.20). In plants that have high levels of
accumulated starch (DA conditions) and that are sub-
jected to the dark when respiration pathways would
dominate, there appeared to be a higher rate of respi-
ration in adt3/4/5/6 compared with the wild type, but
this increased rate also was not statistically signiﬁcant.
DISCUSSION
Plant Growth/Development, Photosynthetic Performance,
ATP, and Carbon Sinks
Our high-throughput phenomics platform (Figs.
1 and 2) allowed the detection of small but signiﬁcant
changes in physiological parameters and photosyn-
thetic performance. The analysis of PET showed sig-
niﬁcantly decreased rates for linear electron ﬂux,
measured as FII, in the ADT mutants relative to the
wild-type plants (Figs. 2B and 4A). Detailed analysis of
this PET reduction revealed that it resulted from an
elevated qE (Figs. 2C and 4B), which causes heat dis-
sipation of the harvested sunlight no longer available
for photosynthesis. Further analyses indicated that the
increased qE in adt3/4/5/6 resulted from a higher DpH
across the thylakoid membrane, as measured by ECS
(Fig. 5B).
Our data also indicated that transitory starch in
chloroplasts could serve, at least in part, as an alterna-
tive carbon sink in ADT-deﬁcient plants. That is, in the
adt3/4/5/6 knockout, the starch content was increased
by more than 60% in DA plants and all other knockouts
also had elevated starch contents even after 70 DAS
(Fig. 7A). Furthermore, comparing starch contents
(Fig. 3A) with secondary metabolite data (Fig. 3, B–E)
revealed an inverse relationship that provisionally
suggested the redirection of ﬁxed carbon from phe-
nylpropanoid metabolites into starch. Yet, the growth
curve for adt3/4/5/6 (Fig. 2A) also indicated that addi-
tional carbon used from transitory starch reserves in the
night was not utilized to increase plant growth in
the mutant. In fact, growth was retarded slightly in the
quadruple mutant as compared with wild-type plants.
This could be interpreted as an indication that the ex-
cess carbon/energy (i.e. by reduced metabolism into
phenylpropanoid metabolites/lignins) was not used
for enhanced plant growth. Indeed, the carbon stored
was transitory, as the starch was fully metabolized
when photosynthesis was shut down in the NA period
(Fig. 3A, left). Where this catabolized ﬁxed carbon ends
up is currently unknown.
A potential direct connection between secondary
metabolism produced by carbon processing through
ADT and photosynthesis is ATP. Metabolic pathways
leading to lignin and other phenylpropanoids utilize
considerable amounts of ATP (Lewis and Yamamoto,
1989). It is not clear, however, whether this ATP comes
from respiration, photosynthesis, or both. Yet, with the
ADT-catalyzed conversion of arogenate to Phe being
localized in the chloroplast, it is possible that ATP
produced by photosynthetic light reactions makes a
major contribution. Increased starch content is in line
with an expected reduction in the putative ATP con-
sumption in ADT knockouts (i.e. since starch synthesis
requires ATP; Geigenberger et al., 2005). Thus, it seems
that the transient accumulation of starch could be re-
lated to the diminished level of ATP required for phe-
nylpropanoid metabolism and lignin biosynthesis in
ADT knockouts.
The photosynthetic performance measurements of
adt3/4/5/6 also indicated that starch synthesis only
partly compensated for the reduced demand for ATP
consumption. This became apparent by analyzing the
correlation between starch contents and linear electron
transport (measured as FII) for the wild type and all
ADT knockouts (Fig. 7B). Higher starch accumulation
in the different knockouts was accompanied by a lower
linear photosynthetic electron ﬂux. This suggests a
limited consumption of extra ATP produced in the
mutants by the formation of transitory starch with
feedback to electron transport by an increased PMF
(Fig. 5). The quadruple mutant, though, still has higher
ATP levels, as indicated by elevated DpH that leads to
higher qE and lower electron ﬂux and the elevated
ATP/ADP ratio. In this way, reduced phenylpro-
panoid biosynthesis can be envisaged to have two
interconnected consequences for photosynthesis: (1)
reduced consumption of ﬁxed carbon by the Calvin-
Benson cycle, leading to an increase in transitory
starch; and (2) lowered consumption of ATP, leading to
slightly lower electron transport rates via an increase in
the feedback regulation of qE.
Metabolomics
As anticipated, some of the most marked effects ob-
served at the end of the photosynthetic measurement
period were the reductions in levels of metabolites de-
rived directly from Phe (i.e. ﬂavonoids, monomeric
phenylpropanoids, and lignans). In contrast, the levels
of the phytohormones salicylic acid and jasmonic acid
were below detection limits under the conditions
employed (data not shown). For those metabolite clas-
ses detected, the largest reductions were observed in
the multiple ADT knockout mutants, whereas the
smallest
reductions
were
associated
with
single
knockouts (i.e. adt1, adt3, adt4, and adt5).
More speciﬁcally, in the quadruple knockout adt3/4/
5/6, levels of the Phe-derived lignans (Figs. 3D and 6C)
and gluconasturtiin (Fig. 6F) were most affected (;67%
Plant Physiol. Vol. 177, 2018
125
Phenylpropanoid Metabolism and Photosynthesis

and ;77% reductions, respectively), which was com-
parable to the lignin content reductions of ;70% in
adt3/4/5/6 plants under long-day growth/development
(Corea et al., 2012). By contrast, compared with those in
the wild type, Phe-derived ﬂavonoid (Figs. 3B and 6A)
and phenolic glucoside (Figs. 3E and 6D), as well as
overall glucosinolate (Fig. 6E), levels in adt3/4/5/6 were
reduced by only ;30% to ;45%, and those of phenyl-
propanoids (Figs. 3C and 6B) were reduced by only by
25%.
Nevertheless, under short-day growth conditions,
the knockout of individual ADT genes led to somewhat
different outcomes than those observed for lignin con-
tents in long-day-grown plants (Corea et al., 2012).
Speciﬁcally, the adt1 knockout displayed the greatest
reduction in levels of metabolites derived directly from
Phe, especially for monomeric phenylpropanoids and
ﬂavonoids. Conversely, lignin contents under long-day
growth/development were reduced the most in adt5,
whereas there was no detectable effect on lignin con-
tents in adt1 plants (Corea et al., 2012). Additionally,
glucosinolate levels were most reduced in adt4 (Fig. 6E),
whereas they had no reduction in lignin contents
(Corea et al., 2012). These data apparently suggest quite
a distinct role in metabolic pathway carbon allocation
and could indicate a speciﬁc role for ADT4 in, for ex-
ample, gluconasturtiin biosynthesis.
Although the reduction in Phe-derived gluconas-
turtiin content described above was expected, the re-
ductions in the levels of other glucosinolates were
striking. That is, partial blockage of Phe biosynthesis
also led to reduced levels of glucosinolates that are
biosynthetically independent of Phe. This pleiotropic
effect (i.e. when one gene inﬂuences two or more
seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits) is nevertheless
consistent with previous research suggesting possible
cross talk between glucosinolate and phenylpropanoid
biosynthetic pathways (Hemm et al., 2003; Kim et al.,
2015; Mach, 2015). Furthermore, this class of Brassica-
ceae metabolites (Matthäus and Luftmann, 2000),
characteristic of Arabidopsis, is used as defense com-
pounds and has long been linked directly to responses
to wounding and insect herbivory. Their effectiveness is
due to the release of toxic isothiocyanates (Grubb and
Abel, 2006; Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006; Beekwilder
et al., 2008). Clearly, a reduction in the levels of both
phenylpropanoids and glucosinolates could potentially
lessen overall chemical defenses of ADT-deﬁcient
plants, thus causing negative effects regarding ﬁtness.

adt3/4/5/6 values (Student’s t test, P = 0.194 and 0.993 for the NA and
DA data sets, respectively).

Lastly, the global metabolomics analysis of leaf tissue
extracts from the various ADT mutants and the wild type,
initially used for the selection of metabolites of interest,
is revisited by focusing on the annotated compounds
among the hundreds of signiﬁcantly altered features
(Supplemental Table S1). HCA (Fig. 9A) and PLSDA (Fig.
9B) analyses can be presented in a form that provides a
comprehensive view of the data, clearly illustrating the
trends observed. In this regard, HCA groups features that
are based on trends across samples, with above-average
features in red and below-average features in green. In
Figure 9A, we can clearly observe two main groups of
opposite behavior, namely those that accumulate to lower
levels in ADT knockout lines and those that accumulate to
higher amounts. The ﬁrst and largest group contains ﬂa-
vonoids, phenylpropanoids, lignans, phenolic glucosides,
and glucosinolates. The second group consists of the pu-
tative apocarotenoid compounds that are present in higher
amounts in the knockout lines and the putative gal-
actolipids, with the latter subject to a pronounced circadian
rhythm effect (Fig. 6G). The PLSDA analysis simpliﬁes
multiple variables (features) into two orthogonal compo-
nents that clearly distinguish between the wild type and
adt3/4/5/6 and between DA and NA plants (Fig. 9B). In this
analysis, we can see not only separation of the different
groups of samples but, with the overlaid loadings for the
different annotated metabolites, we can also rapidly visu-
alize those metabolites that are characteristic of the differ-
ent lines and harvest times. The strongest effect is in the
separation of the wild type and adt3/4/5/6, with the Phe-
derived compounds, phenolic glucosides, and glucosino-
lates being characteristic of the wild type and galactolipids
and putative apocarotenoids associated with adt3/4/5/6.
Carbon Fixation and Respiration Rates
Our data show higher levels of starch accumulation but
do not show signiﬁcantly higher rates of carbon ﬁxation in
Arabidopsis plants with compromised ADT activity. This
corroborates the additional observation that we do not see
overall signiﬁcant biomass differences between wild-type
and adt3/4/5/6 plants. Photorespiration is typically thought
of as a mechanism for a plant to mitigate the acciden-
tal ﬁxation of oxygen instead of CO2. Our data (Fig. 8),
however, show no signiﬁcant difference in the rates of
overall CO2 release between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6.
Since we only detected the overall net release of CO2 from
the plant, we cannot determine whether this CO2 came
from respiration or photorespiration. Future RTAM-MS
focusing on oxygen uptake ﬂux analysis, such as using
18O2, may be an interesting extension of this study to see if
any utilization of starch accumulation results in signiﬁcant
variations in photorespiration rates in the wild type com-
pared with adt3/4/5/6.
CONCLUSION
Our high-throughput phenomics approach allowed
us to visualize small changes in photosynthetic and
growth performance in ADT knockouts. The data estab-
lished that reduced metabolism through Phe, leading to
reductions in the levels of various phenylpropanoids and
other metabolites, has a moderate impact on PET that is
most likely caused by impaired recycling of ADP + Pi.
Additionally, the metabolomic analysis signiﬁcantly
increased our understanding of the effects of ADT mod-
ulation in Arabidopsis, as partial blockage of this crucial
biosynthetic pathway has signiﬁcant and widespread
metabolic effects. We established signiﬁcant reductions in
the contents of several phenylpropanoid-derived metabo-
lites, including ﬂavonoids, lignans, and glucosinolates, at
both harvesting points (44 and 70 DAS). Our metabolomic
analysis also revealed a number of systemic pleiotropic
effects of the genetic manipulations. These effects included
reductions in glucosinolate and phenolic glucoside con-
tents, with related increases in the levels of putative gal-
actolipids and apocarotenoids.
The small impairment of photosynthetic energy con-
version, however, indicates that the metabolic engineering
of lignin biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism
demonstrated here could be a viable strategy to improve,
for example, biofuel crops. Examples exist where only
small changes in photosynthetic performance visible under
controlled greenhouse conditions translate to much more
pronounced effects in ﬁeld-grown plants (Lawson et al.,
2012). A good example is the PsbS knockout mutant (im-
paired in qE) that displays a similar electron transport rate
in the laboratory but signiﬁcantly reduced ﬁtness under
ﬁeld conditions (Külheim et al., 2002). Thus, the small
changes measured in this study may have greater effects in
ﬁeld conditions. This highlights the need in future studies
to assess changes in physiological parameters under both
greenhouse and ﬁeld conditions and to determine to what
extent, if any, plant ﬁtness is compromised. The results of
this study show that engineering one pathway alone may
not be sufﬁcient to improve certain traits. In particular,
further improvements of ATP consumption can be a fol-
low-up approach to make ADT mutants an interesting
model for the improvement of, for example, biofuel con-
version efﬁciencies.

Phenylpropanoid Metabolism and Photosynthesis

and then moved to the phenomics facility. Plants were grown in eight to
12 blocks in four independent sets (Fig. 1, A–C), with each set having a ran-
domized arrangement of genotypes per block. They were monitored in the
phenomics facility for 15 to 30 d after being transferred. Both chambers utilized
a 9-h photoperiod at 200 mmol quanta m–2 s–1 illumination, with daily tem-
peratures of 23°C/21°C (light/dark). Measurements were performed daily,
once in the middle of the photoperiod (day) and once in the middle of the dark
period (night). Measurements were taken by utilizing a movable camera unit,
the Fluorcam XYZ (PSI). This instrument is a mobile, programmable ﬂuores-
cence imaging robot capable of moving throughout the growth chamber on a
gantry, performing automated measurements utilizing blue (455 nm) and red
(618 nm) LEDs to excite ﬂuorescence, with a light intensity of 200 mmol quanta
m2 s–1. Fluorescence was captured by a Fluorcam 2701 LU camera equipped
with a ﬂuorescence ﬁlter. The software then automatically calculates and exports
many parameters, such as Fv/Fm (maximum quantum efﬁciency of PSII photo-
chemistry), FII, NPQ, qE, and qL (fraction of open PSII reaction centers; i.e. with
reduced primary quinone acceptor QA) according to the following formulae:
Fv=Fm ¼ ðFm9-FoÞ=Fm
FðIIÞ ¼ ðFm9-FsÞ=Fm9
NPQ ¼ ðFm-Fm9Þ=Fm9
qE ¼ ðFm-Fm9Þ=Fm9-ðFm-Fm99Þ=Fm99
qL ¼ ððFm9-FsÞ=ðFm9-Fo9ÞÞ∗ðFo=FsÞ
where Fm and Fm9 are maximal ﬂuorescence from NA and DA leaf, respectively;
Fm99 is the maximal ﬂuorescence in the dark after illumination; Fo and Fo9 are
minimal ﬂuorescence from NA and DA leaf, respectively; and Fs is steady-state
ﬂuorescence emission from DA leaf.

DA measurements of photosynthetic parameters were done at the middle of
the light period. The camera carrier moved over the plants with carrier lights on
that matches the light intensity in the growth room. Thus, plants were illumi-
nated all the time. For the NA samples, we used a standard protocol of 3 min that
includes Fm measurements. After 3 min of illumination, photosynthetic pa-
rameters do not change signiﬁcantly (i.e. a steady state is reached).
Measurements in the Flash Spectrometer
Flash spectrometry measurements were performed in a laboratory setting on
wild-type and knockout plants grown in the phenomics facility and harvested
6 weeks after sowing. Plants were adapted to each of the six different light in-
tensities of 70, 120, 200, 300, 500, and 850 mmol quanta m–2 s–1 and then measured
using a DIRK approach. DIRK is used to quantify steady-state electron ﬂuxes
through photosynthesis in light-adapted samples by analyzing the kinetics of the
relaxation of spectroscopic signals (Sacksteder and Kramer, 2000). This relaxation
of spectroscopic signals occurs during short dark intervals that are achieved by
shuttering off the actinic light (Sacksteder and Kramer, 2000).
Minimum ﬂuorescence was determined for 2 s at 2 mmol quanta m–2 s–1, and
Fm and Fm9 were determined with a 0.6-s light pulse at 2,000 mmol quanta m–2 s–1.
The photosynthetic parameters FII and NPQ were calculated as above.
For ECS measurements, plants were preilluminated for 10 min at 100 mmol
quanta m–2 s–1 and then adapted for 2 min to six light intensities (70, 120, 200,
300, 500, and 850 mmol quanta m–2 s–1). For each light intensity, the ECS was
measured as absorption change at 520 nm (Witt, 1979; Bailleul et al., 2010). The
maximal ECS amplitude (reﬂecting the maximal PFM) was determined as the
difference of the 520-nm absorption signal in the light minus the 520-nm signal
in the subsequent dark pulse (arrow in Fig. 5A). This was repeated for all light
intensities (Fig. 5). ECS measurements were tested in the direction of increasing
light intensity followed directly by decreasing light intensities. As no hysteresis
effect was apparent between both directions, measurements were performed
with decreasing light intensities for all genotypes.
ATP and ADP Determination
Wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 mutant plants were dark adapted overnight or taken
from the phenomics facility after 6 h of illumination. Ten leaf discs (with 45.6 mm2
surface area) were harvested from DA and NA plants, pooled in one e-cup, and
shock frozen immediately in liquid N2. Each harvested and frozen plant material
was homogenized in the TissueLyserII (Qiagen) before the addition of 200 mL of
ATP or ADP buffer of the ATP/ADP calorimetric assay kit (BioVision). Samples
were individually sonicated with a Sonicator Microtip (Sonicator S 4000; Branso)
for 3 3 30 s (at 30–50 J) to ensure complete extraction of the aqueous phase from
the leaf discs. After centrifugation, an aliquot (30 mL) of each supernatant was
added to 40 mL of ATP or ADP buffer and mixed with 50 mL of the reaction mix
from either the ATP or ADP kit. The reaction mix contained either the ATP orADP
probe, ATP or ADP converter, and ATP or ADP developer (BioVision). After
30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, each absorption was
measured at 570 and 600 nm to account for the chlorophyll signal. Subtraction of
the chlorophyll signal at 600 nm led to the corrected absorption value at 570 nm
that was used for the calculation of ADP or ATP amount (nmol) using the re-
spective ADP or ATP calibration curve. The calibration curve for ATP was gen-
erated using 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 nmol ﬁnal concentration of the ATP standard. The
calibration curve for ADP was generated using 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 nmol
ﬁnal concentration of the ADP standard. Data were averaged from six to eight
biological replicates per genotype.
Plant Harvesting and Metabolite Extraction
Two sets of Arabidopsis plants were subjected to metabolomics analyses, one at
44 DAS and the second at 70 DAS, where, in each case, leaf tissues from nine in-
dividualplantsofeach genotype werecollected, atthe end of thelight(DA)and dark
(NA) periods, respectively, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Samples were
then freeze dried and kept at 280°C until subjected to solvent extraction. Freeze-
dried samples were weighed (;14–23 mg) and individually ground to ﬁne powder
using the TissueLyserII (Qiagen) for 30 s at a frequency of 30 Hz. Methanol:water
(70:30, v/v) containing 0.05 mM naringenin (Aldrich) as an internal standard was
individually added at a ratio of 1 mL to 50 mg of tissue powder. Samples were
vortexed for a few seconds, sonicated at room temperature for 10 min, vortexed
again, and ﬁnally centrifuged at 16,000g (4°C for 15 min). Supernatants were indi-
vidually transferred to 1.5-mL screw-cap glass vials and stored at 280°C until
analysis. The pellets in each case also were stored at 280°C prior to starch analysis.
UPLC-qTOF-MS Analysis
Metabolite analyses were performed using a Waters Acquity Ultra Perfor-
mance LC system (Waters) equipped with a photodiode array el detector
(Waters) and coupled to a Xevo G2 QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters MS
Technologies) using MassLynx (version 4.1) software. Separation of metabolites
was performed using a BEH C18 column (Waters; 100 3 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 mm
particle size). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water
(phase A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (phase B). The linear gra-
dient program was as follows: 100% A over 0.5 min, 0% to 45% (v/v) B over
25 min, 45% to 100% (v/v) B over 1 min, held at 100% B for a further 3.5 min,
then returned to the initial conditions (100% A) in 0.5 min, followed by
reconditioning at 100% A for 10 min. The ﬂow rate was 0.2 mL min21, with
column temperature kept at 25°C and samples at 5°C. Spectra were recorded
between 200 and 500 nm with a resolution of 1.2 nm. The masses of eluted
compounds were detected using an electrospray ionization source in the neg-
ative ion mode. The following settings were applied: capillary voltage at 2.2 kV,
cone voltage at 20 eV, and collision energy at 6 and 30 eV; argon was used as the
collision gas. For LC-MS/MS analyses (Supplemental Table S2), 5- to 50-, 30-,
and 30- to 60-eV collision energies were used. The m/z range was 50 to 1,000 D.
The mass spectrometer was calibrated using sodium formate, and Leu en-
kephalin was employed as the lock mass. The injection volume was 2 mL for
LC-MS analysis and 4 mL for LC-MS/MS.
Metabolomics Data Processing
Chromatograms obtained from UPLC-photodiode array-qTOF-MS analysis
were inspected visually in MassLynx software (Waters) with obvious outliers
excluded. In order to conduct subsequent data processing, .RAW data ﬁles were
converted to NetCDF using MassLynx’s Databridge software. NetCDF ﬁles
were then processed in RStudio (version 0.9.332) using the package XCMS
(Smith et al., 2006; https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu) for feature (unique mass/
retention time signals, MxxxTxxx) detection and retention time correction,
followed by the CAMERA package (Kuhl et al., 2012; https://bioconductor.
org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html) for features grouping to-
gether and for partial annotation. XCMS-based feature detection and integra-
tion were performed using the Centwave method (Tautenhahn et al., 2008) with
the following parameters: preﬁlter = c(0,0), snthr = 2, ppm = 15, peakwidth =
c(5,20), and nSlaves = 4. Retention time correction was performed twice via the
obiwarp method with the following parameters: bw = 2, minfrac = 0.5, mzwid =
0.015, and plottype = c(‘deviation’). The CAMERA package was used with the
following parameters: perfwhm = 0.6 and groupCorr, ﬁndIsotopes, and ﬁn-
dAdducts with polarity = ‘negative’.
Pairwise comparison in XCMS was conducted after setting the two groups,
one including all wild-type samples (both DA and NA) and one including all
mutant line samples (both DA and NA). After initial XCMS and CAMERA
processing, TSV and CSV ﬁles generated were combined and further analyzed
manually (Supplemental Table S1). Feature lists were normalized to the internal
standard naringenin (integrated in XCMS results as feature M271T1196, Rt
19.93, m/z 271.0608 [calculated 271.0606 for C15H11O5]) for statistical analysis.
Comparisons between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6 (either from DA or NA
plants) were performed separately for the selection of statistically signiﬁcant
features subjected to annotation efforts. Box plots were made using Excel with
the following results obtained: P value (2log10 [P]) and fold change for pairwise
comparison between the wild type and each ADT mutant (NA and DA) and for
NA versus DA in the wild type and each ADT mutant (Supplemental Table S1).
For HCA and PLSDA, data were transformed to zero mean and unit variance.
The annotated features (after the removal of isotopes, adducts, and fragments)
were imported to MeV version 4.8 and subsequently clustered using the fol-
lowing settings for hierarchical clustering: tree selection = gene tree, ordering
optimization = optimize gene leaf order, distance metric selection = optimize
gene leaf order, linkage method selection = average linkage clustering. PLSDA
of NA_wild type, DA_wild type, NA_adt3/4/5/6, and DA_adt3/4/5/6 was per-
formed using DeviumWeb (version 0.4; Grapov, 2014).
Metabolite Identiﬁcation and Annotation
Information obtained from computational processing was used as a starting
point for manual peak identiﬁcation. Metabolites were then identiﬁed by
comparison with standard compounds of their retention time, UV spectra, and
MS/MS fragmentation. Other metabolites were putatively annotated using the
following two approaches: (1) putative molecular formulae calculated from

Starch Quantiﬁcation
Following the extract preparation for metabolomic analyses above, the
corresponding pellets were individually subjected to starch quantiﬁcation. Each
pellet sample was next washed three times with 1 mL of ethanol: water (80:20, v/v)
with sonication at room temperature, followed bycentrifugation at 16,000g,with
solvent discarded. A 0.2 N potassium hydroxide solution in water was then
added to each sample at a ratio of 1 mL to 40 mg of sample (i.e. the freeze-dried
plant material, prior to metabolite extraction), and gelatinization was con-
ducted at 85°C for 45 min. After cooling down to room temperature, acetic acid
(1 N) was added for neutralization at a ratio of 0.2 mL to 40 mg of sample (as
above), and samples were individually vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000g and
25°C for 15 min. Amyloglucosidase solution (A-1602; Sigma) was prepared at
100 units mL–1, and digestion proceeded by adding the solution (40 mL) to each
supernatant (60 mL) and incubating for 15 min at 60°C in a shaking water bath.
Acetonitrile (100 mL) was added immediately to each sample after digestion.
Finally, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000g at 4°C for 15 min.
Supernatants (180 mL) and 10 mg mL–1 Xyl solution (20 mL) were transferred
into screw-cap glass vials and analyzed.
Released Glc was quantiﬁed using an HPLC device (2695; Waters) coupled to
an evaporative light-scattering detector (2424; Waters) equipped with a
Supercosil LC-NH column (250 3 4.6 mm i.d., 5 mm; Supelco). The mobile phase
consisted of acetonitrile: water (75:25, v/v), the ﬂow rate was 0.5 mL min21,
with nebulizer temperature of 70°C and N2 pressure at 50 p.s.i. The injection
volume was 5 mL. Xyl in each sample solution was used as an internal standard.
By using isocratic elution, Xyl and Glc were resolved and eluted at 11.2 and
13.6 min, respectively. A control recovery test was performed using starch
standard powder (S5296; Sigma), giving 100% 6 10% recovery. Calibration
curves for Glc exhibited good polynomial expression, with correlation coefﬁ-
cients of 0.9993 (0.125–0.5 mg mL–1) to 0.9985 (0.5–1.5 mg mL–1). A standard
solution containing 1 mg mL–1 Xyl and 0 to 2 mg mL–1 Glc was used (5-mL
injection volume) to monitor the evaporative light-scattering detection repro-
ducibility throughout the runs.
RTAM-MS of CO2
Wild-type and adt3/4/5/6 plants (56 DAS) were placed in an in-house-built
isolation/exposure chamber (Supplemental Fig. S4) and were sealed. The cham-
ber was made of clear polycarbonate for light penetration and was modiﬁed with
three Swagelock connection ports in the lid to allow air ﬂow in and to control air/
gas ﬂow to a vacuum or to a Shimadzu QP2010 single quad mass spectrometer
with an electron-impact source for analysis. NA plants were kept in the dark for
12 h to consume all starch reserves, and DA plants were kept in the light for 12 h
within an environmental growth chamber to allow for starch accumulation. A
ﬂow rate of 200 mL min–1 was used to initially purge the chamber and to maintain
a constant atmospheric CO2 level throughout each plant acclimation period. The
mass spectrometer was calibrated by running a series of volumetrically prepared
CO2 standards. Data acquisition began with the analysis of just the room air CO2
concentration for 15 min, then a valve was switched and the plants that had ac-
climated for 12 h in either the light (DA) or dark (NA) were analyzed by mea-
suring the air that passes around the plant and that enters the mass spectrometer.
The ﬂow rate of this analysis was set at 2 mL min–1 CO2 concentration and was
monitored over 30 min to allow the CO2 concentration measurement to stabilize
and arrive at a steady state. The average concentration at the last 5 min of the
30-min period was used to calculate the total CO2 concentration of the air plus
what was released or ﬁxed by the plant. Then, the light was either turned on for
the NA plants or turned off for the DA plants, and the CO2 concentration was
allowed to stabilize and reach a steady state for another 50 min. The last 5 min of
this period was used to determine the CO2 released or absorbed under light or
dark conditions in plants depleted of starch (NA) or in which starch accumulated
(DA). After analysis, the aboveground portion of the plant was dried and weighed
to normalize the measurements to dry weight. Plantless pots with soil also were
evaluated under the same conditions. CO2 levels attributed to release from the soil
and room atmosphere were subtracted from the experimental CO2 measurements
to obtain the levels attributed to just the plant.
