doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00014.2009.—We developed a new model
of hypodynamic loading to support mice in chronic conditions of
partial weight bearing, enabling simulations of reduced gravity envi-
ronments and related clinical conditions. The novel hardware allows
for reduced loading between 10 and 80% of normal body weight on all
four limbs and enables characteristic quadrupedal locomotion. Ten-
week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were supported for 21 days under
Mars-analog suspension (38% weight bearing) and compared with
age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) controls. After an
initial adaptation, weight gain did not differ between groups, suggest-
ing low levels of animal stress. Relative to age-matched controls, mice
exposed to Mars-analog loading had signiﬁcantly lower muscle mass
(23% gastrocnemius wet mass, P  0.0001); trabecular and cortical
bone morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: 24% at the distal
femur, and cortical thickness: 11% at the femoral midshaft, both
P  0.001); and biomechanical properties of the femoral midshaft
(i.e., 27% ultimate moment, P  0.001). Bone formation indexes
were decreased compared with age-matched full-weight-bearing mice,
whereas resorption parameters were largely unchanged. Singly
housed, full-weight-bearing controls with forelimb jackets were
largely similar to age-matched, group-housed controls, although a few
variables differed and warrant further investigation. Altogether, these
data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial
weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to
reduced loading environments.
mice; unloading; disuse osteoporosis; partial weightbearing; space-
ﬂight
MUSCULOSKELETAL DECONDITIONING associated with spaceﬂight
has been noted since the early days of the Gemini program.
Despite rigorous exercise protocols and other countermeasures,
negative calcium balance (0.5%/mo) and bone loss in
weight-bearing bones (1.0–2.7%/mo) are still the hallmarks of
ﬂight (12–15, 29). Although the mechanisms of disuse-induced
bone loss and age-related bone loss are not identical, a 20%
decline in femoral neck bone mineral density during a single
year of spaceﬂight corresponds to 30 yr of age-related bone
loss in a postmenopausal woman, bringing with it a signiﬁcant
increase in fracture risk (16). Furthermore, subject-speciﬁc
ﬁnite-element analyses indicate that femoral bone strength
declines by 2%/mo during spaceﬂight, with some astronauts
exhibiting reductions in proximal femoral strength that are
comparable to estimated lifetime losses in bone strength asso-
ciated with aging (11).
Whereas human spaceﬂight over the last 30 yr has been
conﬁned exclusively to low Earth orbit, and largely to ﬂights of
less than 6 mo, exploration goals once again reach beyond the
Van Allen belts. Although the physiological effects of weight-
lessness are well described, the effects of chronic partial
weight bearing, such as expected on the moon (16% of Earth’s
gravity) and Mars (38% of Earth’s gravity), have yet to be
quantiﬁed. In these environments, the risks of musculoskeletal
atrophy and accompanying orthopedic injury are uncertain, and
methods to further investigate adaptations to partial weight
bearing are needed.
Based on the paradigm that mechanical loading provides the
primary stimulus for skeletal maintenance (4, 10, 24), it is
likely that partial weight bearing will provide some prophy-
laxis against the deconditioning seen in conditions of full
disuse. But how do adaptive processes scale with changes in
gravitational loading? Does a given decrease in gravitational
acceleration lead to a proportionate decrease in bone and
muscle mass, or is this response curve nonlinear? The answers
to these questions are important, not only for aerospace phys-
iology, but also for a better understanding of the effects of
reduced weight bearing associated with clinical conditions and
diseases.
Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to develop a
new rodent model of partial weight suspension (PWS) to
explore these musculoskeletal effects of chronically reduced
weight bearing and to conduct the ﬁrst study of musculoskel-
etal adaptation to Mars gravity levels. We hypothesized that
musculoskeletal adaptation to partial weight bearing would
replicate the key features of adaptation to full unloading,
including reduced bone formation rate, muscle mass, bone
mass, and bone strength.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We ﬁrst describe the development of the PWS system and then
detail an in vivo study with mice exposed to Mars-analog loading.
Description of PWS system. The PWS system draws on design
elements developed for human research in partial weight-bearing
locomotion, coupling them with lessons learned over 3 decades of
rodent suspension (2, 18, 22). Developed for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) in 1979, classic hindlimb or tail
suspension utilizes tail traction and hindquarter elevation to fully
unload the animal’s rear limbs, while the forelimbs remain weight
bearing and support locomotion. Bone loss and muscle atrophy

accompany this disuse, providing a good model for studying the
effects of, and countermeasures to, spaceﬂight and other disuse.
However, the model is not readily extensible to loading conditions
between normal and full unloading.
The PWS system was designed, and veriﬁed in testing, to 1) support mice
in partial weight-bearing quadrupedal loading for periods of at least 3
wk; 2) be tunable to within 5% of a desired hypodynamic stimulus
between 10 and 80% weight bearing; 3) provide an environment that
minimizes stress to the animals, as measured by body mass changes;
4) support movement, cleaning, and feeding; and 5) allow for full
recovery to facilitate reloading studies.
All experimental protocols were approved by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals
were singly housed in specially developed habitats derived from
designs of NASA Ames Research Center and Cornell University (18).
The living volumes were 12-in. polycarbonate cubes, with wooden
feet supporting the corners and removable perforated ﬂoors that
passively minimized waste buildup. Sitting atop the cages, an alumi-
num channel provided a rigid base for suspension hardware (Fig. 1A).
A steel rod supported a small nylon wheel and low-friction bearing to
provide linear freedom of motion for the suspended animals.
In contrast to previous models (25), we opted for a quadrupedal
suspension design to help preserve normal gait characteristics and
loading patterns. A full-body suspension design was developed
around the traditional Morey-Holton tail suspension model and pre-
vious whole body harness models (19, 25). A “second-skin” bandage
of Tegaderm or SteriStrip (3M, St. Paul, MN) was loosely wrapped at
the base of the tail to prevent irritation, and a small piece of athletic
tape secured the tail to the harness. The forelimbs were supported by
a ﬂexible, breathable “jacket” of athletic tape and soft moleskin,
secured by Velcro under isoﬂurane anesthesia. Several pilot studies
resulted in the optimization of the jacket design, allowing the jacketed
mice to demonstrate feeding, grooming, sleeping, exploring, and other
appropriate daily activities. As seen in Fig. 1B, the harness and tail
wrap were connected by an adjustable bead chain and spaced by a
hollow metal rod to distribute loading.
A previously published system that supported partial weight bear-
ing on the forelimbs with unloaded hindlimbs relied on a complex
active feedback system to provide frequency-tuned loading (25). We
opted instead to focus on adjusting peak loading levels with minimum
complexity. Thus we implemented a passive suspension design using
a low-modulus plastic-coated spring (k  1.6 N/m; S0101 coil cord,
Statico, San Carlos, CA). Twisting the spring through its support
engaged a variable number of coils, N, thereby changing the spring
constant proportional to 1/N. Small swivels prevented spring bind-up,
and a plastic lid secured above the animal inhibited climbing. Total
mass of the suspension element was 14 g, which was fully supported
under static conditions and did not contribute to the standing mass of
the animal.
Daily weighing of suspended animals quantiﬁed the static loads
experienced during quiet standing. True body masses were ﬁrst
obtained by brieﬂy hanging the animal on a specially designed rig
positioned over a scale, so as to avoid full weight bearing (18).
Titrated weight bearing, expressed throughout as effective body mass,
was then measured with the animal standing in quadrupedal PWS on
the same scale (Fig. 1B). Adjustments to spring tension were made as
necessary to accommodate changes in body mass and spring stiffness.
Ground reaction force measurement. To quantify the dynamic
loading environment of PWS, a high-precision three-axis force plate
(HE-6x6-1 AccuSway Force Plate, AMTI Measurements, Watertown,
MA) was used to measure ground reaction forces (GRF) during active
locomotion. A plywood platform was built over the plate to provide a
level walking surface, with a 2-cm-wide strip of plywood atop the
force plate as a local load sensor, as described by Zumwalt et al. (33).
The platform was covered with cloth tape to improve traction, and
mice locomoted freely over the surface. GRFs were collected in three
orthogonal directions: X (nose to tail), Y (mediolateral), and Z (verti-
cal). Signals were ﬁltered with a two-pole, low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter
with a corner frequency of 25 Hz (MATLAB ﬁlter routine, The
Mathworks, Natick, MA). Peak forces were identiﬁed in all three direc-
tions. The rate of force onset was estimated as the slope of the initial
portion of the GRF rise. Stance duration and area under the force
curve were also calculated.
Trials were conducted with and without a forelimb vest, and under
PWS at 16, 38, and/or 60% weight bearing. Traces were selected for
analysis whenever a single forelimb made unobstructed contact with
the local load sensor strip. In most cases, this ﬁrst forelimb footfall
was immediately followed by the ipsilateral hindlimb. All evaluated
impacts were conﬁrmed with video footage. Data were gathered from
a single female mouse (10 wk old, BALB/cByJ) for internal consis-
tency and includes pairs of footfalls from normal gait (n  4),
jacketed gait (n  5), and suspension at 60% (n  5), 38% (Mars,
n  4), and 16% (Lunar, n  11 forelimb, 3 hindlimb) weight bearing.
Design of Mars-analog weight-bearing study. Ten-week-old fe-
male nulliparous BALB/cByJ mice were obtained from Jackson
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). This age was chosen to take advan-

tage of the plateau in longitudinal femoral growth, which is more
representative of the adult human skeleton, and a near maximum in
trabecular bone volume (5, 6), which improves the likelihood of
visualizing changes in this compartment.
Animals were randomly assigned to four groups: Baseline (killed at
start, n  8), Age-matched (killed at end, n  21 to provide additional
statistical power), Mars (38% weight bearing, n  10), and Jacket
controls (100% weight bearing, n  13). Baseline and Age groups
were group-housed in standard laboratory vivarium caging with ad
libitum access to both food and water. Mars animals were singly
housed, harnessed, and suspended at 38% weight bearing for 21 days.
Jacket control animals were similarly harnessed and singly housed in
experimental cages, but remained fully weight bearing for the 21-day
experiment. Before the start of the experiment, Mars and Jacket mice
underwent a 2-day period of adaptation to the forelimb harnesses.
Food and water access were provided ad libitum in Mars, Age, and
Baseline groups, whereas Jacket mice were pair-fed, according to the
previous day’s average of the Mars cohort. Daily care, weighing, and
adjustment of spring tension were provided to all animals as described
above. One Mars mouse was removed from the study due to self-
inﬂicted tail injury. Two Jacket animals were removed due to exces-
sive weight loss caused by failure to adapt to the harnesses. Four
additional mice (1 Age, 3 Jacket) were removed due to complications
arising from a prestudy blood draw.
Intraperitoneal injections of calcein (0.05 ml, 12 mg calcein/ml of
2% saline-bicarbonate solution, 30 mg/kg) were given at 10 and 2
days before death to label newly forming bone. Following death by
carbon dioxide inhalation, the gastrocnemius muscles were weighed.
Femurs, tibiae, and humerii were harvested bilaterally from all study
animals. Left side bones were prepared for imaging and biomechani-
cal testing in gauze soaked in normal saline (0.9%), then stored at
20°C. Right side bones were prepared for histology in 10% neutral
buffered formalin at 4°C for 48–72 h, then transferred to 70% ethanol,
and returned to refrigeration.
Bone microarchitecture. Trabecular and cortical bone microarchi-
tecture were assessed using high-resolution microcomputed tomogra-
phy (CT40; Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland), as previously
described (5). Brieﬂy, the distal femoral metaphysis and femoral
midshaft were scanned using a 12-m isotropic voxel size. Morpho-
metric parameters were computed using a direct three-dimensional
approach that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying
structure. For the cancellous bone region, we assessed bone volume
fraction [bone volume per total volume (BV/TV), %], trabecular
thickness (m), trabecular separation (m), trabecular number
(mm1), connectivity density (mm3), and structure model index. For
the cortical regions at the distal femoral metaphysis and femoral
midshaft, we measured the total cross-sectional area, cortical bone
area (BA), medullary area (all mm2), and cortical thickness (Ct.Th;
m). The maximum, minimum, and polar (all mm4) moments of
inertia were also measured at the femoral midshaft.
Biomechanical assessment. Following CT scanning, the strength
of the femoral midshaft was assessed by 3-point bending. Specimens
were thawed to room temperature in physiological saline to ensure
adequate hydration, then placed posterior surface downward on a
6-mm span. A low-force mechanical testing system (MTS Bionix 200,
with 100 N load cell, MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) was used to
apply a ﬂexion moment to the midpoint of the anterior diaphysis. A
preload of 1–2 N was applied, followed by a constant displacement
rate of 0.03 mm/s until failure. Force-displacement data were acquired
at 100 Hz and used to determine structural properties (moment at
yield, ultimate moment, bending stiffness, and postyield work). Bend-
ing rigidity for each specimen was normalized by the minimum
moment of inertia, as measured on the CT scans, to derive an
estimated elastic modulus. Three specimens (one Age and two Mars)
were removed due to technical errors during the mechanical testing.
Histomorphometry. Following CT, the ﬁve tibiae in each group
nearest to the median value for trabecular bone volume fraction were
selected for histomorphometry, then processed using previously de-
scribed methods (26). Un-decalciﬁed thin sections (4 m) were
prepared and stained with toluidine blue or left unstained. A standard
histomorphometric analysis of the proximal tibial metaphysis was
performed (OsteoMeasure analysis system, OsteoMetrics, Decatur,
GA) in a 1.28-mm2 area starting 0.3 mm distal from the growth plate.
Histomorphometry methods, variables, and nomenclature conform to
those recommended by the American Society for Bone and Mineral
Research (23).
Data analysis. To examine the effect of aging during the study, we
compared Age mice to Baseline mice using unpaired t-tests. To
examine the differences between Age, Jacket, and Mars groups, we
utilized an ANOVA with Fisher’s paired least signiﬁcant difference
for post hoc comparisons. Differences were considered signiﬁcant
when P  0.05.
RESULTS
GRFs. For each of the 21 days of the study, static values of
effective body mass were set within 1 g of the desired weight-
bearing level (mean error  4.1  1.0% true body mass).
Average drift overnight was 0.5 g (2.5  4.9% true body
mass). Static weight bearing at the beginning and end of each
day remained within 5% of target levels on 77% of study days,
deviating 10% from desired weight bearing on 2% of all
study days.
During locomotion, peak dynamic GRFs in the vertical
direction were reduced 25 and 14% in the forelimbs and
hindlimbs, respectively, by application of the jacket, suggest-
ing a relative unweighting of the forelimbs due to the restric-
tions of the forelimb vest. Compared with full weight bearing,
Mars weight bearing reduced the mean peak vertical GRF at
self-selected walking speeds by 64% in the forelimbs and 85%
in the hindlimbs, while Lunar weight bearing reduced mean
peak vertical GRF at self-selected walking speeds by 75% in
the forelimbs and 85% in the hindlimbs (P  0.001 for all
relative to full weight bearing, Fig. 2, Table 1).
Suspension also sharply reduced the rate of onset of vertical
GRFs in both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs (Table 1). For
example, with Mars suspension, the rate of vertical force onset

was 73 and 92% lower than with full weight bearing in the
forelimbs and hindlimbs, respectively. Stance duration was
also signiﬁcantly higher in suspended animals. Although the
absolute magnitude of transverse GRFs (GRFx and GRFy) was
lower in suspension, the ratio of each of these in-plane forces
to vertical GRFz tended to be larger, particularly in the hind-
limb.
Body mass and food intake. Following 2 days of adaptation
to the forelimb jackets, there were no signiﬁcant differences in
initial body mass across the groups (mean  20.5  1.2 g).
Food usage for Mars animals decreased sharply at the time of
suspension, stabilizing between days 6 and 7. Consistent with
this, Mars animals lost 6.5  2.7% of their body mass during
the ﬁrst week (P  0.0001 relative to Age controls, zz). In
weeks 2 and 3, there were no signiﬁcant differences in main-
tenance of body mass between Age and Mars groups, suggest-
ing that stress levels had normalized.
Unexpected weight gain was seen in the jacketed control
animals (Jacket), who experienced caloric restriction in the ﬁrst
week of the study, while being pair fed to match the Mars
animals (Fig. 3). After an initial decline in both food consump-
tion and body mass, the Jacket animals experienced a rapid
increase in body mass, showing signiﬁcantly higher weight
gain in weeks 2 and 3 (11  5%) than Age or Mars animals
(both 2  1%, P  0.001), resulting in a ﬁnal Jacket body mass
signiﬁcantly higher than both Mars and Age controls (Fig. 3).
Muscle mass. Compared with Baseline values, Age animals
had greater muscle mass. Mars animals had 20–23% lower
gastrocnemius muscle wet mass than Jacket and Age controls
(Table 2). Gastrocnemius mass normalized to body mass was
also signiﬁcantly lower for Mars animals relative to Age
controls (13%, P  0.04). Despite their weight gain, Jacket
animals did not show increased gastrocnemius wet mass com-
pared with Age controls, either absolute or weight normalized.
Bone microarchitecture by CT. Compared with Baseline
values, Age animals had decreased trabecular bone volume and
a relative maintenance of cortical parameters (Table 2). Tra-
becular and cortical bone microarchitecture were further dete-
riorated in Mars animals compared with both Age and Jacket
controls (Table 2). In the distal femoral metaphysis, trabecular
BV/TV was 24% less in Mars than Age (P  0.0001, Table 2),
whereas there was no difference in trabecular number or
separation. Rather, BV/TV losses were driven by a signiﬁcant
trabecular thinning, leading to a shift in the structural model
index toward rodlike geometry.
At the femoral midshaft, Mars mice had a smaller cross-
sectional area and area moments of inertia than Age controls
(Table 2). Ct.Th and cortical BA at both the midshaft and the
distal femoral metaphysis were also signiﬁcantly lower in Mars
than in Age controls. Similar results were seen for Mars
animals relative to Jacket, with signiﬁcantly smaller moments
of inertia in the femoral midshaft, as well as reduced Ct.Th and
BA in both the femoral midshaft and distal metaphysis.
Biomechanical properties. In Mars mice, the morphometric
changes described above were associated with signiﬁcant dec-

rements in biomechanical properties relative to Age-matched
controls, as demonstrated by three-point bending to failure
(Table 3). Failure (or ultimate) moment was 27% lower in
Mars samples relative to Age controls (P  0.0002). Bending
stiffness and moment at yield were also signiﬁcantly lower in
Mars animals relative to Age controls (P  0.05). When
structural biomechanical properties were normalized to area
moments of inertia, the resulting estimated Young’s modulus
did not differ signiﬁcantly between Mars and Age groups,
suggesting that changes in biomechanical properties were due
primarily to geometric changes.
Despite their similarities in morphology, the biomechanical
properties of Jacket femurs were weaker than those of Age
controls, and did not differ from those of Mars animals, with
the exception of a lower estimated Young’s modulus in Jacket
specimens.
Histology. Baseline animals had higher bone formation pa-
rameters than Age-controls (who were 3 wk older), including
signiﬁcantly increased mineral apposition rate, osteoid surface,
and number of osteoblasts (Table 4). At the end of the study,
compared with Age-matched controls, Mars animals had re-
duced indexes of bone formation, including signiﬁcantly less
mineralizing surface (per bone surface), and osteoid surface
(per bone surface) (Table 4). Mars animals had lower oste-
oclast numbers compared with Age-matched controls. This
observation, along with no differences in eroded surface, sug-
gests unchanged or slightly lower rates of bone resorption in
Mars animals. Jacket animals had signiﬁcantly less mineraliz-
ing surface than Age controls, and more osteoclasts and osteoid
surface than the Mars specimens.
DISCUSSION
Our ﬁrst objective was to develop a new rodent model of
PWS to explore the musculoskeletal effects of chronically
reduced weight bearing. In keeping with the key functional
requirements outlined earlier, this study successfully demon-
strated extended quadrupedal partial weight bearing at tunable
levels, while minimizing animal stress and adequately support-
ing characteristic animal behaviors. While not shown here,
other studies by our group showed that mice removed from the
PWS system after suspension were immediately able to return
to full weight bearing.
More speciﬁcally, the design of our hardware and experi-
mental methods ensured that average static loads were propor-
tionally reduced relative to the degree of animal suspension.
Daily weighing and titration of effective weight allowed for
tight control of these chronic loads, generally to well within
5% of desired weight-bearing levels.

PARTIAL WEIGHT SUSPENSION: A MURINE MODEL

Force platform measurements of locomotor GRFs demon-
strated that peak GRFs and force onset (i.e., strain rate) were
lower for suspension animals than controls. The reductions in
peak force were somewhat larger than predicted simply by the
level of suspension, perhaps due to effects of dynamic loco-
motion and/or the independent effects of forelimb harnessing.
Whereas jackets alone led to more equal weight sharing be-
tween the forelimbs and hindlimbs, suspension gaits tended to
favor the forelimbs.
Observed increases in the ratio of transverse to vertical
GRFs suggest a greater relative need for stabilization in partial
weight-bearing animals, despite the moderating presence of
harness forces. Such increased expenditure for postural stabil-
ity is consistent with human studies of partial weight-bearing
locomotion (21).
Some caution is warranted in interpreting gait data, as
variable locomotor speeds were adopted under the different
weight-bearing conditions. Across trials, suspended animals
adopted a signiﬁcantly lower average speed (10.98  4.77
cm/s) than nonsuspended animals (38.69  17.22 cm/s, P 
0.0001). Because peak force increases with decreasing stance
time (1), it is, therefore, likely that our data underestimate the
amount of peak force reduction that might be observed in a
speed-matched trial. A variety of changes in gait kinematics
and dynamics have been seen in prior studies of human partial
weight bearing and may well be expected under true partial
gravity conditions (21, 22). Like these studies, our data do not
show linear reductions in peak vertical GRFs during walking,
but they are representative of free gait for each of our exper-
imental conditions and should be characteristic of the actual
peak forces observed during daily living for each group.
Additionally, all locomotor data were acquired in an animal
newly adapted to suspension. Future studies should investigate
whether there are additional differences associated with neu-
romuscular adaptation or disuse-induced muscle loss following
chronic exposure to partial weight bearing.
Our second objective was to use our partial weight-bearing
system to conduct the ﬁrst study of adaptation to Mars gravity
levels. We found that 3 wk of Mars analog loading was well
tolerated and led to signiﬁcant musculoskeletal deterioration
relative to age-matched controls.
We utilized 10-wk-old BALB/cByJ female mice, as this is
an age when longitudinal growth and body mass gains are
minimal. Moreover, at this age, trabecular bone volume is at
near maximal levels (5, 6), which mimics peak bone mass of
most astronauts and which optimized our ability to detect
declines in trabecular bone. Compared with the Baseline group,
normally weight-bearing Age controls had decreased trabecu-
lar bone volume, but increased cortical thickness at the femoral
diaphysis, which was accompanied by signiﬁcant increases in
stiffness. Additional studies are needed to determine whether
age inﬂuences the musculoskeletal adaptation to partial weight
bearing, as has been suggested for hindlimb suspension (27).
Corticosterone and other systemic stress hormones are
known to be catabolic to both muscle and bone. In tail-
suspension studies, body mass has been established as a gross
surrogate marker for chronic systemic stress (17). The weight
loss in the Mars-analog and jacketed control animals during the
ﬁrst week of suspension suggests a brief period of increased
stress and adaptation to the experimental environment, due to
some combination of environmental or feeding effects, not
simply suspension. However, the return of normal growth rates
in Mars animals in weeks 2 and 3, and the accompanying
stabilization of food consumption, suggest that systemic stress
due to the experimental treatment is negligible after the initial
adaptive period. Similar results have been seen in centrifuge
studies (30, 31) and tail-suspension experiments (32). In future
PWS studies, characterization of corticosterone levels could
provide a more sensitive stress proﬁle. Additional cohorts
killed during the study for histomorphometry could also clarify
if this transient is associated with changes in bone resorption,
which may be obscured in our poststudy measures.
As noted, jacketed but fully weight-bearing mice experi-
enced an unexpected increase in body mass, showing signiﬁ-
cantly higher weight gain in the second and third weeks of the
study compared with either age-matched or Mars-analog ani-
mals. This weight gain was not correlated with additional
longitudinal bone growth or muscle gain in the gastrocnemius,
suggesting a shift in body composition toward higher fat
content or muscular hypertrophy elsewhere in the body.
Caloric restriction in mice results in signiﬁcantly decreased
resting metabolic rate and reductions in energy expenditures
from exercise (7). Weight gain in calorically restricted animals
is largely due to increases in adipose body fraction, while lean
mass changes are curtailed relative to controls. If the pair-fed
jacketed animals adopted a reduced metabolic rate during
caloric restriction, then returned to normal consumption levels,
weight gain and increasing body fat may have been expected.

PARTIAL WEIGHT SUSPENSION: A MURINE MODEL

Future studies should incorporate longitudinal measures of
body composition to resolve this open question. Additionally,
activity levels may vary between groups and should be moni-
tored in future studies to better differentiate the impact of this
variable on key outcomes.
Due to the sharp body mass increase in Jacket controls and
the strong relationship between musculoskeletal parameters
and body mass (3), we focused our analysis on the comparison
between Mars and Age animals, which had similar body
weights. Patterns of bone loss were generally consistent with
previous reports from tail-suspension experiments, with greater
losses in the trabecular compartment than cortical, and sharper
reductions in bone formation than resorption, as observed at
the end of the study.
While we believe the predominant effects of PWS are due to
differences in weight bearing, a few observations (i.e., femoral
biomechanics and tibial histology) taken at the end of the
experiment
showing
differences
between
jacketed,
fully
weight-bearing mice and age-matched controls suggest that the
musculoskeletal response may have been inﬂuenced by the
experimental conditions themselves. There are several factors
that may have contributed to these observations. First, Jacket
mice were singly housed, whereas Age-matched controls were
group housed. This is relevant, as singly housed mice have
been shown to have lower whole body bone mass relative to
group-housed mice (20). Second, jacketed mice were pair fed
to Mars consumption levels and thus calorie restricted relative
to age-matched controls. Finally, jacketed mice were restrained
slightly by the jacket and exhibited altered gait compared with
unjacketed controls. Altogether, these factors may have con-
tributed to the differences between age-matched and jacketed
animals. Further studies with additional control groups (i.e.,
singly housed, no jacket), larger group sizes, and alternate time
points are needed to delineate the effects of weight-bearing
status vs. experimental conditions.
Mice exposed to partial weight bearing exhibited several
physiological changes consistent with those previously re-
ported in hindlimb suspension studies, including decreased
muscle and bone mass and reduced bone formation indexes.
Compared with a previously published study of hindlimb
suspension in female mice of the same genetic background,
both cortical and trabecular bone losses in Mars animals were
less than those previously reported for this mouse strain (9).
However, we note that this observation was made by compar-
ing studies conducted in different laboratories, and, although
provocative, it is clear that additional studies are needed to
provide direct comparisons of the musculoskeletal adaptations
to various partial weight-bearing and full unloading environ-
ments. In particular, the addition of a tail-suspension control to
future studies of partial weight bearing will enable researchers
to better explore the potentially osteoprotective effects of
partial weight bearing in contrast to full unloading and the role
of ﬂuid shift in these changes.
Our model of reduced gravitational loading is subject to
many of the limitations common to all ground-based models of
partial weight bearing. In particular, suspension forces are
localized at the harness points, while normal Earth gravity acts
on the distributed masses of the limbs. Suspension hardware
somewhat limits the animals’ range of motion, particularly in
the spine, and is not tolerated well by all animals. Experience
in harnessing and suspending is necessary to minimize mor-
bidity.
There is some variation of upward force across the gait cycle
due to small displacements of the animal’s center of mass
during normal locomotion. Furthermore, sensorimotor changes
expected in true reduced-gravity environments due to altered
vestibular inputs are not present. However, our data indicate
that the PWS system is able to model chronic conditions of
reduced dynamic loading of the musculoskeletal system, pro-
viding a valuable tool for investigations in this area. Selection
of an appropriate control depends on experimental objectives,
but should account for the effects of single housing in novel
cage structures without bedding. Data presented here suggest
that application of a forelimb jacket in fully weight-bearing
animals may have side effects of increased weight gain and
alterations in gait. Further study is required to understand the
origin and impacts of these changes.
Traditional tail suspension studies utilize a 30° head-down
suspension to provide normal loads to the forelimbs without
excessive tension on the tail (8). However, while notable
cephalic ﬂuid shift and the diuresis it engenders are typical of
human ﬂight responses, the magnitude is excessive relative to
actual ﬂight responses in small quadrupeds (28). Thus our
model, which does not cause ﬂuid shift, may, in fact, more
accurately represent rodent spaceﬂight changes.
In conclusion, we have presented a novel approach to
ground studies of chronic partial weight bearing that is exten-
sible to a wide range of loading regimes, including studies of
interventions and reloading. Three weeks of Mars-analog load-
ing showed decreased muscle mass, along with deterioration of
both cortical and trabecular bone relative to controls. Further
studies are needed to explore whether there is a threshold of
loading beyond which such skeletal degradation slows appre-
ciably, offering key insights into countermeasures against bone
loss in spaceﬂight, bed rest, and other catabolic states. Such
studies would have direct relevance for human spaceﬂight, as
well as clinical conditions of reduced musculoskeletal loading
due to disease, injury, or inactivity.
