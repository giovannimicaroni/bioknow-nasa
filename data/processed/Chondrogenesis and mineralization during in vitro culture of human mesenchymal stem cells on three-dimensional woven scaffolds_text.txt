Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) scaf-
folds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and
medium additives can individually and interactively inﬂuence the structure, composition, mechanical, and
molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(e-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs
were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/
or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chon-
drogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the
newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan,
hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and
medium additives, with signiﬁcant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical
properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young’s, and shear moduli of 0.15,
0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone
formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa1)/
Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium
produced limited osteogenesis. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and
regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying
scaffold. These ﬁndings merit consideration when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair.
Introduction
A
rticular cartilage possesses a complex, zonal ar-
chitecture that enables smooth articulation at the joint
surface and rigid attachment to the subchondral bone. Since
bone-to-bone interfaces are known to integrate better and
faster than cartilage-to-bone interfaces, tissue-engineered os-
teochondral constructs are a promising technique for articu-
lar cartilage repair.1,2 Indeed, various composite grafts have
been explored for osteochondral tissue regeneration utiliz-
ing a variety of cell-seeded scaffolds, including hyaluronan
sponges with calcium phosphate supports,3 nonwoven
poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) meshes with collagen-hydroxyap-
atite supports,4 three-dimensional (3D) printed poly(lactic-co-
glycolic acid)/poly(lactide) scaffolds with poly(lactic-co-
glycolic acid)/tricalcium phosphate supports,5 agarose gels
with devitalized trabecular bones,6 and collagen gels with
hydroxyapatite supports.7
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a promis-
ing cell source for osteochondral tissue engineering, due to
their multilineage differentiation potential.8,9 Moreover, dy-
namic interaction between intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic
(i.e., chemical, mechanical, and temporal) factors determine
the developmental fate of hMSCs10,11 and tissue-engineered
constructs.12,13 Appropriate control of these factors may lead
to favorable outcomes in osteochondral tissue engineering.

The present work describes cartilage and bone tissue engi-
neering using hMSCs and a 3D woven scaffold that we re-
cently developed.14
Poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) was selected as the scaffold
material because it degrades relatively slowly15 and pos-
sesses an appropriately high bulk stiffness to facilitate MSC
differentiation toward skeletal lineages.16 In our recent
in vitro study17 chondrogenesis and mechanical functionality
were clearly evident for 21-day constructs made from hMSCs
embedded in Matrigel and cultured statically on 3D woven
PCL scaffolds, with average aggregate and Young’s moduli
(HA of 0.37 MPa and E of 0.41 MPa, respectively) approach-
ing values reported for normal articular cartilage (HA of 0.1–
2.0 MPa; E of 0.4–0.8 MPa).18–20
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that culture
duration and medium additives can individually and inter-
actively inﬂuence structure, composition, biomechanics, and
gene expression in engineered skeletal tissues generated us-
ing hMSCs and 3D woven PCL scaffolds. On the basis of our
recent ﬁnding that static culture supported chondrogenesis
in this in vitro model,17 all constructs in the present study
were cultured statically. We selected to seed the PCL scaf-
folds with hMSC mixed in a type I collagen gel such that gel
entrapment enhanced cell seeding efﬁciency and helped to
maintain spherical cell morphology for promotion of chon-
drogenesis.21 In one group of constructs, the medium was
supplemented with soluble molecular mediators associated
with chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs (i.e., trans-
forming growth factor [TGF]-b, insulin, and dexametha-
sone),22 whereas in the other group the medium contained
additives associated with osteogenic differentiation (i.e., se-
rum, b-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone).23 Properties
of the resulting engineered tissues were assessed at multiple
levels at culture days 1, 21, and 45.
Materials and Methods
Construct preparation and cultivation
All cell culture reagents were obtained from InVitrogen or
Sigma, unless otherwise speciﬁed. The hMSCs were derived
from bone marrow aspirates obtained from a healthy, mid-
dle-aged adult man with informed consent according to
an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol at Case
Western Reserve University. Before seeding on PCL scaf-
folds, the hMSCs were expanded by *10-fold during a
single passage in which cells were plated at 5500 cells/cm2
and cultured in basic medium (Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/mL of ﬁbro-
blast growth factor-2; Peprotech).
The 3D woven scaffold was made from PCL yarn (24mm
diameter per ﬁlament; 44 ﬁlaments/yarn, Grilon KE-60; EMS/
Griltech). In brief, 11 in-plane layers aligned perpendicularly in
the warp (x) and weft (y) directions were interlocked by a third
set of yarns running in the z direction using a custom-built
loom.14 The roughly 1.4-mm-thick scaffolds had porosity of
61% 0.2%, and approximate pore dimensions of 330260
100 mm. One million P2 hMSCs were mixed with 30 mL of 0.6%
(w/v) type I collagen gel (BD Biosciences), and the resulting
mixture was pipetted onto each PCL scaffold (7-mm-diameter,
1.3-mm-thick discs). The dry scaffolds readily absorbed the
cell–hydrogel mixture and the initial distribution of cells
throughout scaffolds appeared to be relatively uniform, as in
our recent report,17 and therefore we did not elect to use the
vacuum manifold setup described in other reports.14,24
The resulting constructs were placed in 12-well plates (one
construct per well), incubated for 1.5 h at 378C in a humidiﬁed,
5% CO2/room air incubator to allow collagen gelation, and
then 2 mL of differentiation medium was added to each
well. Two experimental groups were compared: (1) a chon-
drogenic group, in which basic medium was supplemented
with 10 ng/mL recombinant human TGF-b3 (Peprotech), 1%
insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITSþ) premix (BD Biosciences),
100 nM
dexamethasone
(Sigma),
82 mg/L
ascorbic-2-
phosphate, 0.4 mM proline, 0.1mM nonessential amino acids,
and 1 M HEPES buffer, and (2) an osteogenic group, in which
basic medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 10 mM b-glycerophosphate, 100 nM dexamethasone,
and 50 mg/mL ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. Culture media
were completely replaced every 2–3 days, and constructs
were harvested at culture day 1, 21, or 45. For 21- and 45-day
constructs, the differentiating medium was replaced with
serum-free medium 24 h before harvest, and the constructs
were rinsed at the time of harvest. The constructs were
not intentionally moved during the culture; however, they
may have been inadvertently ﬂipped over during medium
replacement.
Construct analyses
Samples for histology (n ¼ 2 per group) were formalin
ﬁxed, parafﬁn embedded, and sectioned to 5 mm.17 Histolo-
gical stains included hematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s tri-
chrome, safranin-O/fast green, and alizarin red at Histoserv.
Immunohistochemical stains included collagen types I and
II; these markers were assessed individually, similar to our
previous description.17 Apoptosis staining was done using a
TACS 2 TdT-DAB in situ detection kit (Trevigen). Samples
for microcomputerized tomography (1–2 per group) were
formalin ﬁxed, immersed in 70% ethanol, and loaded into a
microCT 40 system (Scanco Medical). Medium-resolution
scans were obtained in 16 mm increments at energy of 45 kVp
and intensity of 177 mA. Three-dimensional reconstructions
were obtained using accompanying commercial software
(Scanco). Amounts of DNA, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), and
ortho-hydroxyproline (OHP) were measured on papain-
digested samples (n ¼ 3 per group), as previously de-
scribed.17 Construct amounts of calcium were measured
(n ¼ 3 per group) using a commercial assay (Pointe Scien-
tiﬁc), following sample lyophilization, homogenization in
0.5 M HCl, and vigorous mixing for 16 h at 48C. Alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activity was calculated (n ¼ 3 per group)
using Sigmafast p-nitrophenyl phosphate Tablets (Sigma)
following sample homogenization in 0.75 M 2-amino-2-
methyl propanol solution and measurement of absorptivity
kinetics of reaction products at 405 nm with a Perkin Elmer
Victor 3 plate reader (Perkin Elmer).
Biphasic mechanical testing was performed to determine
aggregate modulus (HA), hydraulic permeability (k), Young’s
modulus (E), and complex shear modulus (G*) as previously
described.24 Test specimens were obtained (n ¼ 3–6 per
group) by punching 3-mm-diameter cores from the centers of

harvested constructs. Conﬁned-compression creep tests and
unconﬁned stress–relaxation tests were performed using a
Bose-Enduratec ELF 3200 materials testing system. For con-
ﬁned compression test, specimens from the chondrogenic
group were subjected to a 5-gf tare load and a 15-gf step
compressive load, to ensure that strains remained in the in-
ﬁnitesimal range; specimens from the osteogenic group
equilibrated to a 10-gf tare load before application of a 30-gf
step compressive load. For unconﬁned stress–relaxation tests,
specimens were equilibrated to a 5-gf tare load, and then
strain steps of 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16 were sequentially ap-
plied, with each step lasting for 900 s. Dynamic frequency
sweep tests were performed using an ARES Rheometrics
System. Specimens were placed between two porous rigid
platens in a bath of phosphate-buffered saline. After equili-
bration to a compressive offset strain of 10%, a sinusoidal
shear strain was applied. Parameters for the dynamic test
include a shear strain amplitude 5% and an angular frequency
(o) that increased logarithmically from 1 to 50 rad/s. Values
were reported for o ¼ 10 rad/s.
Total RNA was isolated (n ¼ 2 samples per group) by ho-
mogenization in Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by extraction in
chloroform and centrifugation (20,800 g, 48C, 20 min). The
RNA was precipitated by adding 2-propanol followed by
centrifugation (20,800 g, 48C, 20 min). The pellet was washed
in 70% ethanol, centrifuged (10,600 g, 48C, 10 min), dried,
dissolved in water, and frozen at 808C. cDNA was synthe-
sized by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using
the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen)
with a PCR Sprint Thermal cycler (Thermo Electron Co.).
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was
performed using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) detecting reagent on a Sequence Step One Plus real-
time PCR (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression level was
ﬁrst normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase, and then normalized to the mRNA level measured for
the corresponding 1-day sample from the chondrogenic
group. Sequences of PCR primers are provided in Table 1.
Statistical analysis
A full-factorial two-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s
HSD post hoc test was performed (JMP v8.0; SAS Institute,
Inc.) to assess the effects of culture time and medium type
on biochemical and biomechanical parameters. Values of
p < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Results
Construct wet and dry weight increased signiﬁcantly with
culture time in both groups (Table 2). In the chondrogenic
group, the upward-facing surfaces were smooth and hyaline
like (Fig. 1A, B), whereas tissue formation was less pro-
nounced at the lower surfaces facing the bottom of the cul-
ture well. In the osteogenic group the surfaces were rough
with the woven contours of the underlying PCL scaffold
clearly visible (Fig. 1C, D). In the chondrogenic group,
abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) was present through-
out the full thickness of the constructs at 21 days (Fig. 1E),
and new tissue extended beyond the conﬁnes of the PCL
scaffold at 45 days (Fig. 1F). In contrast, in the osteogenic
group ECM was less prevalent and was conﬁned within the
PCL scaffold (Fig. 1G, H). DNA content was signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by culture time but not medium additives (Table
2). Between culture days 1 and 21, DNA increased by two- to
threefold, whereas between days 21 and 45 DNA decreased
slightly in both groups. In the chondrogenic group at 21
days, cell morphology was predominately polygonal, with
some cells exhibiting rounded, chondrocytic morphology
(Fig. 1I) and a few ﬁbroblastic cells. After 45 days, various
characteristics of mature chondrocytes were evident, in-
cluding condensed cells in lacunae (Fig. 1J) and nesting cells
(Fig. 1K). In the osteogenic group, cell morphologies at 21
and 45 days ranged from ﬁbroblastic to elongated, with no
chondrocytic cells present (Fig. 1L, M). Apoptosis was not
prevalent, but pycnotic cells were occasionally present in the
central and lower regions of constructs cultured in both types
of media (data not shown).
The amount of OHP, an indicator of total collagen, de-
pended on culture time and medium additives, with signif-
icant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001) (Table 2). In the
chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, 45-day constructs had
OHP contents of 75 and 27 mg/construct, respectively (Table
2). In the chondrogenic group, the ECM was predominately
hyaline like (Figs. 2A and 3A), whereas in the osteogenic
group, the ECM was ﬁbrocartilaginous (Figs. 2B and 3B).
Collagen type I was present at low levels in both groups at
both time points (data not shown). Collagen type II, the
major collagen in cartilage, was prevalent in the chondro-
genic group (Figs. 2C and 3C), but was not detected in the
osteogenic group (Figs. 2D and 3D). The amount of GAG, an
indicator of cartilage, depended on culture time and medium
additives, with signiﬁcant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001).

REGIONAL MINERALIZATION OF ENGINEERED CARTILAGE
3711

In the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, 45-day con-
structs had GAG contents of 1370 mg/construct and 29 mg/
construct, respectively (Table 2). Consistently, GAG stain-
ing by safranin-O was intense in the chondrogenic group
(Fig. 3E), but was not detected in the osteogenic group
(Fig. 3F).
In the chondrogenic group at 45 days, columns of rounded
cells in lacunae were oriented perpendicular to the surface in
the deep and middle portions of the construct, and elongated
cells were aligned in parallel to the surface in the superﬁcial
portions (Fig. 3C). This cellular organization is analogous to
certain architectural features present in normal articular
cartilage.
Mineralization was demonstrated by quantitative cal-
cium assay, histological staining, and microCT imaging. The
amount of calcium depended on culture time and medium
additives, with signiﬁcant interactive effects present (all p <
0.0001) (Table 2). In the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups,
45-day constructs had calcium contents of 247 mg/construct
and 441 mg/construct, respectively. In the chondrogenic
group, ALP activity depended on culture time and medium
additives, with signiﬁcant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001)
(Table 2). Between days 1 and 21, ALP activity increased 100-
fold and 10-fold in the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups,
respectively. In the chondrogenic group, mineralized regions
were not found at 21 days (Fig. 2G), but were present in some
but not all regions at 45 days (Fig. 3G, H), by alizarin red
staining. In the osteogenic group, mineralized regions were
present at 21 days (Fig. 2H) and in some but not all regions at
45 days (Fig. 3 I, J). Small nodules were observed by phase-
contrast microscopy in the chondrogenic group at 45 days and
in the osteogenic group at 21 and 45 days (data not shown).
The 45-day constructs from the chondrogenic group ex-
hibited mineralization at the interface between newly formed
tissue and the underlying PCL scaffold, and in a ring-like
pattern, based on histological cross sections (Fig. 4A), and
top-down microCT views (Fig. 4B), respectively. Miner-
alization was colocalized in areas where hyaline-like carti-
lage matrix was also deposited, based on serial histological
sections. Speciﬁcally, in the same region where alizarin red
stain revealed mineralization (Fig. 4A inset and C), a hyaline
cartilage matrix was evident by safranin-O (Fig. 4D) and

Masson’s trichrome (Fig. 4E). In 21- and 45-day constructs in
the osteogenic group, sparse mineralization was observed
throughout the PCL scaffold, based on histological cross
sections and microCT images (data not shown).
In the chondrogenic group, mRNA expression patterns
were characteristic of chondrogenesis followed by chon-
drocyte hypertrophy, as demonstrated by RT-PCR (Table 3).
Speciﬁcally, Sox-9, collagen type II, and aggrecan were se-
quentially expressed. Moreover, early and late bone markers
were also detected. Speciﬁcally, core binding factor alpha 1

osteogenic group genes characteristic of bone formation were
expressed, but at levels similar to or lower than those in the
chondrogenic group at days 1 and 21, and lower than those
in chondrogenic group at day 45 (Table 3). In the osteogenic
group, expression of the cartilage markers Sox-9, collagen
type II, and aggrecan was at least one order of magnitude
lower than in the chondrogenic group.
Aggregate modulus (HA) depended signiﬁcantly on me-
dium additives ( p < 0.0001) (Table 2). Hydraulic permeabil-
ity (k) depended on culture time and medium additives with
a signiﬁcant interactive effect (all p < 0.05). At 21 days, con-
structs in the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups exhibited
similar values of HA and k, but between days 21 and 45, HA
decreased and k increased in the chondrogenic group,
whereas neither parameter changed signiﬁcantly in the os-
teogenic group (Table 2). Young’s modulus depended sig-
niﬁcantly
on
medium
additives
( p < 0.0001),
and
was
consistently lower in the chondrogenic group than in the
osteogenic group (Table 2). Complex shear modulus was
independent of medium additives and time (Table 2). Phase
angle ranged from 208 to 308 under all conditions tested,
suggesting viscoelastic solid-like behavior.
Discussion
In this study, signiﬁcant effects of culture duration and
medium additives on hMSC-based tissue-engineered carti-
lage and bone were demonstrated by structural, composi-
tional, mechanical, and genetic methods. In chondrogenic
medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hyper-
trophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed
ECM at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. The
study opens up new possibilities for osteochondral tissue
engineering, which is a clinically relevant strategy for carti-
lage regeneration of the knee. For example, by providing
different concentrations of oxygen and/or growth factors on
the upper and lower surfaces of hMSC-based constructs, it
may be feasible to maintain cartilaginous tissue on one side,
while inducing bone formation on the opposite side.
The ﬁnding that 21-day cultures in chondrogenic medium
exhibited
chondrogenic
differentiation
and
mechanical
functionality (Fig. 2; Tables 1 and 2) is consistent with our
previous study.17 The ﬁnding of sequential regulation of the
transcription factors Sox-9, collagen type II, and aggrecan
(Table 3) provided evidence of active cellular processes. We
attribute the development of cartilaginous tissue to soluble
medium additives (TGF-b, ITS, and dexamethasone) in the
context of a 3D cellular substrate with appropriate mechan-
ical stiffness. Aggregate modulus (average  standard devi-
ation) of 21-day constructs in the present study (HA,
0.24  0.044 MPa; Table 2) was somewhat lower than that of
our previous study of 21-day constructs based on hMSCs
embedded in Matrigel and 3D woven PCL and cultured
statically (HA, 0.37  0.079 MPa).17 Possible explanations for
this difference, which may or may not be statistically sig-
niﬁcant, include use in the present study of collagen gel for
cell seeding25 and operator-to-operator differences in cell
seeding technique. Research to further optimize cell seeding
technique is in progress.
In the present study, aggregate moduli of 3D woven scaf-
folds seeded with hMSC and cultured for 21 days in chon-
drogenic and osteogenic media (HA *0.24 and *0.27 MPa,
respectively, Table 2) were lower than those previously re-
ported for the same scaffolds cultured without cells for 14–28
days (HA *0.45 MPa), which was the longest duration pre-
viously tested.24 In the present study, an increase in culture
duration to 45 days was associated with a decrease in HA, an
increase in k, and the formation of a thick tissue-like layer
comprised of cells and ECM that extended beyond the con-
ﬁnes of the scaffold in the chondrogenic group (Table 2 and
Fig. 1E, F), while mechanical properties were maintained and
thick surface layers did not form in the osteogenic group
(Table 2; Fig. 1G, H). Together, these data suggest that con-
struct mechanical properties were initially dominated by the
3D woven scaffold, which had a relatively high compressive
modulus, but were then inﬂuenced by ECM that secreted by
the cultured cells, which had a lower compressive modulus.
This effect depended on culture duration and was particularly
evident in the chondrogenic medium group, where under
static culture conditions a thick layer of ECM was deposited at
the construct surfaces led to reductions in HA and E and an
increase in k (Table 2). We attribute the inhomogeneous

REGIONAL MINERALIZATION OF ENGINEERED CARTILAGE

overgrowth that occurred to the static culture conditions and
potentially to the inﬂuence of type I collagen gel on chon-
drogenesis, based on previous studies.17,25–30 Further studies
are warranted to determine relative contributions to construct
mechanical properties of the scaffold versus ECM, and to
assess longer term mechanical properties of the 3D woven
PCL without and with cultured cells.
An important ﬁnding of the present study was that
of regional mineralization of the cartilaginous matrix after
45 days in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4 and Tables 1 and 2). While
chondrogenic stimulation of constructs increased expression
of cartilage markers, our ﬁndings also suggest that long-term
culture of these constructs resulted in a hypertrophic chon-
drocyte phenotype. Thus, the mineralization pattern ob-
served in these constructs may be analogous in some respects
to processes that occur during endochondral ossiﬁcation31,32
Upregulation of the bone transcription factor Cbfa1/Runx2
in association with other bone markers ALP, bone sialopro-
tein, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and osteocalcin (Table 3)
provided evidence of active cellular processes, although
passive calcium deposition may also have occurred as in a
recent study.33 Consistently, increased expression by hMSC
of these genes as well as collagen type X, the hallmark of
hypertrophic chondrocytes, was previously reported after
chondrogenic induction.34–37 Moreover, bone marker ex-
pression was ampliﬁed by prolonged culture in some stud-
ies.38,39 Our use of type I collagen as the cell seeding gel may
have played a role in committing some hMSC toward os-
teogenesis.40,41
On the basis of previous studies associating ECM stiffness
with MSC lineage commitment,16 it is possible that miner-
alization was triggered by local mechanical cues imparted by
the type I collagen gel and/or the PCL scaffold. For example,
a comparative study of gel-like carrier materials showed that
Matrigel suppressed calciﬁcation in ectopic implants of MSC-
seeded constructs.25 Alternatively, the slowly degrading
scaffold (e.g., PCL) may have played a role, since minerali-
zation was not observed in vitro in constructs based on
hMSCs and a rapidly degrading PGA scaffold, even after
extended (i.e., 12 week) culture.13 Hence, different temporal
patterns of mechanical cues provided by the two scaffold
platforms (PCL or PGA) could explain the observed miner-
alization (or lack thereof). It is also possible that minerali-
zation was triggered by local physiologic cues, such as
gradients in oxygen tension or pH, as cartilage development
is associated with anaerobic conditions, while bone devel-
opment is associated with more aerobic conditions.42,43
However, measurement of these physicochemical parame-
ters was beyond the scope of the present study; hence, future
studies may address their roles in inducing site-speciﬁc tis-
sue differentiation. Likewise, it would be interesting to know
whether the differences observed between chondrogenic and
osteogenic media would also be seen with different scaffold
materials and structures.
One limitation of the current work is that the data set was
derived from a single cell donor, whereas ﬁve or six different
donors would be required to address the donor-to-donor
variability in hMSCs that can result in unforeseen irregu-
larities not associated with the current experimental param-
eters. In our ongoing work, hMSCs from additional donors
are being combined with 3D woven PCL to address the
important issue of donor-to-donor variability.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that culture
duration and medium additives signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced
chondrogenesis and/or osteogenesis by hMSCs in the con-
text of a scaffold with appropriate mechanical properties.
The study opens up new possibilities for osteochondral tis-
sue engineering. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are ex-
pected to lead to improved regenerative platforms (i.e.,
scaffolds and in vitro culture environments), and to more
reliable therapeutic products.
