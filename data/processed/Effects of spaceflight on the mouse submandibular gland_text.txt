Introduction: Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from
community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and
space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the
earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves,
including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in
multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is
regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the
oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous
system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands,
precisely
controls
serous
and
mucous
saliva.
Psychological
stress,
radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary
secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress
marker in behavioral medicine and space ﬂight crews; however, the
detailed
mechanisms
underlying
amylase
regulation
in
the
space
environment are still unknown.
Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g) changes
mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artiﬁcial gravity
research system during space ﬂight in the International Space Station, we
studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth
gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to
Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days
after landing.
Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary
amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which regulate
water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine
system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small G
proteins,
including
Rap1
and
Rab
families,
were
upregulated
under
lunar gravity.

secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8. Our study highlights
Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the

1 Introduction
The transition from 1 g to the space environment changes not
only gravity but also various other conditions such as the circadian
rhythm (Otsuka et al., 2018) and exposure to cosmic rays (Zeitlin
et al., 2013). It is important to elucidate the medical risks that
humans face when living in a space environment, such as the
oxidative stress caused by cosmic radiation (Overbey et al., 2019)
and mechanical stress caused by microgravity (Dadwal et al., 2019).
Artiﬁcial
imitation
of
these
environments
may
provide
an
understanding of gravitational physiology and determine how to
avoid space stress.
A previous study showed that the gravitational threshold in the
space
environment
provides
a
platform
for
exploring
the
mechanisms
controlling
the
skeletal
muscle
response
to
alterations in gravity (Hayashi et al., 2023). Elucidation of the
functional changes and molecular mechanisms involved may lead
to the development of strategies to maintain human health during
future long-term space travel. The musculoskeletal system and
muscle movement controlled by somatic nerves have been
studied
previously
in
space
and
artiﬁcial
gravitational
environments (Juhl et al., 2021; Hayashi et al., 2023). Although
studies on the heart rate and activity rhythms controlled by the
autonomic nervous system in space are addressed (Blaber et al.,
2004; Liu et al., 2015), research on the salivary glands, which are
representative of local ﬂuid balance regulation by the system, are
limited. Saliva maintains the moist environment of oral tissues and is
essential not only for feeding, mastication, and swallowing food but
also for oral functions such as digestion, and articulation. In
addition, saliva has antibacterial properties that help control the
growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth, contributing to oral
hygiene and prevention of dental issues such as cavities and gum
disease. Saliva helps maintain pH balance in the mouth and
neutralizes the acids produced by bacteria, thereby reducing the
risk of tooth decay and erosion. It plays a role in taste perception by
dissolving food particles and allowing them to interact with the taste
buds in the tongue. Therefore, saliva is a multifunctional ﬂuid that
contributes signiﬁcantly to oral and digestive health. Insufﬁcient
saliva production, known as dry mouth or xerostomia, can lead to
various oral health problems and difﬁculties chewing, swallowing,
and speaking. However, little is known about the regulatory
mechanisms of salivary secretion during spaceﬂights.
In this study, we collected submandibular glands from mice
exposed to artiﬁcial lunar gravity.
Among the major salivary glands, the large amount of saliva
secretion comes from the submandibular gland. Therefore, we
thought
that
changes
in
salivary
gland
mRNA
due
to
environmental changes might be more clearly observed in the
submandibular gland compared to other salivary glands. In
addition, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and we
considered that it would be a good model to observe the control
mechanism and balance of protein secretion and water secretion by
the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, i.e., under autonomic
regulation.
Artiﬁcial lunar gravity was developed using multiple artiﬁcial
gravity research systems (MARS) that use a centrifuge to create
artiﬁcial gravity, enabling comparative studies between the effects of
gravity and microgravity in space (Shimbo et al., 2016; Shiba et al.,
2017; Okada et al., 2021). This system has contributed to analysis of
sulfur metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in the liver
(Kurosawa et al., 2021), metabolic effects in adipose tissues
(Suzuki et al., 2020; Uruno et al., 2021), blood parameters
changes (Shimizu et al., 2023), bone mineralization, blood
pressure, and lipid metabolism in mouse kidneys (Suzuki et al.,
2022) during space travel. This study investigated the basic
foundations for oral clinical medicine under lunar gravity. We
sought to understand whether lunar gravity (1/6 g) inﬂuence the
mRNA expression in salivary glands during space ﬂight. Using the
developed MARS, two independent missions (MHU-4 and MHU-5)
were conducted in the space. Using the MARS system, we analyzed
the mRNA expression of the whole submandibular gland tissue of
mice raised under lunar (1/6 g) and Earth gravity (1 g).
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Animals
C57BL/6 J male mice (Stock #000664) obtained from Jackson
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, United States) and Charles River
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, United States) were used for the
MHU-4 and -5 missions. All experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) (Protocol Number: No.
018-011D for MHU-4 and No. 018-036D for MHU-5), Explora
Biolabs (Study Number: No. EB19-003 for MHU-4 and No. SP19-
003 for MHU-5), and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) (Protocol Number: No. FLT-18-118 for
MHU-4 and No. JAXA MHU-5/FLT-19-121 for MHU-5). All
experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines
and applicable laws of Japan and the United States.
2.2 MHU missions
The ground control group (GC) comprised of six age-matched (9-
week-old) male C57BL/6 J mice per mission, maintained on Earth
under the same conditions as those aboard the International Space

Station (ISS). A detailed description of the space ﬂight experiments
has been previously reported (Hayashi et al., 2023).
In the MHU-4 mission, six 9-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice in a
transportation cage unit were launched aboard SpX-17 on 7 May
2019, from the NASA Kennedy Space Center and were then
transported to the ISS. The MHU-4 partial gravity (PG) group
was maintained in an artiﬁcial gravity environment of 1/6 g on the
bottom ﬂoor of the habitat cage unit by centrifugation at 31 rpm in
MARS using a short-radius (15 cm) centrifuge (MARS-S).
In the MHU-5 mission, six 9-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice in a
transportation cage unit were launched aboard SpX-20 on 10 March
2020, from the NASA Kennedy Space Center and were then
transported to the ISS. The MHU-5_PG group was maintained
in an artiﬁcial gravity environment of 1/6 g on the bottom ﬂoor of
the habitat cage unit by centrifugation at 21 rpm in MARS using a
long-radius (35 cm) centrifuge (MARS-L).
The lighting in the mouse habitat cage considered the circadian
rhythm and used a 12-h cycle according to the ISS and GMT
(standard) time, with a light period of 7:00 to 19:00 and a dark
period from 19:00 to 7:00 the next day.
Cage unit was equipped with a water dispenser and a feeder that
can automatically supply water and food. The crew only needed to
periodically reﬁll the water and replenish the food, reducing the
workload of the crew. The water dispenser was based on a balloon
for injecting medicines, and drinking water was supplied by
pressurizing the water using the elasticity of the balloon. The
amount of water in the balloon was able to be detected by a
sensor when it was full and when a certain amount of water had
been consumed from full. For feeding, a spring was used to push out
integrally molded food to the feeding surface. Food needed to be
replenished once a week, but the food in this device was in cartridge
form, making it easy for the crew to replace the cartridges.
All the mice from each mission were sacriﬁced on the second day
after returning to the Earth.
2.3 Sample collection and preparation
Submandibular glands were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 1–2 d at 4 °C before replacing the
paraformaldehyde with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The MHU-
4 mission samples were processed in the United States in June 2019, and
the MHU-5 mission samples were processed in the United States in
April 2020. After approximately 40 d, the samples were treated with
different concentrations of methanol, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, for
30 min each and then maintained in 100% methanol. The MHU-4
mission samples were processed in Japan in July 2019, and the MHU-5
mission samples were processed in Japan in May 2020.
Samples from the ground control experiments were treated
using the same method as those from the space experiments. The
MHU-4 mission, samples were processed in December 2019; and the
MHU-5 samples were processed in October 2020.
2.4 Total RNA isolation
Total RNA from whole submandibular gland in each group (the
MHU-4 GC, the MHU-4 PG, the MHU-5 GC, the MHU-5 PG); n =
1 for each was isolated from the cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA samples were quantiﬁed using a Nanodrop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA,
United
States),
and
their
quality
was
conﬁrmed
using
a
2,200
TapeStation
(Agilent
Technologies,
Santa
Clara,
CA,
United States).
2.5 Gene expression microarrays
The total RNA from whole submandibular gland in each group
was ampliﬁed using GeneChip® WT Pico Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) and hybridized to the Clariom™S Assay, mouse
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All hybridized microarrays were scanned using an
Affymetrix
scanner
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientiﬁc).
Relative
hybridization intensities and background hybridization values
were calculated using Affymetrix Expression Console™. Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted according to methods
previously described (Mootha et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2005).
2.6 Data analysis and ﬁlter criteria
The raw signal intensities of all samples were normalized by a
quantile
algorithm
using
Affymetrix®
Power
Tools
version
1.15.0 software. To identify up- or downregulated genes, we
calculated Z-scores [Z] and ratios (non-log scaled fold-change)
from
the
normalized
signal
intensities
of
each
probe
for
comparison between the control and experimental samples. The
criteria for upregulated genes was Z-score ≥2.0 and ratio ≥1.5-fold
and for downregulated genes was Z-score ≤−2.0 and ratio ≤0.66.
Since there were no replicate samples in this analysis, it was
impossible
to
evaluate
the
data
using
p-values.
We
used
intensity-based Z-scores and fold changes to extract differentially
expressed mRNAs. This is expected to reduce noise compared to
extracting variable mRNAs based only on fold change values
(Quackenbush, 2002).
2.7 Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
We conducted immunoﬂuorescence staining by using the
whole submandibular gland in each group (the MHU-4 GC, the
MHU-4 PG, the MHU-5 GC, the MHU-5 PG); n = 1 for each. The
ﬁxed submandibular glands were embedded in parafﬁn, and 2 μm
sections were prepared using a microtome (Leica Biosystems,
Wetzlar,
Germany).
The
sections
were
deparafﬁnized
by
immersing in xylene (Wako) for 10 min three times. The
sections were then rehydrated using sequential immersion in
100%,
95%,
and
70%
ethanol
for
10 min.
After
ethanol
treatment, the sections were washed three times with PBS. For
immunoﬂuorescence analysis, the samples were permeabilized
with
Triton
X-100
(Sigma
Aldrich,
St.
Louis,
MO,
United States) for 5 min before incubating with blocking buffer
(Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at room temperature for 15 min.
To evaluate the protein expression patterns, the samples were then

(13412-1-AP; 1:200; Proteintech), and rabbit polyclonal anti-
Vamp8 (15546-1-AP; 1:200; Proteintech).
After washing with PBS, the following secondary antibodies
were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature: Alexa Fluor®
568 donkey anti-mouse (#A10037; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), Alexa
Fluor® 488 donkey anti-rabbit (#A21206, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
After washing with PBS, the stained samples were mounted in a
mounting reagent with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (ab104139;
Abcam) and analyzed using a ﬂuorescence microscope (X710, X800;
Keyence, Osaka, Japan).
3 Results
Microarray analysis to examine the changes in mRNA expression
of the 22,206 genes found no correlation (correlation coefﬁcient:
0.077052) between the submandibular gland samples obtained from
the MHU-4 and -5 missions, even though both missions were
conducted under the same lunar surface gravity environments
(Figure 1). This may be due to differences in the centrifugal gradient
caused by the radius of each MARS and circadian ﬂuctuation between
the time points for collecting samples in two missions.
We then investigated the cells comprising the submandibular
glands and surrounding cell populations, based on speciﬁc marker,
to identify which cell components showed speciﬁc mRNA
expression changes in the lunar gravity environment in MHU-4
and -5. The heat map in Figure 2A shows signal intensity ratio of
mRNA expression in samples at 1 g and 1/6 g environment in both
MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Red indicates upregulated genes at 1/
6 g and green indicates downregulated genes at 1/6 g compared to
the 1 g group. Microarray analysis of whole submandibular glands
samples from both MHU-4 and -5 revealed that the overall variation
in mRNA expression was more pronounced in the MHU-4 mission
than in the MHU-5 mission. Expression of mRNA relating the
acinar cells, characterized by Amy1, Bhlha15, Sox10 were more
pronounced than those from other cell populations (Figure 2A).
The expression of mRNA related to proliferation and apoptosis did
not signiﬁcantly increase at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group

MHU-4 and -5 missions.

increases were more observed in MHU-4 compared with those in
MHU-5. (B) Genes relating to cell proliferation and apoptosis showed
no upregulation. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g

(Figure 2B). Therefore, we focused on mature acinar cells that have
physiological functions such as protein and water secretion.
Amy1 encodes salivary amylase secreted by acinar cells, which is
an organic component involved in serous saliva. Amy1 showed
signiﬁcant upregulation in the samples in the 1/6 g environment
during both MHU missions (Figure 3A). In contrast, Aqp5, which is
involved in water secretion in acinar cells, was highly expressed (data
not shown), but no signiﬁcant changes in the mRNA expression
were observed between lunar gravity and ground controls in either
mission (Figure 3A). Immunoﬂuorescence staining showed that the
amylase protein was expressed at a higher level in lunar gravity than
in the ground control, which was consistent with the microarray
results. Aqp5 protein expression was also consistent with the
microarray data (Figure 3B).
We further examined signal intensity ratio of mRNA for
membrane proteins with cytosolic coiled-coil domains, termed
SNAREs, which are found in vesicles (v-SNAREs) and organelles
(t-SNAREs) in whole submandibular glands. Vesicle-associated
membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) is a v-SNARE gene involved in
protein vesicle secretion mainly by acinar cells and was highly
expressed under lunar gravity in both MHU missions; however,
there was no increase in t-SNARE (Figure 4A). Based on these

from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed that salivary protein gene Amy1 was upregulated in 1/6 g lunar gravity in both MHU-4

downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunoﬂuorescence staining conﬁrmed the increased expression of amylase in 1/6 g
lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and -5 but no increase of Aqp5 even though the salivary cells were highly immunopositive for Aqp5. Scale bar: 50 μm.

results, it was assumed that amylase secretion was promoted
through Vamp8 in the 1/6 g lunar gravity environment compared
to 1 g. In samples from the both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions,
immunostaining
revealed
that
amylase
and
Vamp8
protein
expression was co-localized within acinar cells. We also observed
strong expression of Vamp8 protein at apical side of cell membrane
FIGURE 4

1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed changes in expression of the v-SNARE gene, Vamp8. Other v-SNARE genes such as Vamp2, 5, and 7 were
upregulated at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g in MHU-4. Upregulation of the t-SNARE gene in lunar gravity was not observed. Red in heat map indicates
upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunoﬂuorescence
staining conﬁrmed the co-localization of amylase and Vamp8 in acinar cells. Co-localized expression of amylase and Vamp8 was higher in lunar gravity
compared with ground control for MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Insets (white dotted rectangles) were enlarged from the yellow dotted rectangles.

vesicle-membrane docking to secrete salivary proteins (Figure 4B).
Microarray
analysis
showed an increase
in the
mRNA
expression of Rap1b, a subfamily of the Ras family in the 1/6 g
lunar gravity of both MHU-4 and -5 groups (Figure 5A). The
immunoﬂuorescence staining results showed the upregulation of
Rap1 protein, which were similar with the microarray data
(Figure 5B). Increases of mRNA expression in samples from PG
in both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions were also observed for Rab1,
Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27, which are members of the Rab family
(Figure 6A). Immunoﬂuorescence staining showed upregulation of
Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 protein which were similar with the
microarray data (Figure 6B). Upregulation of some mRNAs from
the Rho (Figure 7A), Sar/Arf (Figure 7B), and Ran (Figure 7C)
families was observed at 1/6 g samples but did not show common
expression patterns between MHU-4 and -5 missions, except for
GEF/GAP (Figures 7A–C).
We explored upstream signaling pathways, including Gs, Gi, or
Gq
protein-coupled
receptors
and
their
respective
second
messengers and enzyme-related factors, as well as mRNA
related to adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous
system and acetylcholine receptors in the parasympathetic
nervous system. We observed no signiﬁcant differences in
mRNA expression of them between the samples of GC and PG

to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors in the submandibular

synthesis was also upregulated at 1/6 g lunar gravity compared to
that under 1 g in the MHU-4 and -5 missions (Figure 9B).
We then investigated whether mechanosensitive ion channels in
the submandibular glands sense gravity-induced ﬂuid changes. The
heat map shows ratio in changes in the mRNA expression of cation
channels, especially transient receptor potential (TRP), Piezo, and
acid-sensing ion (ASIC) channels. We revealed mechanosensitive
ion channel genes, such as Trpv2, Trpv4, Piezo1, Piezo2, and Asic3
were downregulated in the 1/6 g group compared with the 1 g group
in MHU-4 and -5 (Figure 10).
4 Discussion
In the 1/6 g lunar gravitational environment, Amy1 was
upregulated in the submandibular glands, as were Vamp8 and
the small G protein Rap1 (Ras family)/Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27
(Rab family) which are involved in vesicle secretion. Amylase has
been identiﬁed as a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space
ﬂight crews (Ali and Nater, 2020; Ghasemi et al., 2021). Vamp8 acts
as a v-SNARE that regulates the secretion of the entire exocrine
system (Wang et al., 2007). Salivary proteins are synthesized in
acinar cells. Based on the genetic information in acinar cells, salivary
proteins are synthesized in ribosomes, pass through the rough
endoplasmic reticulum, become vesicles, and are transported to
the
Golgi
apparatus.
Intravesicular
proteins
that
undergo
modiﬁcations, such as glycosylation, in the Golgi apparatus are
concentrated and stored in secretory granules. Small G proteins such
as Ras and Rab families function salivary secretion, as guanosine
triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins with a molecular weight of
20–30 kDa.
This
hydrolysis
results
in
inactive
guanosine
diphosphate (GDP). Small G proteins act as molecular switches
that bind speciﬁc target molecules and transmit intracellular signals.
GDP/GTP exchange proteins (GEF) are regulated by GTPase-
activating proteins (GAPs). The combined GTP and GDP states

function as molecular switches corresponding to the on/off states.
Activity regulation is temporally and spatially controlled and
functions as a biotimer. Small G proteins are classiﬁed into ﬁve
families, and regulate various cellular functions. Rap/Rab signaling
plays an important role in saliva and amylase secretion (D’Silva
et al., 1998; Sabbatini et al., 2008; Gomi et al., 2017). Our study
showed no increase in the expression of mRNA related to receptors
for noradrenaline secreted from sympathetic nerves involved in
protein secretion, where is the upstream of salivary secretion system,
while
upregulations
of
Rap/Rab
signaling
for
transporting
intracellular vesicles and v-SNARE (Vamp8) to secrete amylase
via exocytosis at apical side of acinar cells were observed in the
1/6 g environment.
In addition, salivary secretion requires high levels of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) not only for salivary secretion by maintaining
intracellular K+ concentration in acinar cells, but also for
modiﬁcation of saliva by reabsorption and secretion in ductal
cells of submandibular gland. Our GSEA data show that a set of
mRNAs
involved
in
oxidative
phosphorylation
was
highly
upregulated under 1/6 g lunar gravity in MHU-4 and -5. Plus,
mRNAs in association of ionic transport coupled with ATP
synthesis or hydrolysis were also upregulated at 1/6 g lunar

gravity compared to that under 1 g in the MHU-4 and -5 missions.
We also hypothesized that changes in gravity may induce changes in
body
ﬂuids,
resulting
in
excessive
ﬂuid
inﬂow
into
the
submandibular
gland.
Our
data
shows
downregulation
of
mechanosensitive ion channels such as TRP, Piezo, and ASIC
channels, however. Fluid balance ﬂuctuates when gravity changes,
shifting ﬂuid to the upper body and creating a situation where the
astronauts have edema around the salivary glands, which causes
mechanical stress. It is possible that the mRNA levels of these
mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular gland
decrease because of a function that restores them to their
normal state.
In conclusion, our results indicate that changes in the
gravitational
environment
induce
qualitative
changes
in
salivary secretion function and that multiple genes may be
involved in maintaining salivary secretion homeostasis in the
space environment. Overall, our data suggested that lunar
gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via vesicular
transport and exocytosis mediated by Rap/Rab signaling and
Vamp8 at apical side of acinar cells (Figure 11). However, we
have not shown the functional assay as amylase secretion in this
study. To clarify the correlation mechanisms between these
mRNAs and amylase secretion, it will need to be veriﬁed
whether any effect on amylase secretion is caused by both
gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in acinar
cells. Further research on salivary secretion signal and gene
regulation may contribute to the future monitoring of the
physical and mental health of humans living in space as well
as the improvement of oral medicine.
