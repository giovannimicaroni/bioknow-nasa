Annexins are multifunctional proteins that have 
been found in all plants and vertebrate species. Their 
tertiary structure with calcium-binding domains is 
evolutionarily conserved in all species (Morgan et al., 
2004, 2006; Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2011; Clark 
et al., 2012). In plants, annexins have been localized 
in many parts of the cell, including the plasma mem-
brane, the Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, vacuolar 
membranes, and the nucleus. Certain annexins are also 
found in the extracellular matrix as secreted proteins.
On the molecular level, certain plant annexins serve 
as components of calcium channels or regulate calcium 
channel activity to help initiate and amplify calcium 
signals in plants (Laohavisit et al., 2010; Laohavisit 
and Davies, 2011; Davies, 2014). On the cellular level, 
one of the earliest functions discovered for annexins 
in plant cells was meditation of vesicle trafficking and 
secretion (Konopka-Postupolska and Clark, 2017). On 
the whole-plant level, key discoveries of annexin func-
tion have been carried out using mutants of the model 
plant, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), where there 
are eight different annexins that show differential ex-
pression patterns (Cantero et al., 2006). Several of these 
mutant studies show that certain Arabidopsis annexins 
function to provide stress tolerance in response to a 
variety of stress conditions (Konopka-Postupolska et al., 
2009; Dalal et al., 2014; Richards et al., 2014; Wang et al., 
2015; Liao et al., 2017). For example, overexpression 
of ANN1 in Arabidopsis results in increased antioxi-
dant activity and confers drought tolerance (Konopka- 
Postupolska et al., 2009).
Plant annexins are expressed in all stages of plant 
growth and development. Recently, Thieme et al. (2015) 
found that some Arabidopsis annexin transcripts can 
be transported across the whole plant by phloem sap. 
Annexin proteins have also been identified in the 
phloem sap of several different plant species (Kehr, 
2006), and in Arabidopsis, ANN1 was found in phloem 
exudate of rosette leaves (Guelette et al., 2012). Im-
munolocalization of a pea annexin protein in young 
developing sieve elements led to the suggestion that 
annexins may play a role in phloem cell development 
(Clark et al., 1992). In situ transcript localization studies 
found that ANN1 is expressed in phloem and phloem 
parenchyma in Arabidopsis seedlings (Clark et al.,

Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell sig-
naling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis 
(Arabidopsis thaliana) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in 
seedlings. Here, we showed that ann-mutant seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and 
altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without 
sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in ann-mutant coty-
ledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of ann-mutant seedlings. Unexpect-
edly, the overall sugar content of ann-mutant primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown 
without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of car-
boxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in ann-mutant root tips compared to that in wild 
type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of ann-mutant seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of 
which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important 
role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This 
study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.

2001). However, the physiological importance of an-
nexins in phloem remains undefined.
Phloem transport links sources to sinks and is a key 
passageway for communication between leaves and 
roots. Sugars generated from photosynthetic leaves 
(source organs) and transported through the phloem to 
roots (sink organs) serve both as metabolic substrates to 
fuel plant growth and development and as signals that 
integrate plant responses to environmental stimuli, 
hormones, and changes in nutrition status (Martin 
et al., 2002; Moore et al., 2003; Smeekens et al., 2010; 
Lastdrager et al., 2014; Ljung et al., 2015; Dobrenel et al., 
2016; Dodds and Lagudah, 2016; Kühn, 2016; Li and 
Sheen, 2016; Baena-González and Hanson, 2017). Plants 
have developed complex sugar-sensing systems to 
monitor and respond to continuous fluctuations in sugar 
status caused by the circadian clock and frequent envi-
ronmental changes (Stitt and Zeeman, 2012).
Multiple recent studies have revealed significant 
roles of sugar in plant growth (Lastdrager et al., 2014) 
and development (Wingler, 2018). For example, sugar 
availability to axillary buds is a key determinant for 
shoot branching. Removal of pea shoot tips induces a 
sufficient flow of sugar into axillary buds to repress the 
expression of the branching inhibitor gene Branched1, 
which highlights the importance of sugars in mediat-
ing apical dominance (Mason et al., 2014). Sugars in 
photosynthetic leaves function as mobile signals to 
repress the expression of microRNA156 and thus pro-
mote the maturation of juvenile plants (Yu et al., 2013).
Important sugar responses are also found in roots, 
whose growth depends on Suc transported from pho-
tosynthetic leaves. This dependence underscores the 
importance of understanding the effects of sugars on 
root growth and development. Although sugar controls 
primary and lateral root growth in a dose-dependent 
manner (Freixes et al., 2002), sugar demand in roots 
continuously changes due to environmental signals 
(Lemoine et al., 2013) and developmental stages. Having 
a sugar-sensing system in roots that can efficiently 
monitor sugar levels would be important for root and 
whole-plant growth. However, studies of sugar signaling 
in roots are generally scant.
Root growth is closely associated with sugar con-
centrations (Thompson et al., 2017). Greater soluble 
sugar content has been found in fast-growing roots 
of pruned barley plants, whereas slow-growing barley 
roots contain less soluble sugar (Farrar and Jones, 
1986). Suc generated by photosynthesis in cotyledons 
is required to regulate primary root growth (Kircher 
and Schopfer, 2012). Suc promotes primary root elon-
gation in a dose-dependent manner. The higher the 
exogenous Suc concentration, the faster primary roots 
elongate (Freixes et al., 2002). Furthermore, the find-
ing that neighboring secondary roots in the same root 
system have different growth rates in their elongation 
zone as a function of local sugar concentration also 
favors the conclusion that sugar is a major determinant 
of root growth (Freixes et al., 2002).
Because local sugar concentrations play critical roles 
in regulating root growth, it is important to learn more 
about the mechanisms that control sugar transport 
into the growing zones of the root. Sugars generated 
by photosynthesis in leaves are loaded into sieve 
elements of the phloem and then delivered by phloem 
into roots (De Schepper et al., 2013). According to 
pressure flow theory, it is the osmotic differential in 
phloem sieve elements that drives the bulk flow from 
source photosynthetic organs to sink organs such as 
roots. After sugar reaches its destination, it must be un-
loaded from phloem sieve elements into surrounding 
cells. Ross-Elliott et al. (2017) have proposed that after 
sugar reaches the connecting tissue between conduct-
ing phloem and sink tissues, called protophloem, it is 
unloaded into surrounding cells through funnel plas-
modesmata and then diffuses freely along a concentra-
tion gradient into cells of the root tip in a symplastic 
way. The unloading of sugar into the elongation zone, 
mitotic zone, and root cap accommodates the high- 
energy demands of fast-growing regions in roots. Here, 
we describe the effect of knocking out two of the eight 
members of the annexin gene family in Arabidopsis, 
namely ANN1 and ANN2, on the diffusion of sugars 
from the unloading zone to root tips, and we discuss 
how these two annexins play an important mechanistic 
role in post-phloem transport of sugars into root tips.
RESULTS
Inhibition of Primary Root Growth in ANN1 and ANN2 
Knockout Mutants Is Rescued by Exogenous Suc 
Independent of Its Osmotic Effects
In 3-d-old seedlings, all ANN1 and ANN2 knockout 
mutants (ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1) 
had primary root lengths that were significantly shorter 
compared to wild type when grown on agar plates 
containing no Suc (Fig. 1, A and B). However, these 
knockout mutants had the same hypocotyl lengths com-
pared to that in wild type (Supplemental Fig. S1). To 
rule out that the differences in primary root lengths 
were due to differences in germination, we also mea-
sured growth rates in both mutants and wild type 
under the same condition (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the 
root length data, the primary roots of ann1-2, ann1-3, 
ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 grew significantly slower 
compared to that in wild type.
This inhibition of primary root growth observed in 
ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants was rescued by 
2% Suc (Fig. 1, A and C). This rescue was not due to 
the osmotic effect of Suc in agar plates, since equimolar 
concentrations of mannitol did not rescue the primary 
root growth inhibition in ANN1 and ANN2 mutants 
(Fig. 1, A and D). Similar results were also found in 1% 
sorbitol and 1% o-methyl-Glc treatments (Supplemen-
tal Fig. S2, C and D), indicating that Suc functioned ei-
ther as a carbon source or a signal to rescue the primary 
root growth inhibition in ANN1 and ANN2 knockout

mutants. Since Suc can be catalyzed by invertase into 
Fru and Glc, we also tested 1% Glc and 1% Fru treat-
ments (Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Both Glc and 
Fru also rescued primary root growth inhibition in 
ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants.
Inhibition of Root Cap Development in ANN1 and ANN2 
Knockout Mutants Is Rescued by Exogenous Suc
As observed by light microscopy, knocking out 
ANN1 or ANN2 affected primary root structures of 
4-d-old ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 
seedlings when grown without Suc. Starch detection 
by Lugol staining revealed reduced layers of starch- 
containing columella cells in ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, 
and ann1-2/ann2-1 compared to that in the wild type 
(Fig. 2A). In wild type root caps, there are four layers of 
columella cells with Lugol-stained starch granules in 
them, whereas only three layers of columella cells were 
detected in ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutants. Also, 
unlike wild-type roots, the roots of ANN1 and ANN2 
mutants had no border-like cells around their root 
caps. These root cap defects in ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, 
and ann1-2/ann2-1 were rescued by 1% Suc (Fig. 2B). 
When grown with 1% Suc for 4 d, ann1-2, ann1-3, 
ann2-1, and ann1-2/ann2-1 roots showed four layers 
of starch-containing columella cells like those in wild 
type with border-like cells attached to the root caps.
Because Lugol staining (Fig. 2A) revealed similar 
levels of starch granules in ann1-2, ann2-1, and ann1-2/
ann2-1 when seedlings were grown without Suc, ann1-2 
was used as a representative line for all ann-mutants 
in subsequent quantification of root-tip starch levels 
(Fig. 3). Consistent with Lugol staining, ann1-2 dis-
played significantly lower levels of starch in root tips 
compared to that in wild type when grown without 
Suc (Fig. 3).

from primary roots of 2-week-old wild type, ann1-2, 
and ann2-1 grown without Suc in light revealed many 
differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the primary 
roots of the mutants. After the DEGs were assigned to 
gene ontology (GO) terms, the GO analysis in ann1-2 
revealed functional enrichment in photosynthesis with 
seven out of a total of 13 up-regulated GO categories 
related to photosynthesis (Supplemental Table S1). 
This indicated significant enhancement in the expres-
sion levels of photosynthetic genes in ann1-2 in the ab-
sence of exogenous Suc.
Although Arabidopsis roots partially turn green 
when exposed to light, the main energy source that fa-
cilitates root growth originates in the leaves (Kobayashi 
et al., 2012). Thus, we decided to assay transcript levels 
of photosynthetic genes in the cotyledons of 4-d-old 
ann1-2, and wild-type seedlings grown without Suc. 
We assayed 4-d-old seedlings because evidence shows 
that the dominant roles of sugar to regulate root growth 
are probably restricted to the first 5 to 6 d before leaf 
development (Kircher and Schopfer, 2012). Among all 
the genes in photosynthesis-related GO categories, 
the top five most up-regulated ones were selected to 
be analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR 
(RT-qPCR). Results showed that four out of five pho-
tosynthetic genes were significantly up-regulated in 
cotyledons of ann1-2 seedlings grown without Suc 
(Fig. 4A). These four genes encode chlorophyll-binding 
protein 2 (CAB2, LHCB1.1), chlorophyll-binding protein 
3 (CAB3, LHCB1.2), and two subunits of PSII light- 
harvesting complex (PSII, LHB1B1, and LHB1B2).

We also quantified the accumulation of chlorophyll in 
cotyledons of 4-d-old ann1-2 and wild-type seedlings 
grown without Suc. Consistent with the up-regulation 
of photosynthetic gene expression, cotyledons of 
ann1-2 seedlings showed significantly higher intensity 
of chlorophyll autofluorescence signal than that in 
wild-type cotyledons, indicating a higher chlorophyll 
content in cotyledons of ann1-2 seedlings compared 
to that in the wild type (Fig. 4, B and C).
Exogenous Suc reversed the enhanced expression of 
photosynthetic genes and chlorophyll accumulation in 
cotyledons of ann1-2 seedlings. When grown with 1% 
Suc, ann1-2 cotyledons showed similar photosynthetic 
gene expression levels as that in the wild type (Fig. 
4D), and accumulation of chlorophyll in these tissues 
was also comparable (Fig. 4, E and F).
Knocking Out ANN1 and ANN2 Induces Accumulation of 
Soluble Sugars in Primary Roots
We quantified neutral soluble sugars in primary roots 
of ann1-2, ann2-1 and wild type by gas chromatography/
mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using primary roots 
collected from 1-week-old seedlings grown on agar 
plates containing no sugars (Supplemental Table S3). 
Unexpectedly, significantly higher amounts of sugars

were detected in both ann1-2 and ann2-1 root tissue 
relative to that in wild type (Fig. 5A), including sig-
nificantly higher contents of soluble Glc (Fig. 5B) and 
Fru (Fig. 5C). Most of the sugar detected was probably 
in the phloem.
Knocking Out ANN1 and ANN2 Impairs Post-Phloem 
Transport in Root Tips
Because 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) 
has been widely used as a phloem-mobile probe (Oparka 
et al., 1994; Knoblauch et al., 2015), we used CFDA 
to detect post-phloem transport in wild-type, ann1-2, 
ann2-1, and the ANN1-overexpressing line 35S:ANN1. 
35S:ANN1 seedlings showed significantly longer roots 
compared to that in the wild type when grown without 
Suc (Supplemental Fig. S3). All seedlings were grown 
without Suc for 4 d. After applying CFDA on cotyle-
dons for 30 min, the dye was apparent in the two phloem 
files in primary roots of ann1-2, ann2-1, 35S:ANN1, and 
the wild type (Fig. 6A), indicating successful loading 
of carboxyfluorescein (CF). The wild type showed a 
characteristic transport pattern of CF along the root 
cortex (Fig. 6B). However, in ann1-2 and ann2-1, the 
diffusion of CF in root tips was restricted (Fig. 6B).
The post-phloem region has been defined as the 
region 250 μm behind the root tip (Stadler et al., 
2005; Ross-Elliott et al., 2017), so we quantified CF 
fluorescence in three different areas (transition zone, 
meristem zone, and root cap) of this post-phloem 
region in ann1-2, ann2-1, 35S:ANN1, and wild-type 
roots (Fig. 6C). Significantly lower levels of CF flu-
orescence were detected in both ann1-2 and ann2-1 
roots compared to that in wild type when seedlings 
were grown without Suc. This significant decrease of 
CF diffusion was more obvious in root caps, reach-
ing a level more than 50% less compared to that of 
wild type. In contrast to that in ann1-2 and ann2-1, 
35S:ANN1 showed significantly higher levels of CF 
diffusion in root tips compared to that in wild type 
by more than 50% in root caps. Taken together, these 
results indicate that ann1-2 and ann2-1 roots had 
impaired post-phloem transport; i.e. knocking out 
ANN1 and ANN2 restricted the diffusion of sugars 
from the phloem to the root tip.
Knocking Out ANN1 and ANN2 Increased ROS Levels 
and Callose Accumulation in Root Tips
Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate 
plasmodesmata permeability through callose depo-
sition (Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2009, 2011; Stonebloom 
et al., 2012). To test whether knocking out ANN1 and 
ANN2 leads to ROS accumulation in root tips, 2,7- 
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), 
a dye that stains hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was 
applied to 3-d-old seedlings grown without Suc. Sig-
nificantly higher levels of stain were detected in root 
tips of ann1-2 and ann2-1 compared to that in wild 
type when grown without Suc (Fig. 7, A and B). An-
iline blue was used to detect callose accumulation 
in root tips of 3-d-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 
seedlings grown without Suc, which revealed sig-
nificantly higher levels of callose deposition in ann1-2 
and ann2-1 compared to that in wild type (Fig. 7, 
C and D).
DISCUSSION
ANN1 and ANN2 Knockout Seedlings Show  
Suc-Dependent Phenotypes
The observation that significantly higher contents 
of soluble sugar were detected by GC/MS analysis 
in primary roots of ann1-2 and ann2-1 compared to 
those of wild type when grown together without Suc 
indicated there was successful phloem transport of 
sugar from shoots to roots in the knockout mutants, 
Figure 5.  ANN1 and ANN2 knockout mutant roots contain significantly more soluble carbohydrates in primary roots when 
grown without Suc. A to C, Primary roots were harvested from 1-week-old wild-type (Col-0), ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings 
grown on agar plates containing no Suc. Soluble sugar contents were analyzed by GC/MS to reveal total sugar (A), Glc (B), and 
Fru (C) contents. Values are means ± SD of triplicates. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated 
by Student’s t test (P < 0.05).

yet the mutants had obvious growth and columella 
cell defects. The fact that these defects were rescued 
by exogenous Suc independent of its osmotic effects 
suggested the possibility that ANN1 and ANN2 helped 
to regulate the post-phloem transport of Suc into root 
tips. Although successful unloading was detected in 
both the ANN1 knockout mutant ann1-2 and the ANN2 
knockout mutant ann2-1, the diffusion of CFDA into 
root tips was impaired in both ann1-2 and ann2-1, indi-
cating these mutants had restricted sugar diffusion in 
fast-growing regions from the unloading zone to root 
tips. These results are consistent with the conclusion 
that compromised expression of ANN1 and ANN2 
leads to impaired diffusion of sugars in the fast-growing 
root apex, and this, in turn, inhibits primary root growth. 
However, further studies quantifying carbohydrate 
content only in the cap region after laser microdissec-
tion are required to confirm this conclusion.
Sugar in Regulation of Photosynthesis
The regulatory roles of sugar in photosynthetic gene 
transcripts and photosynthesis capacity have been 
widely documented (Koch, 1996; Pego et al., 2000). 
Sugar starvation in plants activates photosynthesis, 
whereas high sugar levels inhibit photosynthesis (Yu 
et al., 2015; Sami et al., 2016). Sugar represses the tran-
scriptional activity of photosynthetic gene promoters 
transiently expressed in maize mesophyll protoplasts

(Sheen, 1990). Sugar accumulation in leaves represses 
photosynthetic gene expression and photosynthesis 
(Pego et al., 2000). Roots are typical sink organs. Sugar 
demands in young roots promote photosynthesis in 
leaves. For example, overexpression of the HIGHER 
YIELD RICE gene encoding an APETALA2/ETHYLENE 
RESPONSIVE FACTOR transcription factor leads to in-
creased root length, branching, and strength, which in 
turn promotes photosynthesis in leaves (Ambavaram 
et al., 2014). However, the mechanism of how plants 
monitor sugar levels in roots remains an active area of 
investigation. Here, we hypothesize that root tips are 
sugar-sensing tissues, and their sugar status can affect 
photosynthesis capacity in leaves.
As noted above, our results revealed sugar starva-
tion in the actively growing root apex of the ann1-2 
and ann2-1 knockout mutants by using CF as a phloem 
mobile probe. Evidence that this apical sugar star-
vation led to an up-regulation of photosynthesis was 
indicated by the up-regulated expression of genes en-
coding CAB2 (LHCB1.1), CAB3 (LHCB 1.2), and PSII 
subunits (LHB1B1 and LHB1B2), along with increased 
chlorophyll contents in ann1-2. The enhancement of 
photosynthesis in ann1-2 was most likely the change 
that resulted in the elevated sugar contents observed 
in primary roots of ann1-2. However, because these ac-
cumulated sugars could not reach the root apex due 
to the defective post-phloem transport of sugars in 
ann1-2, they failed to rescue primary root growth de-
fects and to reverse the enhancement of photosynthe-
sis. Assuming that sugars accumulate in the phloem 
and unloading zone without sufficient diffusion into 
the post-phloem region, this transport defect would 
lead to sugar starvation in root tips. Because roots can 
communicate their nutrient status to shoots and in-
duce responses in them (Ko and Helariutta, 2017), the 
stress of sugar starvation in root tips could initiate a 
root-to-shoot signal, just as salt stress in roots promote 
the propagation of Ca2+ waves from roots to shoots 
(Choi et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2016). Plausibly, such 
a signal could help explain how sugar-deprived root 
tips could induce the up-regulation of photosynthetic 
genes in leaves.
Roots efficiently take up Suc and Glc from the media 
(Chaudhuri et al., 2008), and consistently, exogenously 
supplied sugars in the medium successfully rescued 
primary root growth defects and reversed photosyn-
thesis enhancement in ann1-2. These results favor the 
conclusion that ANN1 helps control root sugar status, 
which would result in feedback regulation of photo-
synthesis. Knocking out ANN1 may result in sugar 
starvation in roots, which could serve as a signal for 
plants to up-regulate photosynthesis.
Post-Phloem Transport of Sugar to Root Tips
Apical sugar concentration in root tips has been 
considered to play the determinant role in regulating 
root growth and development (Freixes et al., 2002). 
The diffusion of CF in root tips of ann1-2 and ann2-1 
was restricted, whereas the ANN1-ovexpressing line 
35S:ANN1 showed promoted diffusion of CF. We in-
terpreted these results to indicate that knocking out 
ANN1 and ANN2 restricted symplastic diffusion in 
post-phloem transport from the unloading zone to root 
tips and that this restriction impaired primary root 
growth along with root cap development.
Sugar diffuses freely along the concentration gra-
dient through plasmodesmata in the root apex. It is 
now widely accepted that plasmodesmata are dy-
namic channels whose permeability is highly regulat-
ed during plant growth and development (Sager and 
Lee, 2014). Callose has been found deposited in the 
neck region of plasmodesmata and can restrict the size 
exclusion limit of plasmodesmata (Luna et al., 2011; 
Zavaliev et al., 2011). ROS accumulation can increase 
callose accumulation, which may result in reduced 
plasmodesmatal transport (Benitez-Alfonso et al., 
2009, 2011; Stonebloom et al., 2012).
ANNt1 has antioxidant activity (Gidrol et al., 1996), 
and this activity may help explain the results of prior 
studies that documented a link between ANN1 sup-
pression and an increase in ROS levels. For example, 
the knockout of ANN1 results in the accumulation of 
higher levels of ROS in leaves compared to that in wild 
type (Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2009). Similarly, our 
results show that knocking out ANN1 and ANN2 leads 
to hyperaccumulation of ROS in root tips, and, like 
earlier studies, associates this change with an elevated 
accumulation of callose. Assuming that some of this 
accumulated callose is deposited in plasmodesmata, 
it would restrict plasmodesmatal sugar transport and 
thus help explain why post-phloem transport of sugar 
to root tips is inhibited in mutants.
In conclusion, our results provide data linking ANN1 
and ANN2 to the regulation of primary root growth 
and development. This study expands our under-
standing of the function of annexins in plants to in-
clude an important role in the post-phloem transport 
of sugars to the root tip, which, in turn, indirectly im-
pacts photosynthetic rates in cotyledons.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Colombia (Col-0) ecotype was used as 
the wild type in all experiments. ANN1 (At1g35720) and ANN2 (At5g65020) 
are studied. Annexin T-DNA insertion mutants including ann1-2, ann1-3, ann2-1, 
ann1-2/ann2-1, and 35S:ANN1 used in this study were all obtained from 
Wang et al. (2015). All seeds were surface sterilized by 75% (v/v) ethanol for 
1 min and 20% bleach (v/v) for 10 min. After washing five times with sterile, 
deionized water, seeds were sowed on agar plates containing either no Suc, 
2% (w/v) Suc, or 1% (w/v) mannitol. Seeds on agar plates were stratified in 
darkness at 4°C for 3 d. Stratified plates were placed vertically in a growth 
chamber (Percival AR-66 L; light intensity of 275/µmol m−2 s−1, humidity of 
approximately 80%, 20°C) in continuous light or in darkness. Unless otherwise 
noted, chemicals were reagent grade from Sigma-Aldrich.
Lugol Staining of Columella Cells
Seedlings grown with 1% Suc or without Suc were submerged in a root cap 
fixative solution (5% [w/v] formaldehyde, 5% [v/v] acetic acid, and 25% [v/v] 
ethanol) for 24 h. Lugol staining of root caps was done as described by Hong 
et al. (2015). Ten to thirteen seedlings were imaged for each genotype with a 
DIC optics on a Nikon 90i Stereology microscope, using a 60× objective.
Starch Quantification
Starch levels in 2 mm root tips of 10-d-old wild-type and ann1-2 seedlings 
grown without Suc were assayed in ethanol extracts using methods described 
by Bergmeyer (1984), Barratt et al. (2009), and Divya et al. (2010).
RNA Extraction
Trizol reagent was used in all RNA extraction experiments following the 
manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA-Seq Analysis
To elucidate the mechanisms of ANN1 and ANN2 in regulation of primary 
root growth, we performed a comparative RNA-seq using total RNA from 
primary roots excised from 2-week-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seed-
lings grown without Suc in light. Total RNA extracted from primary roots of 
2-week-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown without Suc was 
submitted to the Genome Sequencing and Analysis Facility (GSAF) at the 
University of Texas at Austin. Both library construction and sequencing were 
performed by GSAF. After filtering low-quality reads and removing adaptor 
contamination from the raw data of Illumina reads, the following steps were 
as described by Van Verk et al. (2013) to detect differential expression in ann1-2 
and ann2-1 compared to Col-0. A cutoff value of a greater than 2-fold change 
in expression was used to select differentially expressed genes in ann1-2 and 
ann2-1.
To further investigate the biological functions of the DEG in both ann1-2 
and ann2-1, we subsequently assigned the DEGs to GO terms. TAIR10 was 
downloaded for gene function descriptions and GO annotations. Ture-path 
rule was applied in functional enrichment analysis. A gene annotated with 
a particular GO term was also annotated with all its parents. To avoid very 
generic, noninformative terms for analysis, only terms annotating 500 or fewer 
genes were retained. Genes annotated with a given specific GO term were 
considered as a gene set. All the gene sets were tested for the statistical signif-
icance of enrichment among themselves using the cumulative hypergeometric 
test. Then a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hoch-
berg, 1995) was also calculated. A false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 was 
used for significance.
RT-qPCR Analysis
cDNA was transcribed from RNA by the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse 
Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher) after DNase I digestion. Ten micrograms 
cDNA was used for each sample. RT-qPCR was performed on Quant-
Studio platform (Applied Biosystems) with PowerUp Sybr Green Master 
Mix (Thermo Fisher). Transcripts of cab2 (AT1G29920), cab3 (AT1G29910), 
LHB1B1 (AT2G34430), LHB1B2 (AT2G34420), ANN1 (AT1G35720), and ANN2 
(AT5G65020) under different conditions were studied. Primer sequences used 
in all RT-qPCR experiments to detect gene expression are listed in Supple-
mental Table S2. Specificity of gene amplifications were confirmed by melting 
curves. For each condition tested, three biological replicates for both wild type 
and ann1-2 with three technical replicates for each biological replicate were 
used. 2−ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) was used to calculate fold 
changes. For significant difference between each condition, either one-way 
ANOVA for three conditions or Student’s t test for two conditions was used.
Detection of Chlorophyll Autofluorescence
Cotyledons of 4-d-old intact ann1-2 and wild-type seedlings grown either 
with 1% Suc or without Suc were examined. Chlorophyll autofluorescence 660 
to 701 nm was detected with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Fifteen seed-
lings were examined for ann1-2 and the wild type.
GC/MS Analysis
Wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings were grown in continuous light 
on agar plates containing no Suc for a week. Primary roots were collected and 
washed in sterile water twice. After freeze drying for 2 d, samples were sub-
mitted to complex carbohydrate research center at the University of Georgia 
for GC/MS analysis. Triplicate experiments were carried out.
CFDA Application
CFDA stock was prepared as 6 mg/mL in acetone and kept at −80°C. A di-
lution of 1:20 in sterile water was used for application. Wild-type, ann1-2, and 
ann2-1 seedlings were grown on agar plates containing no Suc for 4 d. A coty-
ledon was grazed by fine tweezers to allow 1 µL CFDA to penetrate. All sam-
ples were excited by 488-nm laser. Fluorescence 500 to 566 nm was monitored.
ROS Detection
Three-day-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown without Suc 
were used. Whole seedlings were incubated in the buffer (30 mm KCl and 10 
mm MES-KOH, pH 6.15) with 50 µm H2DCFDA for 1 h in darkness at room 
temperature. Extra dye was washed three times by the buffer before confocal 
microscopy. All samples were excited by 488-nm laser. Fluorescence between 
517 and 527 nm was collected.
Aniline Blue Staining
Three-day-old wild-type, ann1-2, and ann2-1 seedlings grown without Suc 
were stained by aniline blue (Biosupplies) as described by Ross-Elliott et al. 
(2017).
Confocal Microscopy
Confocal imaging was done by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zesis 
LSM 710) in a set manner, starting with the same image acquisition settings 
and data processing for all experiments. Fluorescent signals in all samples 
were recorded in Z stacks. Z-project in Fiji was used to flatten Z stacks either 
with average intensity for better quantification accuracy or with maximum 
intensity for better focus in representative images. Relative fold change of flu-
orescent intensity was calculated by division of the mean fluorescent intensity 
in wild type. Student’s t test was used to calculate significant difference be-
tween samples. Fluorescence was quantified in a way to avoid size difference.
