One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical
loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to
perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and diﬃcult-to-eliminate machine compliance.
Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse
vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel
surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen
surfaces; and specimen-speciﬁc micro-CT-based ﬁnite element analysis to measure stiﬀness to prescribe force
levels that produce the same speciﬁed level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured
fatigue life for three groups (n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new
method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical
behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain,
the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9;
p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae
may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.
1. Introduction
A number of diseases, including osteoporosis (Bouxsein, 2003a;
Saito and Marumo, 2010) and type II diabetes (Janghorbani et al.,
2007; Vestergaard, 2007; Farr and Khosla, 2016; Rubin and Patsch,
2016), are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated
bone quality. That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes
to mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions
in bone mass (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006). Concerns over possible
changes in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensive
pre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments (Mosekilde, 1995;
Ominsky et al., 2011). In assessing bone quality, various mechanical
properties can be measured (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006; Turner and
Burr, 1993; Fyhrie and Christiansen, 2015), typically stiﬀness, strength,
toughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from
monotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic
(repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment if
such loading produces unique failure mechanisms (e.g. slow crack
growth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in
monotonic loading (Kruzic and Ritchie, 2008; Nalla et al., 2003). Bio-
mechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in a precise
manner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size
of the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance eﬀects that are
diﬃcult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test spe-
cimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic-
loading responses both serve to reduce statistical power (Brouwers
et al., 2009), which in turn can lead to inconclusive ﬁndings regarding
the role of bone quality.
As a result of these challenges, and because of the continuing in-
terest in bone quality (Bouxsein, 2003b; Seeman and Delmas, 2006),
there remains a need to reﬁne the experimental protocols for bio-
mechanical testing of small-animal bone specimens, particularly for

cyclic loading. Here, we report on a method for cyclic biomechanical
testing of the mouse lumbar vertebra ex vivo that has improved pre-
cision. This technique should help optimize statistical power in animal
experiments, thus improving the ability of researchers to detect me-
chanically relevant changes in bone quality due to aging, disease, or
treatment, particularly for any situation in which samples sizes are
limited in number.
2. Materials and methods
We ﬁrst present our new method in detail. Then, to demonstrate
utility, we describe results from cyclic testing experiments for three
groups (n = 5–6 per group) of L5 mouse vertebrae, comparing results
for our new method (referred to as “KFEA method”) against two existing
methods from the literature (referred to as “KEXP method” and “FMAX
method”) (Brouwers et al., 2009; Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman
et al., 1998; Haddock et al., 2004; Lambers et al., 2013; McCubbrey
et al., 1995).
2.1. Animals
Our experiments used L5 vertebrae obtained post-mortem from
male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) that were in the
control groups of various previous studies (unpublished). All original
studies, and this study, were approved by NASA Ames Research Center
(ARC) Animal Care & Use Committee, and all experimental testing was
conducted at NASA ARC. Ages of the mice ranged from 15 to 18 weeks.
After sacriﬁce, the L1-S1 spinal segment was excised from the mouse
with a scalpel via an anterior approach. The L5 vertebra was then se-
parated by slicing through the adjacent intervertebral discs, gently
cleaned of soft tissue, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X,
pH 7.4), and stored at −20 °C until specimen preparation.
2.2. Specimen preparation
Obtaining true plano-parallel surfaces, which is diﬃcult for such
small specimens (Brouwers et al., 2009), is important to ensure full
contact — and thus uniform compression — between the specimen
surface and loading platens. If plano-parallel surfaces are not achieved,
or if the loading platens are not perfectly parallel, local contact can
occur over just part of the specimen surface. This introduces unwanted
scatter in the mechanical response and perhaps also premature failure.
Thus, we developed a detailed method for this aspect of the specimen
preparation (Fig. 1). Each vertebra was aligned inside a 3D-printed
(Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es, Eden Prairie, MN), disposable jig
with a metal pin (diameter range 0.91 to 0.99 mm; length of 38 mm)
(Fig. 1A) and secured with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The
combined jig-bone construct was then positioned in a diamond-saw
microtome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany). Two
parallel cuts were made on the cranial and caudal surfaces under con-
stant irrigation to remove only the endplates (Fig. 1B), preserving the
maximum amount of bone tissue. A ﬁnal cut through the posterior
pedicles released the vertebral body from the jig (Fig. 1C).
2.3. Quantitative micro-CT imaging
After machining, specimens were imaged using quantitative micro-
CT (μCT 50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at a 10-μm
voxel size (55 kV, 109 μA, 1000 projections per 180°, 500 ms integra-
tion time) (Fig. 2). Specimens were returned to the freezer after ima-
ging. The micro-CT images of the whole specimen (cortical and trabe-
cular compartments) were then analyzed for height, minimum tissue
cross-sectional area (minimum value of tissue area at any cross-section,
over all cross-sections), and total bone volume fraction (BV/TV) (Im-
ageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0). Each specimen with cortices removed was then
evaluated
for

(Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp).
2.4. Calculating specimen-speciﬁc cyclic forces
We used a force-control loading protocol, which allows both creep
and damage to occur during cyclic loading. However, since the cyclic
loading response of bone appears to be determined by the magnitude of
the applied strain (as opposed to the magnitude of stress) (Nalla et al.,
2003; Keaveny et al., 1994a; Keaveny et al., 1994b), our protocol re-
quired us to calculate a specimen-speciﬁc level of applied force that
would result in the same level of initial apparent strain (calculated over
the entire specimen) for all specimens. Cyclic loading in force control in
this way should minimize scatter in the resulting fatigue life despite the
heterogeneity in size, shape, and microarchitecture of the mouse ver-
tebrae.
This protocol required measuring the overall vertebral stiﬀness
before starting the cyclic loading so that the prescribed apparent strains
(εmin and εmax) could be converted into specimen-speciﬁc levels of ap-
plied force (Fmin and Fmax). However, experimentally measuring stiﬀ-
ness for any bone is challenging due to diﬀerent types of machine
compliance errors, which can introduce both ﬁxed and random errors
(Odgaard et al., 1989; Odgaard and Linde, 1991; Keaveny et al., 1993;
Keaveny et al., 1997). The ﬁxed errors have implications for external
validity, but otherwise do not compromise comparisons within any
given experiment and are therefore oftentimes acceptable. However,
large random errors compromise statistical power, particularly when
sample sizes are < 10 per group. Thus, to circumvent any errors asso-
ciated with machine compliance, we used a computationally derived
stiﬀness (KFEA) that was obtained from specimen-speciﬁc, micro-CT-
based, linearly elastic, voxel-based ﬁnite element analysis. The models
used 10-μm sized cube voxels, and assumed a nominal value of 10 GPa
for the tissue-level (voxel) elastic modulus for all specimens (see
Appendix A for details). The specimen-speciﬁc cyclic forces (Fmin; Eq. 1
and Fmax; Eq. 2) were then calculated for each specimen using KFEA, the
specimen height (H) as measured from micro-CT, and two assumed
nominal values of initial apparent elastic strain (εmin = 0.05% and
εmax = 0.5%):

The assumed value of εmax = 0.5% was chosen empirically by trial
and error based on earlier preliminary experiments on 6 mouse ver-
tebral specimens. There, we found that the resulting Fmax value was
approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force, which
generally placed a specimen in the middle region of its fatigue life. The
minimum initial elastic apparent strain value was chosen such that the
resulting Fmin values were near 1 N.
2.5. Mechanical testing
Within one week after imaging, specimens were thawed again to
room temperature and prepared for cyclic loading in uniaxial com-
pression to failure. The vertebral body was positioned onto the center of
the lower platen of the material testing device (TA ElectroForce 3200,
Eden Prairie, MN). Because obtaining perfectly parallel loading platens
can be challenging, the upper platen comprised a spherically-seated
platen on a lubricated ball-bearing which allows the platen surface to
rotate and mate ﬂush with the sample surface to achieve uniform
contact (Fig. 3); with the pre-load in place, the set screws on the upper
platen are locked. We used a compressive pre-load of 1 N, and after the
platen was locked room-temperature saline-solution (Gibco PBS 1X,
pH 7.4) was added to the bath until the specimen was fully submerged.
The pre-load was then adjusted to the predetermined Fmin, and then
sinusoidal cycles of compression between Fmin and Fmax were applied at

a frequency of 8 Hz until the specimen reached 10% strain, measured
via the actuation of the testing device platens.
2.6. Outcome measurements
Three plots were produced from each specimen fatigue test to deﬁne
outcome measurements. First, the force-displacement data were plotted
for each loading-unloading cycle, from which stiﬀness was deﬁned as
the secant stiﬀness, or range of force divided by range of displacement
per cycle (Fig. 4A). Second, the apparent strain per cycle was plotted,
and was separated into three curves representing total strain, creep
strain, and damage strain (Fig. 4B). The total-strain curve was used to
ﬁnd the number of cycles to failure, or fatigue life (Nf) and strain to
failure (εf) using the point of intersection between the curve and a 0.5%
line oﬀset parallel to a line of best ﬁt for the secondary region
(Brouwers et al., 2009; Bowman et al., 1998). Third, we plotted stiﬀness
per cycle (Fig. 4C) to identify three variables: elastic stiﬀness of the
specimen (Kelastic), stiﬀness at failure (Kf), and rate of stiﬀness de-
gradation. Elastic stiﬀness was calculated as the average stiﬀness
over ± 500 cycles centered about the maximum value of stiﬀness
(Kmax), which typically occurred after a few thousand cycles of loading;
the stiﬀness at failure was deﬁned as the stiﬀness measured at cycle Nf;
and the rate of stiﬀness degradation (ΔK/ΔN) was calculated as the
slope of a line that best ﬁt the middle 50% of points in the range be-
tween Kmax and Kf. The ΔK/ΔN parameter reﬂected accumulation of
fatigue damage, larger values indicating a more rapid accumulation of
fatigue damage per loading cycle.
In addition to these fatigue parameters, we also calculated an ef-
fective elastic tissue modulus (Etissue, in GPa, Eq. 3). This was calculated
using both the experimental (Kelastic) and computational (KFEA) assess-
ments of stiﬀness, scaling with respect to the assumed nominal value of
the tissue-level modulus of 10 GPa in the ﬁnite element analysis:

2.7. Alternative methods for calculating specimen-speciﬁc cyclic forces
Two published methods were also implemented to demonstrate

vertebra is placed into the jig using a snugly ﬁt, metal alignment pin (gold) through the vertebral foramen (pin diameter 0.9–1 mm) and sits in a diameter-matched
channel. The spinous process is oriented into the jig's shallow well, which is then ﬁlled with PMMA (blue) to secure the vertebra. B: Once the PMMA is set, the pin is
removed and two plano-parallel cuts (red) through the endplates are made using a diamond-saw microtome (not shown). C: A scalpel cut (red) through the pedicles
releases the planed vertebral body. In the top, right corner an enlarged view of an L5 vertebrae and the cuts applied is shown. Readers can download the stl via the

utility of the new method. For the ﬁrst “KEXP method” (Brouwers et al.,
2009; Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman et al., 1998; Haddock et al.,
2004; Lambers et al., 2013), instead of using the ﬁnite element-derived
value of stiﬀness (KFEA), the experimental measurement KEXP was used.
Following literature protocol, KEXP was found by pre-loading the spe-
cimen in compression to 1 N, cycling between 1 and 10 N 20 times, and
using the slope from the force-displacement curve of the 20th cycle. All
other mechanical testing details were the same as for our new method
except for two diﬀerences in the KEXP method: 1) the upper platen used
was a rigid design (not adjustable); and 2) the cyclic frequency was
2 Hz. However, fatigue behavior of bone has been shown to be un-
altered for any loading frequency below 15 Hz (Laﬀerty, 1978;
Yamamoto et al., 2006).
For the second “FMAX method” (McCubbrey et al., 1995), Fmax was
calculated using the measured strength of the adjacent L4 vertebra,
obtained by monotonic compression to failure. The L5 strength was
estimated as the product of the L4 strength and the ratio of minimum
tissue cross-sectional areas (micro-CT) for the L4 and L5 vertebrae, and
Fmax was then calculated as 50% of the L5 force (See Appendix B,
Table 2 for further details). All other mechanical testing details were
the same as our new method.

2.8. Statistical analysis
The means and standard deviations of all outcome measurements
were compared between the new method versus the two literature
methods. To compare means, a one-way ANOVA was conducted, with a
Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test applied to evaluate signiﬁcant diﬀerences
(at p ≤0.05). To compare standard deviations, a Bartlett test was
conducted. Standard deviations were considered signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
with a F-ratio > 1.0 and p ≤0.05. Also, linear regression was used to
compare the relationships between maximum cyclic loading force and
log of fatigue life (equivalent to a traditional S-N fatigue curve) be-
tween the three methods. All statistics were performed using JMP
(v13.0, SAS Institute).
3. Results
Of all three methods tested, the new (KFEA) method produced the
lowest variation in fatigue life. The mean value of the applied force was
the same for all groups (22 N), but the standard deviation was lowest
for the new (KFEA) method ( ± 0.77 N), 8-fold and 7-fold lower than the
KEXP and FMAX methods (F-ratio = 5.5; p < 0.01; Fig. 5A), respectively.
Because of these larger variations in applied force for the literature
methods, the fatigue life displayed a negative S-N type relation with the
loading force (R2 = 0.73 both literature methods) but there was no such
correlation for the new method (R2 = 0.07; Fig. 6). Instead, for the new
method the fatigue life was approximately uniform across all specimens
(5.0 ± 0.2), and its standard deviation was 5-fold and 2-fold lower
than for the KEXP or FMAX methods, respectively (F-ratio = 4.9;
p = 0.008; Fig. 5A).
The new method also provided other measurements related to bone
quality, both of which displayed high uniformity across the specimens:
the eﬀective tissue elastic modulus, Etissue, was 5.83 ± 0.22 GPa and
the strain to (cyclic) failure, εf, was 3.20 ± 0.80%.
Three additional observations were noteworthy. First, compared to
the new method, the average fatigue life was lower for the KEXP method
by 40.9% (p = 0.002) whereas fatigue life did not diﬀer for the FMAX
method (p > 0.90; Fig. 5A). Second, the elastic stiﬀness measured from
fatigue testing (Kelastic) was also lower for the KEXP method than the
FMAX method by 42.1% (p = 0.002), and than the new method by
44.8% (p < 0.001); stiﬀnesses for the FMAX and new methods were not
diﬀerent (p > 0.80; Fig. 5B). And third, the standard deviation for
stiﬀness was lowest for the new method (F-ratio = 4.53; p = 0.011;
Fig. 5B) compared to the KEXP and FMAX method. The diﬀerence in
stiﬀness variation between FMAX and the new method, which both used
the spherically-seated platen, shows that large variations in stiﬀness can
still exist even with the use of a pivotable ﬁxture, presumably due to
variable degrees of machine compliance.
4. Discussion
Our new method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae
yielded highly reproducible measurements of fatigue life and was suc-
cessful, in part, by eﬀectively controlling for the nominal level of strain
applied to these tiny bone specimens. Failure of bone in both static and
fatigue loading is largely thought to be strain-controlled (Nalla et al.,
2003; Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001; Keaveny et al., 1994c;
Schileo et al., 2008). To apply a repeatable initial strain to each spe-
cimen, a consistent measurement of stiﬀness must ﬁrst be obtained. Our
new method utilized specimen-speciﬁc micro-CT-based ﬁnite element
analyses to measure specimen stiﬀness and prescribe an individualized
cyclic force for each specimen. In turn, these individualized forces re-
sulted in a consistent starting level of strain applied to all test speci-
mens, and resulted in similar values of fatigue life. By contrast, our
implementations of the two literature methods were unable to con-
sistently apply the speciﬁed starting strain value, which produced more
scatter in the magnitude of the applied forces and an unintended S-N-
like relationship. The reduced level of scatter in fatigue life using this
method would be particularly helpful for studies limited to a small
sample size, such as in vivo animal experiments, to improve detection
in cyclic properties.
The consistency of our strain-to-failure results with those from other
studies supports the validity of our new approach. While the fatigue life
will depend on the level of loading, strain-to-failure is emerging as a
more uniform outcome across many diﬀerent cyclic loading experi-
ments. Our strain-to-failure (mean ± SD) value of 3.20 ± 0.80%,
from cyclic compression testing of mouse vertebrae, is consistent with

cyclic compression results for other species: 3.36 ± 2.13% for human
trabecular bone (Haddock et al., 2004), 2.85% ± 0.66% for bovine
trabecular bone (Bowman et al., 1998), and 4.19 ± 1.52% for rat
whole-bone vertebra (Brouwers et al., 2009). A similar value in cyclic
compressive strain-to-failure between these studies and ours might be
expected for two reasons. First, the bone material, primarily the col-
lagen component which dominates the plasticity and therefore strain-
to-failure of the bone (Burstein et al., 1975), is similar amongst the
species listed. And second, others have reported on relatively uniform
values for the strain-to-failure independent of apparent density, applied
loads, or temperature (Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001;
Keaveny et al., 1994c). While the absolute value of strain to failure will
be inﬂuenced by any machine compliance, the general level of agree-
ment and small degree of scatter suggests that bone tissue does indeed
fail at a narrow range of strain under cyclic loading, and that our
protocol was successful in reducing the variation in strain across dif-
ferent specimens.
Our ﬁndings also indicate that implementing a pivotable loading
platen to ensure uniform contact is important for accuracy of results, at
least for these small-animal bones. We observed a reduced Kelastic and
fatigue life for the KEXP method compared to the new method, even
though the specimens used in both protocols had similar size and mi-
croarchitecture (Appendix B; Table 1). We attribute these inconsistent
results to the rigid platen design used in the KEXP method testing. Even
with rigorous specimen preparation in place, we found that perfectly
plano-parallel loading surfaces on small bones cannot always be
achieved. And without an adjustable platen, the load can be localized to
an area that comes into contact with the platen ﬁrst, producing an ef-
fective stress concentration. This localized load can result in reduced
stiﬀness and the stress concentration in reduced fatigue life.
There are some limitations to this study. First, the bone tissue used
in this study was shared tissue, which did not allow for random as-
signment of animals across all groups, and thus it is possible specimens
diﬀered across groups. However, the similarity in size and structure of
specimen across all groups as per micro-CT analysis (Appendix B;
Table 1) suggests the only source of appreciable heterogeneity could be
in tissue material properties, which is unlikely because the animals
were of the same strain, sex, and approximate age. Second, the initial
strain values of (εmax = 0.5%) used for our new method may be speciﬁc
to this particular protocol, which assumed an eﬀective tissue modulus
of 10 GPa in the ﬁnite element analyses. The assumed value was chosen
empirically by trial and error on some preliminary test specimens, such
that the resulting Fmax values were approximately half of the directly
measured ultimate force. To use this method in other animal models,
large or small (e.g. rat, bovine, monkey), similar preliminary testing to
determine the value of εmax is suggested, particularly if it is suspected
that the eﬀective tissue modulus might diﬀer from mouse vertebrae. We
recommend using an elastic strain level that is associated with about
half of the ultimate strength. Third, the values of the eﬀective tissue
elastic modulus reported here are speciﬁc to this experiment. Para-
meters such as temperature, loading frequency, and use of diﬀerent
platens, can all contribute to machine compliance and variation be-
tween tests, thus the eﬀective tissue modulus should not be considered
a true material property. Placing an extensometer across the platens
directly beside the specimen ends can minimize machine compliance
eﬀects. However, it is best to use the eﬀective tissue modulus as a
relative measurement to compare between untreated and treated spe-
cimens within an experiment, but not across studies (e.g. between
mouse and rat bones). Lastly, as with any laboratory-based biomecha-
nical testing, the loading conﬁguration does not mimic exact in vivo
conditions. Our removal of the endplate and loading via a rigid platen
versus loading via intact disc and endplate is a clear limitation. Thus,
while our results do not describe expected in vivo behavior, our pro-
tocol does produce highly repeatable results, which should help eluci-
date changes in bone quality characteristics by aging, disease, or
treatment.
The main application of our new method is to provide greater sta-
tistical power in using small-animal experiments to mechanically assess
relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or
treatment. A small sample size and scatter associated with the fatigue
testing present challenges for detecting statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects
unless those eﬀects are large. For example, Brouwers et al. (Brouwers
et al., 2009) found a 37.5% diﬀerence in steady-state creep rate and
15.7% diﬀerence in loss of stiﬀness with zoledronate treatment in an
osteoporotic rat model, but could not report a detectable signiﬁcance
due to high variation in the data and loss of some samples. Our KEXP
method was similar to their method, which produced standard devia-
tions in fatigue life (reported as “time-to-failure”) up to the same
magnitude as the mean value. Our new method should reduce that
range up to 8-fold. Furthermore, unlike in the Brouwers literature
protocol, we had no loss of specimens, enabled by repeatable specimen
preparation (e.g. 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel
surfaces) and uniform loading of specimen surfaces (e.g. spherically-
seated platen), which further improves statistical power, and can be
implemented for monotonic testing or fatigue testing of small-animal
vertebrae. That said, our new method is a time intensive process for
specimen preparation, micro-CT, image processing, and ﬁnite element
analysis. However, the extra eﬀort improves the ability to detect small
diﬀerences across treatment groups without using a large number of
animals, which is advantageous both ethically and also logistically
when sample sizes are inherently limited (e.g. space ﬂight experi-
ments). Thus, use of our new method may improve the ability of future
studies to elucidate mechanically relevant aspects of bone quality as-
sociated with aging, disease, or treatment.

Appendix A. Image processing
Image processing of the original micro-CT images was conducted prior to ﬁnite element analysis for each specimen. First, the image stack was
reoriented to align the specimen with the z-axis (DataViewer v1.5.2.4, Bruker). Second, the reoriented images were thresholded using the ‘Default’
Autothreshold algorithm in ImageJ (ImageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0_24). The ﬁnal stack was used to build the ﬁnite element model.
A.1. Finite element analysis
To determine the computational stiﬀness, high-resolution linear ﬁnite element analysis was performed. Each 10-μm cubic voxel in the images was

converted into an eight-noded brick element to create a ﬁnite element model of the entire vertebral body. All bone elements were assigned the same
elastic, homogeneous and isotropic material properties: elastic modulus 10 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3. These values are based on experimental
testing of core samples of trabecular bone from human vertebrae (Bevill and Keaveny, 2009). A varied modulus based on tissue mineral density and
thus micro-CT greyscale was not used in this methodology due to underestimation of apparent modulus using this approach (Kaynia et al., 2015).
Each model was uniaxially compressed to 2% apparent strain, the input was displacement which varied depending on specimen height. Typical
models contained approximately 1.5 million elements and were solved using a highly scalable, implicit parallel ﬁnite-element framework Olympus
(Adams et al., 2004) running on a Dell Linux Cluster supercomputer (Stampede, Texas Advanced Computing Center). The outcome was the whole-
bone reaction force, which was then used to calculate computational stiﬀness, KFEA (Eq. 4), by dividing by the input displacement.

Appendix B
Table 1
The KEXP and KFEA method specimen structural parameters indicate there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in specimen size and shape. There were
also no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the mean or standard deviations (F-ratio = 1.65; p = 0.20) of computed cyclic force between these two groups.
The computed cyclic loading force for KEXP group was retrospectively found to demonstrate the diﬀerence in standard deviation of cyclic loading
force computed with the KEXP method compared to KFEA method (F-ratio = 10.9; p < 0.01). The structural parameters from specimens of the FMAX
method are not compared to KEXP and FMAX method groups because of a diﬀerence in resolution of these micro-CT scans (20.7 μm). However, the
stiﬀness and fatigue life measurements are the same for the FMAX and KFEA methods, which suggest the structural parameters for the FMAX method
specimens were similar to those used in the KEXP and KFEA methods.

Structural parameters and resulting forces and fatigue life for L4 and L5 vertebrae used in testing the “FMAX method”. Max Stress
is calculated from the resulting maximum force found from monotonic testing of the L4 (i.e. σ = FL4/AL4). This maximum stress
is a material property and assumed to be the same for the adjacent L5 bone. The cyclic loading force applied to the L5 was
derived from this stress (i.e. Fapplied = 0.5(σ)(AL5)), labeled “50% of L5 Max Force” in the table. The range in applied force
calculated led to a larger standard deviation in fatigue life when compared to the new method KFEA.
