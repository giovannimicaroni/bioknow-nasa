Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic
acid (ABA) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen
species (ROS). ROS accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging levels within the
cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that have been implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been
debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a ﬂavonol-
speciﬁc dye. The expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE, a gene encoding a ﬂavonol biosynthetic
enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell-speciﬁc ﬂavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were detected
using a ﬂuorescent ROS sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4-2, which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore
synthesizes no ﬂavonol antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid ABA-induced closure than the wild type,
suggesting that ﬂavonols may dampen the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closing. The levels of ﬂavonols are positively
regulated in guard cells by ethylene treatment in the wild type, but not in the ethylene-insensitive2-5 mutant. In addition, in both ethylene-
overproducing1 and ethylene-treated wild-type plants, elevated ﬂavonols lead to decreasing ROS and slower ABA-mediated stomatal
closure. These results are consistent with ﬂavonols suppressing ROS accumulation and decreasing the rate of ABA-dependent stomatal
closure, with ethylene-induced increases in guard cell ﬂavonols modulating these responses.
Guard cells use an extensive signal transduction path-
way to regulate the aperture of stomata, pores on the
surface of leaves that facilitate gas exchange and water
loss (Roelfsema and Hedrich, 2005; Joshi-Saha et al., 2011).
CO2, a necessary reactant for photosynthesis, enters leaves
through stomata, whereas water can leave through these
same pores via transpiration. Excess water loss can lead to
dehydration of the plant when there is excess heat or
drought. Guard cells therefore must modulate the sto-
matal aperture in response to the changing environment
(Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2007). In response to stimuli
that close stomata, such as drought stress, the hormone
abscisic acid (ABA) is increased in the cytosol of guard
cells (Zeevaart, 1980; Hirayama and Shinozaki (2007)).
ABA induces ion movements across the cell membrane
expelling K+ and Cl2 ions through ion efﬂux channels.
The decreased internal solute concentration drives water
out of the cell via osmosis (Vahisalu et al., 2008). The loss
of water from guard cells decreases the volume of the cell,
with the resulting loss of turgor closing the stoma (Joshi-
Saha et al., 2011). Additional understanding of this ele-
gant signaling pathway will provide insight into how
plant growth and development is modulated by changes
in soil moisture, temperature, and light levels.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are one important class
of signaling molecules that has been implicated in guard
cell signaling (Guan et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Jiang
and Zhang, 2002, 2003). The well-documented role of
ROS in causing oxidative stress is now joined with
growing evidence that ROS may play integral roles as
secondary messengers in signal transduction pathways
(Wood et al., 2003; Rhee, 2006; Mittler et al., 2011; Munné-
Bosch et al., 2013). At high concentrations, ROS, such as
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can cause oxidative damage
to DNA and proteins that are integral to normal cellular
processes (Asada, 2006; Van Breusegem and Dat, 2006);
however, at low levels, H2O2 is an effective signaling
molecule in guard cells that can induce stomatal closure
(Pei et al., 2000; Murata et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001;
Kwak et al., 2003). Elevated ABA in guard cells triggers
H2O2 production through activation of NADPH or res-
piratory burst oxidase enzymes located on the plasma
membrane (Mustilli et al., 2002; Yoshida et al., 2002) and

mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana respiratory burst oxidase D
(AtrbohD) and AtrbohF, show impaired ABA-regulated
stomatal closure (Kwak et al., 2003).
The ability of signaling-regulated synthesis of H2O2
to alter the activity of speciﬁc target proteins has been
shown in mammalian systems (Rhee, 2006). This
oxidant, generated from superoxide O2
.2 molecules,
can modulate the activity of phosphatases and kinases,
causing dynamic changes in signal transduction path-
ways (Poole et al., 2004). Speciﬁcally, H2O2 can interact
with speciﬁc Cys residues, transforming the functional
group of the Cys into sulfenic acid, altering formation of
disulﬁde bonds between two separate proteins or be-
tween nearby Cys residues of the same protein, in a
transient, reversible fashion (Poole et al., 2004; Poole and
Nelson, 2008). In guard cells, this ROS burst is believed
to target calcium channels to promote the inﬂux of cal-
cium across the plasma membrane and the release of
calcium from internal stores (McAinsh et al., 1996; Allen
et al., 2000; Cho et al., 2009). Increased cytosolic calcium
levels induce activation of anion efﬂux channels located
on the plasma membrane (Hedrich et al., 1990; Schroeder
and Hagiwara, 1990; Chen et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013),
triggering stomatal closure. The mechanism behind ROS
activation of Ca2+ channels in mammalian systems has
been well studied (Poole and Nelson, 2008); however,
less is known about this mechanism in plants.
When maintained at manageable levels, ROS are efﬁ-
cient and reversible signaling molecules employed by
cells to regulate the activity of enzymes and transcription
factors; however, if levels of these molecules become
excessively elevated, they can cause oxidative stress
(Hernández et al., 2009; Pollastri and Tattini, 2011).
Therefore, mechanisms that keep their levels from be-
coming too high and allow their accumulation to be
transient are important features of ROS signaling. ROS
homeostasis is tightly regulated in plants through the
production of a variety of enzymatic and small molecule
antioxidants (Mittler et al., 2004). Flavonols are plant
metabolites that may function as antioxidants in plants
and in animals that consume them (Hernández et al.,
2009). Although their antioxidant activity in planta has
been debated, previous studies have shown that the anti-
oxidant capacity for ﬂavonols in vitro is greater than that
of vitamin C or E, two well-documented in planta anti-
oxidants (Rice-Evans et al., 1997). Guard cells provide an
elegant system to test the antioxidant ability of ﬂavonols,
owing to the well-documented function of ROS as a sec-
ond messenger in this cell type (Pei et al., 2000; Murata
et al., 2001; Kwak et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2009).
This study examined the accumulation of ﬂavonols in
guard cells and the role of ﬂavonol accumulation in
controlling the levels of ROS. A ﬂavonol-speciﬁc dye and
a reporter construct driven by a promoter from a gene
encoding a ﬂavonol biosynthetic enzyme revealed the
localized accumulation of ﬂavonols and the expression of
this gene that drives their synthesis in guard cells, but not
in surrounding pavement cells. Mutants that make no
ﬂavonols are used to demonstrate the speciﬁcity of the
ﬂavonol-speciﬁc dye, and to show the effect of ﬂavonols
on ROS status and stomatal aperture. Finally, the induc-
tion of ﬂavonol synthesis in guard cells in response to
ethylene was examined, as well as the effect of these
regulated changes in ﬂavonol concentration on stomatal
aperture. These results indicate that ﬂavonols suppress
ROS levels within guard cell modulating stomatal aper-
ture and with changing environmental conditions mod-
ulating ﬂavonol synthesis and guard cell signaling.
RESULTS
Flavonols and Their Biosynthetic Machinery Are Found
in Guard Cells
To determine whether ﬂavonols accumulate in guard
cells, we used diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester
(DPBA) dye to detect ﬂavonols. The speciﬁcity of DPBA
ﬂuorescence was demonstrated in Arabidopsis (Arabi-
dopsis thaliana) roots using mutants in ﬂavonol synthesis,
with no signal observed in the transparent testa4-2 (tt4-2)
mutant that makes no ﬂavonoids (Lewis et al., 2011) be-
cause of a mutation in the gene that encodes chalcone
synthase (CHS), the ﬁrst step in the ﬂavonoid biosyn-
thesis pathway. The DPBA ﬂuorescence of the surface of
an Arabidopsis leaf, with and without a differential in-
terference contrast (DIC) overlay of pavement cells,
illustrated localized accumulation of ﬂavonols in guard
cells with no signal in surrounding pavement cells (Fig. 1,
A and B). This pattern was observed in more than 50
leaves. We also asked whether the ﬂavonol localization
was restricted to guard cells as a result of ﬂavonol bio-
synthesis in those cells. Epidermal leaf peels of transgenic
plants with a CHS promoter driving a GUS reporter were
visualized by bright-ﬁeld microscopy. GUS product ac-
cumulated in the epidermal guard cells (Fig. 1C), with no
GUS product accumulation in surrounding pavement
cells. This reporter is expressed in additional cell layers in
cross sections of whole leaves (Chory and Peto, 1990).
These results were consistent with tissue-speciﬁc signals,
including transcriptional controls of ﬂavonol synthesis,
restricting ﬂavonol accumulation to guard cells.
To more quantitatively and precisely image DPBA in
leaf tissue, we optimized laser scanning confocal micro-
scope (LSCM) settings in order to spectrally separate total
ﬂavonol ﬂuorescence from chlorophyll autoﬂuorescence.
Using the basal surface of a whole Arabidopsis leaf,
confocal micrographs showed autoﬂuorescence of chlo-
rophyll in the blue channel and DPBA staining in the
yellow channel (Fig. 2). The absence of the DPBA signal
in tt4-2 guard cells conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of this
staining in leaf tissues, complementing the previous
studies in roots (Buer and Muday, 2004; Lewis et al.,
2011). This image indicated that we can resolve these two
ﬂuorescent signals and that ﬂavonols accumulated in
the cytosol, but not the chloroplasts of guard cells. It was
also evident that DPBA ﬂuorescence was greater in the
regions of the guard cell that appeared to be nuclei,
a cellular location that exhibited ﬂavonoid accumulation
in other plant cells types (Feucht et al., 2004; Saslowsky
et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2011). Veriﬁcation of nuclear

ﬂavonol accumulation was completed by simultaneously
imaging DPBA and Hoechst 33258, a nucleic acid stain
(Supplemental Fig. S1). After imaging DPBA with spec-
tral separation, we imaged the same guard cells using
single-channel microscopy to visualize Hoechst ﬂuores-
cence and consistently observed that the region of bright
DPBA staining in the center of each guard cell also had
nucleic acids, as detected by Hoechst, consistent with a
nuclear accumulation of ﬂavonols.
The levels of DPBA ﬂuorescence in the cytosol and nu-
cleus of the wild type and tt4-2 were quantiﬁed in 90 guard
cells and are reported relative to the levels in the cy-
tosol of ecotype Columbia 0 of Arabidopsis (Col-0; Fig. 3A).
DPBA ﬂuorescence was at background levels in tt4-2,
whereas wild-type plants had a robust DPBA ﬂuorescent
signal, with approximately 2-fold higher intensity in the
nucleus than in the cytosol.
Flavonol Accumulation in Guard Cells Affects
ABA-Induced Stomatal Closure
To analyze the functional signiﬁcance of ﬂavonol ac-
cumulation in guard cells, we compared ABA-dependent
stomatal closure in wild-type and tt4-2 guard cells. Be-
cause ABA triggers a ROS burst in guard cells and ﬂa-
vonols reduce ROS concentrations, we expected ﬂavonol
concentrations in guard cells to be inversely proportional
to the rates of ABA-induced stomatal closure. Leaves
were excised and incubated with 20 mM ABA for 0, 45,
90, or 180 min. At the indicated times after treatment,
epidermal peels were generated and DIC images were
captured and used for measurement of stomatal aper-
ture. Apertures were quantiﬁed in 30 stomata for three
separate experiments (Fig. 4). Although tt4 and the wild
type showed similar aperture in opening solution, the
initial ABA-induced stomatal closure response was
greater in tt4 guard cells than the control, with all aper-
ture values signiﬁcantly different than the wild type (P ,
0.05). The apertures of stomata were also quantiﬁed in
the absence of ABA under identical conditions over the
same time course in these two genotypes. The guard cells
remained open under these conditions and there were no
detectable differences between the wild type and tt4-2
(Supplemental Fig. S2). We also examined the effect of
3 h of ABA treatment on DPBA ﬂuorescence in guard cells,
mirroring the time course of ABA in the stomatal clo-
sure assays to ask if ABA altered ﬂavonol synthesis. The

Flavonols Suppress Reactive Oxygen Species in Guard Cells

DPBA signal was not altered by ABA during this 3-h
treatment (Supplemental Fig. S3). These results were
consistent with the absence of an antioxidant in tt4-2
guard cells that leads to an increase in signaling via ROS.
Elevated Ethylene Levels through Exogenous Treatment or
in the ethylene-overproducing1 Mutant Increase
Flavonol Accumulation
Because elevated ethylene levels were previously
shown to increase ﬂavonol accumulation in Arabidopsis
roots (Lewis et al., 2011), we asked whether there is
similar regulation in guard cells. DPBA ﬂuorescence was
examined in the ethylene-overproducing1 (eto1) mutant
(Chae et al., 2003) and enhanced ﬂavonol accumulation
was observed in the guard cells (Fig. 2). The DPBA ﬂu-
orescence intensity was quantiﬁed in 90 stomata and
average ﬂuorescence is reported relative to the values in
the cytosol of Col-0 (Fig. 3). There is a .1.6-fold increase
in DPBA ﬂuorescence in the cytosol and a .1.5-fold in-
crease in the nuclei of eto1 guard cells compared with the
wild type (Fig. 3; P , 0.001).
To further examine the effect of ethylene on ﬂavonol
synthesis in guard cells, we treated plants with exogenous
ethylene. The wild type and the ethylene-insensitive2-5
(ein2-5) mutant, an ethylene signaling mutant with nearly
complete ethylene insensitivity (Alonso et al., 1999), were
treated with 5 mL/L ethylene gas for 24 h, and then DPBA
ﬂuorescence in the guard cells was imaged (Fig. 5). The
DPBA ﬂuorescence was quantiﬁed in both the nucleus
and cytosol, as described above, for 30 stomata per
treatment in three separate experiments, and the average
signal relative to the signal in the cytosol of untreated Col-
0 was calculated (Fig. 5). Similar to eto1, the guard cells of
ethylene-treated wild-type plants had enhanced DPBA
ﬂuorescence in the cytosol and nuclei compared with an
untreated control (P , 0.01). A similar magnitude increase
in DPBA ﬂuorescence was also evident after 3 h of ethyl-
ene treatment, as shown in Supplemental Figure S3A.
Guard cells of ein2-5 had signiﬁcantly lower DPBA ﬂuo-
rescence than Col-0 in both the cytosol and nucleus in the
absence of treatment (P , 0.02) and showed no increase in
DPBA ﬂuorescence after ethylene treatment (Fig. 5).
We employed HPLC together with mass spectroscopy
(LC-MS) to directly quantify concentrations of kaemp-
ferol and quercetin in whole leaves to examine the effect
of elevated ethylene levels on ﬂavonol concentration.
Hydrolyzed ﬂavonol samples extracted from 18 leaves
of 4-week-old Col-0, tt4-2, and eto1 plants were analyzed
to examine the total ﬂavonol pools of each compound.
The concentrations of ﬂavonols were detected in three

separate experiments, with a representative graph shown
in Figure 3. Flavonol extractions from whole leaves
showed 1.3- and 5-fold increased levels of accumulation
of kaempferol and quercetin, respectively, in eto1 com-
pared with the wild type. This experimental approach
could not demonstrate that ethylene-dependent increases
in ﬂavonols were localized speciﬁcally to guard cells, but
it did illustrate that the increases in total ﬂavonol con-
centrations mirror the ﬂuorescence increases in guard cells
observed with DPBA staining.
ROS Accumulate in Guard Cells and Are Affected
by Flavonol Concentrations
The concentrations of ROS are highly regulated in
guard cells and are an essential feature of rapid sto-
matal closure in response to ABA (Pei et al., 2000; Kwak
et al., 2003). ROS concentration within guard cells was
examined to determine whether ﬂavonols are acting as
antioxidants in vivo. To visualize ROS accumulation in
Arabidopsis leaf tissue, we used 2’,7’ dihydrodichloro-
ﬂuorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), a general ROS ﬂu-
orescent sensor (Halliwell and Whiteman, 2004). In the
past, this ﬂuorescent probe has been imaged with UV
light to visualize ROS in guard cells (Kwak et al., 2003);
however, we excited with a 488-nm laser, a wavelength
that is more frequently used when imaging this probe
(Halliwell and Whiteman, 2004). H2DCF-DA is taken up
by cells, in which internal cellular esterases cleave off the
diacetate functional group, preventing 2’,7’-dichloro-
ﬂuorescein (DCF) from diffusing outside of the cell. Upon
oxidation by ROS, DCF becomes ﬂuorescent. To mini-
mize any dye uptake difference or light-induced ﬂuores-
cence increases that can occur with this dye (Murata
et al., 2001), all incubation and imaging times and
settings were carefully maintained within each ex-
perimental comparison.
We used spectral separation through confocal micros-
copy to separate out chlorophyll autoﬂuorescence from
DCF ﬂuorescence in guard cells in epidermal leaf peels of
the wild type, tt4-2, and eto1 (Fig. 6). In all three geno-
types, DCF ﬂuorescence was at very low levels in pave-
ment cells, but accumulated in guard cells in both nuclei
and the cytosol, with greater ﬂuorescence in the nuclei,
mirroring the tissue and subcellular accumulation of ﬂa-
vonols. The levels of DCF ﬂuorescence in the cytosol and
nucleus of the wild type, tt4, and eto1 were quantiﬁed in
90 guard cells and values were normalized relative to the
levels in the cytosol of Col-0 (Fig. 6B). In the tt4 mutant,
which does not synthesize ﬂavonols, DCF ﬂuorescence
intensity was greater in both the cytosol and the nucleus
of guard cells compared with the wild type. Quantiﬁca-
tion of DCF ﬂuorescence indicated that there is a 2- and
2.5-fold increase in tt4-2 in the cytosol and nucleus, re-
spectively, compared with wild-type guard cells.
There were also lower levels of DCF ﬂuorescence in eto1
than in the wild type with reduction to 60% of the values
in the untreated wild type, consistent with the higher
levels of antioxidants in the presence of elevated ethylene.
Ethylene treatment for 24 h showed decreased ROS ac-
cumulation in the wild type (Fig. 6), with similar ROS
decreases observed after 3 h of ethylene treatment com-
pared with untreated controls (Supplemental Fig, S2B). In
tt4, there were increased levels of ROS detected at 24 h,
but not after 3 h of ethylene treatment compared with
untreated tt4 (Fig. 6). The 24-h ethylene treatment results
mirrored a previous report that ethylene induced ROS
accumulation in guard cells through activation of NADPH
oxidase AtRBOHF (Desikan et al., 2006). Together these
images suggested an antioxidant activity of ﬂavonols in
guard cells, by illustrating an inverse relationship between
ﬂavonol concentration and ROS levels using both mutants
to block ﬂavonol synthesis and treatments and mutants to
elevate ethylene levels and ﬂavonol accumulation.
Stomatal Closure Is Modulated by Ethylene Levels
The effect of 24 h of ethylene treatment of the wild type
and tt4 and in the untreated eto1 mutant was examined

guard cells with and without ethylene treatment. Intact soil grown
plants were incubated in ethylene gas at 5 mL/L concentration for 24 h.
DPBA ﬂuorescence intensity values were quantiﬁed and are reported
relative to the untreated Col-0 cytosol ﬂuorescence intensity. Asterisks
indicate signiﬁcant differences (P , 0.02) between the mutant and the
wild type within treatment. Number signs indicate signiﬁcant differ-
ences between treated and untreated controls within a genotype as
determined by the Student’s t test (P , 0.02). The average 6 SE of 90
stomata from three biological replicates are reported.

Flavonols Suppress Reactive Oxygen Species in Guard Cells

using the same above-described stomatal closure assay.
The closure at time 0, 45, and 90 min after ABA treatment
for 90 stomata from three experiments were quantiﬁed in
these three genotypes (Fig. 7). After incubation in the
opening solution for 3 h, all stomata were equivalently
open and in the absence of added ABA, remained
equivalently open (Supplemental Fig. S2). Ethylene-treated
wild-type and eto1 guard cells showed decreased closure
in response to ABA, whereas untreated tt4 shows the
most stomatal closure at each time point. When wild-type
plants were treated with ethylene for 3 h (Supplemental
Fig. S3C), similar results were observed. We expected that
tt4 would show no response to ethylene treatment, if the
only effect of ethylene is on ﬂavonoid synthesis; however,
we found that it does show a reduced stomatal closure in
the presence of 24 h of ethylene treatment, but not 3 h.
The stomatal aperture is still smaller in tt4-2 with ethylene
treatment than in Col-0 with ethylene, consistent with a
role for ethylene-mediated ﬂavonol synthesis in reducing
the rate of stomatal closure through modulation of ROS
signals. The difference in stomatal aperture in tt4 in the
absence and presence of 24 h of ethylene treatment sug-
gests the presence of a separate ﬂavonol-independent
pathway by which ethylene treatment facilitates stoma-
tal closure. The absence of this effect at 3 h suggests that
this may well be a secondary effect of extended ethylene
treatments.
DISCUSSION
Guard cells control the aperture of stomatal pores in
response to environmental ﬂuctuations, including varia-
tions in light intensity, moisture, and carbon dioxide levels
(Hetherington and Woodward, 2003). In response to en-
vironmental stress, the plant hormone ABA signals sto-
matal closure (Zeevaart, 1980; Hirayama and Shinozaki,
2007; Cho et al., 2009; Joshi-Saha et al., 2011). This sig-
naling pathway employs H2O2 as a ROS second mes-
senger (McAinsh et al., 1996; Murata et al., 2001; Zhang
et al., 2001; Kwak et al., 2003). During signaling of sto-
matal closure, ROS must reach a certain threshold to ox-
idize their targets (Kwak et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2009), but
must not reach levels that will cause oxidative damage
(Munné-Bosch et al., 2013). To prevent oxidative damage,
ROS signaling must be tightly regulated by small mole-
cule and/or protein antioxidants (Conklin et al., 1996;
Apel and Hirt, 2004), with antioxidants including gluta-
thione and ﬂavonoids. Recent reports demonstrated the
altered redox state and altered stomatal aperture in mu-
tants defective in glutathione synthesis (Okuma et al.,
2011; Munemasa et al., 2013). In this study, we tested the
hypothesis that ﬂavonols act as antioxidants that reduce
ROS concentrations in guard cells, thus modulating sto-
matal closure.

We examined where and how ﬂavonols accumulated
in the epidermal layers of leaves in order to better un-
derstand their role in cell signaling. Flavonol accumula-
tion was visualized through confocal microscopy, using
a ﬂavonol-speciﬁc ﬂuorescent dye, DPBA. In the wild
type, DPBA ﬂuorescence was localized to guard cells but
was absent in surrounding pavement cells, whereas it
was not detected in any cell types in the ﬂavonoid-
deﬁcient tt4-2 mutant. Localized ﬂavonol accumulation
in guard cells could be a result of localized synthesis or
selective import of these molecules into the cells. To ex-
amine whether ﬂavonol biosynthetic enzymes are syn-
thesized in guard cells in planta, a CHS:GUS transgenic
line was utilized. CHS promoter-driven GUS product
accumulated speciﬁcally in guard cells and not in sur-
rounding epidermal pavement cells, which suggests that
production of CHS, a key ﬂavonol biosynthesis enzyme,
is localized to Arabidopsis guard cells. This result is
consistent with previous research that shows the pres-
ence of transcripts encoding enzymes of ﬂavonol bio-
synthesis in guard cell protoplasts, including chalcone
isomerase, ﬂavanone 3-hydroxylase, ﬂavonol synthase1,
and ﬂavonoid 39hydroxylase (Pandey et al., 2010). This
result extends previous study in two ways. First, it
minimized the damage to cells that is the result of cre-
ating protoplasts, which may increase the expression of
ﬂavonoid biosynthesis genes in cells where they are not
normally produced (Dixon and Paiva, 1995; Winkel-
Shirley, 2002). Second, the available microarray data do
not have a pavement cell transcriptome for comparison
(Pandey et al., 2010). Using very different experimental
methods in Vicia faba, ﬂavonols were previously reported
to accumulate in guard cells and surrounding epidermal
cells (Schnabl et al., 1986; Takahama, 1988). Both reports
used spectrophotometric imaging of epidermal peels,
which limits the resolution of ﬂavonols accumulation in
individual cells. Using the highly localized accumulation
of DPBA ﬂuorescence, our results demonstrate that there
is a guard cell-speciﬁc ﬂavonol accumulation proﬁle in
Arabidopsis.
Because ﬂavonols accumulate speciﬁcally in guard
cells, we asked whether these molecules function as an-
tioxidants to reduce ROS concentrations. Flavonols have
been shown to have antioxidant activity in vitro; how-
ever, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated
(Rice-Evans et al., 1997; Hernández et al., 2009; Pollastri
and Tattini, 2011). Because ROS has been implicated as a
second messenger in guard cell signaling (McAinsh et al.,
1996; Murata et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001; Kwak et al.,
2003), we asked whether the presence of ﬂavonols af-
fected the ROS accumulation in guard cells. To visualize
ROS accumulation, we used DCFH-DA, a general ROS
sensor, and utilized spectral separation to remove chlo-
rophyll autoﬂuorescence. DCF ﬂuorescence was localized
to guard cells, similar to the DPBA ﬂuorescence pattern,
indicating that both ﬂavonols and ROS accumulate spe-
ciﬁcally in this cell type, but not in surrounding pavement
cells. In addition, we saw increased DCF ﬂuorescence in
tt4-2 mutants that synthesize no ﬂavonols, consistent
with the absence of ﬂavonols resulting in increased ROS
concentrations, which is also consistent with an antioxi-
dant activity for ﬂavonols in vitro.
DPBA ﬂuorescence were at higher levels in the nuclei
than the cytosol in all genotypes and treatments. This
observation is consistent with characteristics of other
plant species that showed ﬂavonoid and ROS accumu-
lation in the nuclei (Feucht et al., 2004; Mazars et al.,
2010; Lewis et al., 2011). Immunolocalization with anti-
bodies against CHS and chalcone isomerase suggests
that the enzymes of ﬂavonoid synthesis are localized to
the nucleus in Arabidopsis roots (Saslowsky et al., 2005).
The nuclear localization of ﬂavonols is consistent with
the notion that ROS can regulate gene expression
through interaction with redox-sensitive transcription
factors (TFs) in plants (Wu et al., 2012), such as the well-
established redox-sensitive TF described in bacteria and
mammals (Aslund et al., 1999; Biswas et al., 2006).
Flavonols are a likely candidate to modulate the activity of
redox-sensitive TFs, because of their increased accumu-
lation in the nuclei; however, it is unlikely that they are
the only antioxidant present in this organelle. Flavonols
have been shown to chelate metal ions, such as Fe3+,
which catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals from
H2O2 (Hernández et al., 2009). Thus, ﬂavonol accumu-
lation in the nucleus would contribute to a decreased
redox potential in the nucleus, potentially decreasing the
number of TF oxidation events. Combined with our data
suggesting an in planta antioxidant ability of ﬂavonols,
we hypothesize that ﬂavonol accumulation in the nuclei
may modulate the activity of redox-sensitive TFs that
affect gene expression in addition to preventing oxida-
tive damage to DNA, although the time scale of tran-
scriptional effects may be beyond the rapid regulation of
guard cell aperture.
Because stomatal apertures are environmentally reg-
ulated, we hypothesized that regulation of ﬂavonol

Flavonols Suppress Reactive Oxygen Species in Guard Cells

synthesis may be a way for plants to modulate the
physiology of guard cells. Previous studies have shown
that ethylene increases ﬂavonol accumulation in Arabi-
dopsis roots (Buer et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 2011), and we
asked whether this hormone may also increase ﬂavonol
accumulation in guard cells. Elevated levels of ethylene
through endogenous overproduction in the eto1 mutant
and exogenous application of ethylene to wild-type
leaves increased ﬂavonol accumulation in this cell type,
as visualized by localized DPBA ﬂuorescence. We ob-
served robust increases in DPBA ﬂuorescence at both 3
and 24 h after treatment with ethylene gas. This ethylene-
enhanced ﬂavonol accumulation pattern requires a
functional ethylene signaling pathway, because the
ethylene-induced DPBA ﬂuorescence increases were
lost in the ein2 mutant. A previous study showed that
ethylene-induced
ﬂavonoid
increases
detected
by
DPBA can also be detected by LC-MS (Lewis et al.,
2011). We therefore veriﬁed these ﬂavonols increases in
leaves using LC-MS and detected approximately 5-fold
increases in quercetin and a smaller, but still statistically
signiﬁcant, increase in kaempferol in whole leaves treated
with ethylene under similar conditions.
We also observed decreased DCF ﬂuorescence in the
wild type and tt4 treated with ethylene for 3 or 24 h as
well as in eto1 guard cells compared with the wild type,
suggesting that the increase in ﬂavonols decreases ROS
concentrations. In addition, ethylene-treated wild-type
guard cells and eto1 exhibited a decreased rate of ABA-
induced stomatal closure, a result that is consistent with
ﬂavonols acting as antioxidants reducing the H2O2
burst that drives stomatal closure.
Ethylene has been shown to promote both stomatal
closure in Arachis hypogaea and Arabidopsis (Pallas and
Kays, 1982; Desikan et al., 2006) and stomatal opening in
Dianthus caryophyllus, Solanum lycopersicum, V. faba, and
Arabidopsis (Madhavan et al., 1983; Levitt et al., 1987;
Tanaka et al., 2005). Applied ethylene gas or its precursor,
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, was shown to
induce stomatal closure through elevated ROS production
generated by AtRBOHF, an NADPH oxidase (Desikan
et al., 2006). In our study, a previously reported ROS
burst that was observed upon ethylene treatment of wild-
type guard cells (Desikan et al., 2006) was masked by
increased ﬂavonol accumulation, but we observed that a
24-h ethylene treatment of tt4 led to elevated ROS (al-
though this increase was not detected after 3 h of treat-
ment), consistent with the absence of antioxidants. Other
researchers report that treatment of wild-type plants with
ethylene or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid or
endogenous ethylene overproduction in eto1 inhibit sto-
matal closure in the presence of ABA in Arabidopsis
(Tanaka et al., 2005) and in wheat (Triticum durum; Chen
et al., 2013). These ﬁndings are mirrored in our results,
with decreased ROS and stomatal closure in response to
ethylene treatment or the eto1 mutation. We predicted
that ethylene-treated tt4 might be insensitive to the effect
of ethylene on stomatal aperture, because there will be
no change in ﬂavonoid antioxidants. We found that in
both the wild type and tt4, ethylene reduced the rate of
stomatal closure, consistent with a ﬂavonoid- and ROS-
independent ethylene regulation of this process, al-
though the tt4 mutant has a greater rate in both cases
consistent with a second ROS-dependent mechanism.
A ROS-independent pathway for ABA-induced stomatal
closure was previously suggested (Kwak et al., 2003).
ABA treatment of atrbohD/F double mutant guard cells
resulted in no change in ROS concentrations, although
cytosolic Ca2+ elevations were observed in nearly
one-half of all guard cells (Kwak et al., 2003). We hy-
pothesize that a 24-h ethylene treatment may inhibit
ROS-independent stomatal closure in the absence of
ﬂavonols, which would explain the delayed closure that
is observed in ethylene-treated tt4. Our results suggest
that ethylene induces ﬂavonol accumulation, which re-
duces both the concentration of ROS and the rate of
ABA-induced stomatal closure.
We have constructed a model to synthesize these data,
which is shown in Figure 8. This model outlines the ABA
signaling pathway in which ABA activates respiratory
burst oxidases increasing the levels of ROS, which act as
signaling molecules to induce stomatal closure. Flavo-
noids act as antioxidants reducing the levels of ROS,
which decrease the rate of stomatal closure. Elevated
levels of ethylene, both through elevated synthesis in eto1
or by treatment with exogenous ethylene, increase
ﬂavonol accumulation and decrease ROS, resulting in
a reduced rate of stomatal closure. When a ﬂavonoid-
deﬁcient mutant is treated with ethylene, we ﬁnd that
ROS levels increase after 24 h of treatment, but not after
3 h of treatment. These ﬁndings suggest that extended
ethylene elevated ROS accumulation (Fig. 8, dotted line),
but that the elevated ethylene after ROS treatment in the
wild type more than compensates by increasing levels of
ﬂavonol antioxidants. We predicted that tt4 would be
insensitive to the effect of ethylene on stomatal closure,
whereas we found that this treatment leads to a reduced
Figure 8. A proposed model of the effects of ethylene and ﬂavonols on
stomatal closure. ABA is released into the cytosol where it triggers respi-
ratory burst oxidases, which induce a burst of ROS, which act as secondary
messengers to signal stomatal closure. Ethylene induces ﬂavonols accu-
mulation in guard cells through EIN2. Flavonols act as antioxidants to
scavenge ROS and thereby inhibits stomatal closure. In the absence of
ﬂavonols, ethylene induced ROS accumulation after 24 h, but not after 3 h
of treatment. Similarly, 24 h of ethylene treatment affected stomatal aper-
ture in tt4, whereas 3 h of ethylene treatment did not. The effects of ethylene
observed at 24 h are indicated with dashed lines. Arrows represent positive
effects and bars represent negative effects.

rate of closure, which is evident at 24 h, but not 3 h of
ethylene treatment (Fig. 8, dotted line). We hypothesize
that ethylene may enhance the synthesis of a second
signaling molecule that may act to alter stomatal closure
through a separate mechanism in the presence of ex-
tended ethylene treatment. Yet the absence of ethylene
effects on ROS and stomatal aperture after 3-h treatments
suggests that the primary effects of ethylene are on syn-
thesis of ﬂavonol antioxidants that suppress ROS levels.
CONCLUSION
Guard cell function is integral to plant adaptation to a
changing environment. Much is known about the role of
ROS as a second messenger in this cell type (Wang and
Song, 2008); however, the role of antioxidants in guard
cells to modulate ROS concentrations has not been well
studied. We observed ﬂavonol and ROS accumulation in
guard cells and showed that the concentrations of ﬂa-
vonols in planta are inversely proportional to ROS levels,
consistent with in vitro studies of ﬂavonols acting as
antioxidants (Rice-Evans et al., 1997; Hernández et al.,
2009). This study showed that ﬂavonol levels are ethyl-
ene regulated in guard cells. Elevated levels of ethylene
in response to exogenous treatment of the wild type and
endogenous synthesis in the eto1 mutant increase ﬂavo-
nol accumulation in guard cells, resulting in decreased
ROS levels and decreased rate of stomatal closure. To-
gether these results indicate that ﬂavonols suppress ROS
levels in guard cells and thereby modulate the dynamics
of stomatal aperture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Growth and Ethylene Treatment
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were germinated on 13 Murashige
and Skoog medium, pH 5.6, Murashige and Skoog vitamins, and 0.8% (w/v)
agar, buffered with 0.05% (w/v) MES and supplemented with 1% (w/v) Suc.
After vernalization at 4°C for 48 h, plates were placed in a 12-h day growth
chamber under 100 mmol m22 s22 cool-white light. Seedlings were transferred to
Metromix 360 soil 7 d after germination. All experiments were conducted on
leaves of plants that were 3 to 4 weeks after germination. This study utilized
ecotype Columbia 0 of Arabidopsis (Col-0), tt4-2 (Lewis et al., 2011), eto1 (Chae
et al., 2013), ein2-5 (Alonso et al., 1999), and a CHS:GUS reporter (Chory and
Peto, 1990).
For ethylene treatments, 4-week-old wild-type, tt4-2, and ein2-5 plants were
placed in a clear plastic container that was sealed with vacuum grease. Ethylene
gas was added to achieve a 5 mL/L concentration of ethylene within the chamber.
Control plants were placed in identical sealed containers without ethylene. After
either 3 h or 24 h of incubation, leaves were excised and used for imaging DPBA
or DCF ﬂuorescence, or in stomatal closure assays.
Flavonol Accumulation Using DPBA
Individual leaves were excised and submerged in an aqueous solution containing
0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2.52 mg/mL21 DPBA for 2.5 h. Whole leaves were
then washed in deionized water for 1 min and mounted in deionized water be-
tween two coverslips. A Zeiss 710 LSCM was used to excite the leaf surfaces with
100% maximum laser power at 488 nm and a pinhole yielding a 4-mm cross section.
We optimized LSCM settings to spectrally separate the ﬂuorescence of ﬂavonol-
DPBA and chlorophyll by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in
which there is no overlap. DPBA ﬂuorescence emission was collected between 475
and 619 nm (Lewis et al., 2011). The gain settings were selected to maximize the total
ﬂavonol signal while preventing oversaturation. All micrographs within each ﬁgure
were acquired using identical offset, gain, and pinhole settings using the same de-
tectors. Postimage quantiﬁcation of DPBA ﬂuorescence intensities was done by
placing a region of interest (ROI) around the nuclei of each guard cell and around an
area in the cytosol with no chloroplasts present. The average intensity values within
each ROI were recorded and averaged.
Histochemical Staining and Imaging of
CHS:GUS Activity
Whole leaves from the CHS:GUS transgenic line were excised and submerged
in a GUS staining solution (80 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 0.4 mM potassium
ferricyanide, 0.04 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 0.05% [v/v] Triton X-100, 0.8 mg/
mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-glucuronide, pH 7) at 37°C for 18 h. Leaves
were removed from staining solution and washed with 75% (v/v) ethanol for
5 min. Epidermal strips were prepared by spraying a microscope slide with a
silicone-based medical adhesive (Hollister stock #7730). After 5 min, the basal
epidermis of the leaf was gently pressed into the dried adhesive coat, and the leaf
was gently scraped with a pipette tip until only the ﬁxed epidermis remained
(Young et al., 2006). Epidermal peels were imaged using DIC imaging with a
Zeiss Auxio Observer D1 microscope with an AxioCam HRc color camera.
Quantiﬁcation of Flavonols by LC-MS
Samples were run on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL with an electrospray ionization
source, coupled to a Thermo Accela 1250 pump and autosampler (Thermo Fisher),
using a Security Guard column in line with a Luna 150 3 3 C18 column, both from
Phenomenex. For ﬂavonol analysis, 10 ml of each sample was injected with a solvent
of water:acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in the following gra-
dients: 95% to 40% (v/v) water from 0 to 5 min, 40% to 20% (v/v) water from 5 to
20 min, and 20% to 95% (v/v) water from 20 to 23 min to recondition the column.
MS2 fragmentation spectra of ﬂavonols were induced using 30-kV collision-induced
dissociation. Spectra of samples were compared to those of standards and those
listed on the MassBank database (www.massbank.jp). Data were analyzed by
quantifying peak areas using Thermo Xcalibur software, and with normalization to
the internal standard formononetin (Indoﬁne Chemicals). Absolute quantities of
metabolites were found by comparing peak area data to standard curves created
using pure standards of quercetin and kaempferol (Indoﬁne Chemicals).
DCF and Hoechst Staining and Quantiﬁcation
H2DCF-DA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to yield a 50-mM stock. This
was diluted in deionized water to yield a ﬁnal concentration of 2.5 mM with 2%
(v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The epidermis was stained for 15 min with two drops of
H2DCF-DA stain and washed with deionized water. A Zeiss 710 LSCM was used
to excite the leaf surfaces with 1% maximum laser power at 488 nm with a 3.5
digital gain. Settings were optimized to spectrally separate the ﬂuorescence of DCF
-ROS and chlorophyll by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in
which there is no overlap. The DCF signal was collected between 495 to 527 nm
with a pinhole yielding a 4-mm cross section, making sure to limit excess exposure
to the laser that induces ROS. The gain settings were selected to maximize the total
DCF signal while preventing oversaturation. All micrographs within each ﬁgure
were acquired using identical offset, gain, and pinhole settings using the same de-
tectors. DCF ﬂuorescence intensities were measured by placing an ROI around the
nuclei of each guard cell and around an area in the cytosol with no chloroplasts
present. The average intensity values within each ROI was recorded and averaged.
Hoechst imaging was performed on whole leaves that were previously
stained with DPBA. After 2.5 h of DPBA staining, leaves were washed in
deionized water for 1 min and transferred to an aqueous solution containing
Hoechst at a 1 mg/mL concentration. The leaf surface was excited with 10%
laser power at 405 nm and a pinhole yielding a 4 mm cross section. We op-
timized LSCM settings to spectrally separate the ﬂuorescence of the Hoechst
stain with cell wall autoﬂuorescence by capturing the emission spectrum for
each compound in which there is no overlap. Hoechst ﬂuorescence emission
was collected between 420 to 546 nm. The gain settings were selected to
maximize the total Hoechst signal while preventing oversaturation.
Stomatal Closure Assay
ABA-induced stomatal closure assays were performed with plants 3 to 4
weeks after germination. Leaves from untreated plants or plants treated with

ethylene gas for 24 h were excised and submerged in an aqueous opening
solution (5 mM KCl, 50 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MES buffer, pH 5.6) and incu-
bated under cool-white light for 3 h. To induce stomatal closure, leaves were
transferred to a similar opening solution with 20 mM ABA added to induce closure
(Jammes et al., 2009). After incubation in the ABA solution under white light
(100 mmol m22 s22) for 0, 45, 90, and 180 min, leaf peels were prepared and imaged
using DIC imaging with a Zeiss Axio Observer D1 microscope with a Hamamatsu
1394 ORCA-ERA monochromatic camera (Jammes et al., 2009). Apertures were
measured using ImageJ software.
