The
phosphoinositide
pathway
and
inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate
(InsP3)
have
been
implicated in plant responses to many abiotic stresses; however, their role in response
to biotic stress is not well characterized. In the current study, we show that both basal
defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants
constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP
5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca2+-release as well
as the expressions of some ﬂg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase
plants. Furthermore, the InsP 5-ptase plants were more susceptible to virulent and
avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. The InsP 5-ptase
plants had lower basal salicylic acid (SA) levels and the induction of SAR in systemic
leaves was reduced and delayed. Reciprocal exudate experiments showed that although
the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective molecules that could trigger PR-1
gene expression in wild type plants, exudates collected from either wild type or InsP
5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally,
expression proﬁles indicated that several defense genes including PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and
AIG1 were basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type.
Upon pathogen attack, expression of these genes was either not induced or showed
delayed induction in systemic leaves. Our study shows that phosphoinositide signaling
is one component of the plant defense network and is involved in both basal and systemic
responses. The dampening of InsP3-mediated signaling affects Ca2+ release, modulates
defense gene expression and compromises plant defense responses.

INTRODUCTION
Plants have developed a multilayered strategy to effectively con-
trol and combat pathogen invasion (Jones and Dangl, 2006). The
ﬁrst line of defense is triggered by the recognition of microbial-
or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMP or PAMP) by
the membrane associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
(Nürnberger et al., 2004; Delledonne, 2005). Pathogen triggered
immunity (PTI) also known as basal resistance (Jones and Dangl,
2006), is non-speciﬁc and against a range of virulent pathogens.
A series of rapid responses are initiated within seconds to min-
utes of encountering MAMPs including ionic ﬂuxes, production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of kinase cascades
followed shortly by transcriptional reprogramming (reviewed
in Postel and Kemmerling, 2009; Gimenez-Ibanez and Rathjen,
2010; Tsuda and Katagiri, 2010).
The second line of defense known as effector-triggered immu-
nity (ETI) involves recognition of speciﬁc pathogen avirulent
proteins by their counterpart plant disease resistance (R) pro-
teins located within the cell (reviewed in Jones and Dangl, 2006).
The local infected sites undergo programmed cell death to halt
pathogen growth as part of the hypersensitive response (HR). HR
also involves rapid ion ﬂuxes and production of ROS (reviewed
in Torres et al., 2006) as well as induction of pathogenesis-related
(PR) proteins. In addition to the local response, distal parts of
the plant develop immunity against a broad range of pathogens,
known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). A hallmark of SAR
is an increase in salicylic acid (SA). SA accumulates in both distal
and infected leaves in response to pathogen attack and treatment
with SA or SA analogs can induce the PR genes such as PR-1, PR-
2, and PR-5 (reviewed in Durrant and Dong, 2004; Fu and Dong,
2013). More recently several other metabolites have been impli-
cated as mobile signals in the development of SAR (Park et al.,
2007; reviewed in Kachroo and Kachroo, 2009; Gao et al., 2014).
A transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in) is one of
the early events associated with both PTI and ETI. The initial
increase in Ca2+ upon MAMP recognition is accepted to be
via an inﬂux through plasma membrane localized Ca2+ chan-
nels, such as cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGC) and/or

glutamate receptor (GluRs) channels. In addition, the involve-
ment of intracellular Ca2+ stores in the propagation of the
Ca2+ signal is very likely (reviewed in Ma and Berkowitz, 2007;
McAinsh and Pittman, 2009; Manzoor et al., 2012). Several
downstream defense related events are regulated by Ca2+ includ-
ing activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) cascades and modu-
lation of Ca2+ binding proteins (reviewed in Ma and Berkowitz,
2011; Wurzinger et al., 2011; Boudsocq and Sheen, 2013; Romeis
and Herde, 2014). The MAMP-triggered oxidative burst also
appears to dependent on the initial cytosolic Ca2+ elevation.
The NADP oxidase RbohD is directly and indirectly regulated by
Ca2+ (Sagi and Fluhr, 2006; Dubiella et al., 2013). In response
to elicitation with ﬂg22, early membrane depolarization events
are unaffected in the rbohD mutant (Jeworutzki et al., 2010) and
the cytosolic Ca2+ elevation is similar to wild type plants (Ranf
et al., 2011). A rise in cytosolic Ca2+ is also important for ETI
responses and may precede the oxidative burst in response to avir-
ulent pathogens (Grant et al., 2000). Furthermore, several Ca2+
or calmodulin (CaM) binding transcription factors TGA, CPB60g
and CAMTA3, (reviewed in Reddy et al., 2011) act as both posi-
tive and negative regulators of SA accumulation and SA-regulated
PR gene expression.
Many lipids and lipid related molecules are thought to play
roles in plant defense signaling and responses to both biotrophic
and necrotrophic pathogens (reviewed in Shah, 2005; Walley
et al., 2013). However, there is less information on the poten-
tial involvement of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in
plant defense. The membrane-associated phospholipids along
with the soluble inositol phosphates (collectively known as phos-
phoinositides) are present in all eukaryotic cells and are impli-
cated in plant responses to many environmental stimuli (see
reviews in Stevenson et al., 2000; Meijer and Munnik, 2003;
Krinke et al., 2007a; Im et al., 2010, 2011). In the canonical path-
way, phosphatidylinositol is sequentially phosphorylated to phos-
phatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinosi-
tol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) by the enzymes phosphatidyli-
nositol 4-kinase (PI4K) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate
5-kinase (PIP5K), respectively. Activation of phospholipase C
(PLC) in response to a stimulus or stress leads to the hydrolysis
of PtdInsP2 to generate the soluble second messenger inosi-
tol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). While
many aspects of the phosphoinositide pathway are conserved
in plants there are several differences between plants and ani-
mals (reviewed in Munnik and Nielsen, 2011; Delage et al.,
2013; Pokotylo et al., 2014). In plants, DAG is converted to
phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), while InsP3 maybe further phospho-
rylated to form inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6). Both InsP3
and InsP6 are thought to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores
(reviewed in Krinke et al., 2007a; Im et al., 2010; Gillaspy,
2011). Additionally, InsP5 and InsP6 are implicated in hormone
signaling via their interaction with the jasmonic acid recep-
tor COI (Sheard et al., 2010; Mosblech et al., 2011) and the
auxin receptor TIR1 (Tan et al., 2007), respectively. PtdOH
may also be generated by hydrolysis of structural phospholipids
such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE) via the phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes. Recent reports
implicate PtdOH as an important signaling molecule in plants
in both abiotic and biotic stresses (reviewed in Testerink and
Munnik, 2011). Using a transgenic inducible system to express
type III effectors (AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2) in planta, a bipha-
sic accumulation of PtdOH was reported involving ﬁrst PLC
and then PLD activation (Andersson et al., 2006). Furthermore,
activation of both PI4K and PLD has been shown to be
an early response of suspension cells to treatment with SA
(Krinke et al., 2007b, 2009). PtdOH-binding targets include the
NAD oxidase RbohD and MPK6 protein kinase and PtdOH is
implicated in ROS and HR responses (reviewed in Canonne
et al., 2011; Testerink and Munnik, 2011). Speciﬁc PLC iso-
forms may also regulate defense responses (Vossen et al., 2010;
Canonne et al., 2011). Arabidopsis mutants which have con-
stitutively low InsP6 levels exhibited an increased susceptibil-
ity to microbial infections (Murphy et al., 2008). Collectively
these results support the involvement of the phosphoinositides
in plant defense; however there are many missing links in our
understanding.
In this study, our goal was to further investigate the func-
tion of phosphoinositide-mediated signaling in the plant defense
network. In previous work, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis
plants expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-
phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), which speciﬁcally hydrolyzes soluble
inositol phosphates and terminates InsP3-mediated signals. These
InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants have normal growth and morphol-
ogy under optimal growth conditions. However, their basal InsP3
levels are greatly reduced, to only ∼5% of wild type level (Perera
et al., 2006). The InsP 5-ptase plants exhibit delayed and reduced
responses to gravity and impaired Ca2+ signaling in response to
salt and cold stimuli (Perera et al., 2006, 2008). The InsP 5-ptase
plants were also shown to be less resistant to wounding and her-
bivory (Mosblech et al., 2008). Interestingly, a global comparison
of basal transcript proﬁles between wild type and InsP 5-ptase
plants revealed that 16 out of 62 basally downregulated genes in
transgenic plants were defense related (Perera et al., 2008), includ-
ing PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and AIG1(avrRpt2- induced gene1). In the
current study, we demonstrate that InsP 5-ptase plants show
impaired Ca2+ elevation in response to ﬂg22, decreased expres-
sion of several defense related genes and delayed and reduced
SAR. Our results support the role of InsP3 as a mediator of
the intracellular Ca2+ cascade and highlight the involvement of
phosphoinositide-mediated signaling in the development of a
robust defense response in plants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR PLANTS AND BACTERIA
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the human type I inos-
itol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase generated via Agrobacterium
mediated transformation were generated previously (Perera et al.,
2006). Plants were grown in a growth chamber under 8 h
light/16 h dark, light intensity of ∼150 μmol m−2 s−1, 35–50%
humidity and temperature of 21◦C. All experiments were car-
ried out using 6–8 week old healthy well watered plants with
fully expanded leaves (prior to bolting). For most experiments,
wild type (Wt) and two independent transgenic lines (T6 and
T8), were tested along with the empty vector control (C2).

InsP3 in plant defense responses
Bacterial strains Pst DC3000 and isogenic lines carrying avr-
Rpt2 or avrRpm1genes were cultured at room temperature in
King’s medium B (40 g L−1 peptone, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 g
L−1 K2HPO4 and 1.5 g L−1 MgSO4, pH 7) containing 50 μg
ml−1 kanamycin, and 100 μg ml−1 rifampacin. The two non-
pathogenic strains, PstDC3000 with mutated effector protein
hrcC−and P. syringae pv. Phaseolicola 6, were also cultured at
room temperature on King’s medium B plates containing 100 ug
ml−rifampacin, and an additional 34 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol
for growing Pst DC3000 hrcC−.
PATHOGEN INOCULATION
For preparing bacteria used in pathogen inoculation experiments,
cells from an overnight culture were ﬁrst resuspended in 10 mM
MgCl2, and the concentration of bacteria was adjusted based on
the absorbance reading at OD600. The actual titer was also deter-
mined by counting serial dilutions on a selection plate after 48 h at
room temperature. To examine the growth of bacteria in planta,
leaves were inoculated either by hand using a 1 ml needle-less
syringe or by spraying with bacteria solution containing an addi-
tional 0.02% (v/v) silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX).
The bacterial titer was determined from 4 leaf discs (total area
is 1 cm2) collected from 4 separate leaves, (one leaf per plant).
Pooled leaf discs were ground in 10 mM MgCl2 in a ﬁnal volume
of 1 ml. The colony-forming units (cfu) were obtained by spot-
ting 2 μl of a serial 10-fold titrated bacteria onto King’s medium
B plates containing appropriate antibiotics and additional 50 μg
ml−1 cyclohexamine for preventing fungus contamination. In
each experiment, a total of 4 plants per line were used. For
statistical analysis either Student’s t-test or analysis of variance
(ANOVA) were performed.
FLAGELLIN TREATMENT
The elicitor ﬂg22 was synthesized by EZBiolab custom peptide
service (Westﬁeld, IN) based on the peptide sequence reported
in Felix et al. (1999). For root growth inhibition experiments,
0.1 μM of ﬂg22 was used which caused the half-maximal growth
inhibition in Arabidopsis seedlings reported in Gomez-Gomez
et al. (1999). For induction of ROS production in leaf discs, the
procedure was adapted from Gomez-Gomez et al. (1999) with
a ﬂg22 concentration of 1 μM. For induction of Ca2+ release
and qRT-PCR analysis of ﬂg22 responsive gene expression, 10 μM
ﬂg22 was used according to Navarro et al. (2004) and Zipfel et al.
(2004).
SAR ASSAY
To induce SAR, two fully expanded leaves of wild type and InsP
5-ptase plants were hand inoculated with avirulent strain Pst
DC3000+avrRpt2 (OD600 = 0.001; 7.5 × 105 cfu/ml). The un-
induced plants were mock inoculated with 10 mM MgCl2, (two
leaves per plant). Both induced and un-induced plants were then
separated into 4 groups for challenging with the virulent strain
PstDC3000 (OD600 = 0.004; 2 × 106 cfu/ml) at day 0, 1, 2, or 3
post inoculation by spraying the bacteria onto the whole plants.
To examine the development of SAR, systemic leaves sprayed with
PstDC3000 were collected. Leaf extracts were prepared and the
cfu was counted as described previously. The growth of virulent
bacteria in induced and un-induced plants was compared for
determining the level of SAR.
INOSITOL (1,4,5) TRISPHOSPHATE ASSAY
For measuring the InsP3 level of inoculated leaves, 4–5 plants per
experiment for each bacterial strain were grouped together and
sprayed with bacterial solution prepared as before. The treated
leaves were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Frozen tissues (around 0.08 g) were ground into powder in liquid
nitrogen and then incubated with 160 μl of 20% perchloric acid
on ice for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged to remove the debris
and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube followed by pH
adjustment to 7.5 using 1.5 M KOH/3 mM HEPES. InsP3 assays
were carried out using the TRK1000 InsP3 assay kit (Amersham-
Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (Perera et al., 2006).
SA MEASUREMENT AND APPLICATION
For analysis of total SA at the local inoculated leaves, plants
were syringe-inoculated with PstDC3000+avrRpt2, and inocu-
lated leaves were harvested at day 2 post inoculation. To extract
total SA (free SA + SA conjugates), the protocol described
in Nandi et al. (2004) was used. In brief, leaves were ﬁrst
ground into powder in liquid nitrogen, and then ∼0.2 g of
ground tissue was extracted ﬁrst with 90% methanol and again
with 100% methanol. The combined extracts were subjected to
evaporation under N2 gas. After evaporation, the residue was
ﬁrst resuspended in 5% trichloroacetic acid and then submit-
ted to acid hydrolysis by HCl at 100◦C for 30 min. SA was
extracted with cyclohexane:ethylacetate:isopropanol (50:50:1).
The organic phase was evaporated and resuspended in HPLC elu-
ent. Chromatography was performed on a 3.9 × 300-mm C18
reverse-phase μBondapak column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).
For exogenous SA application, SA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) was ﬁrst dissolved in ethanol, then diluted to 300 μM
in water with additional 0.02% (v/v) silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds,
Round Rock, TX), and the pH was adjusted to 7 with 0.1 M KOH.
For control solution, equal amount of ethanol without SA was
diluted in the same way. Solutions were gently and evenly sprayed
on plants. Treated plants were then kept in a growth chamber with
plastic covers until harvest.
CALCIUM-DEPENDENT AEQUORIN BIOLUMINESCENCE
The wild type and two independent InsP 5-ptase plants (T6 and
T8) expressing cytosolic aequorin (Knight et al., 1996) were cre-
ated previously (Perera et al., 2008). For measuring Ca2+ changes
after treatment with ﬂg22, 5-day old seedlings were ﬁrst incubated
with 2 μM coelenterazine (Molecular Probe®, Eugene, OR) solu-
tion in the dark for 16 h. Seedlings were transferred into tubes
containing water and placed in the luminometer and a base-
line reading was obtained. After 1 min, seedlings were treated
with 10 μM ﬂg22 which was injected automatically to avoid any
handling. The luminescence signals were recorded at 10 s inter-
vals for 35 min. The Ca2+ concentration were calculated after
measuring the discharged Ca2+ as described previously (Knight
et al., 1996; Perera et al., 2008). For monitoring the Ca2+ increase
after pathogen treatment, fully expanded leaves were ﬁrst inﬁl-
trated with 2 μM coelenterazine (Molecular Probe®, Eugene, OR)

solution and kept in the dark for 16 h, then the reconstituted
leaves were inoculated with Pst DC3000+avrRpm1 (OD600 = 0.5;
5 × 108 cfu/ml) or 10 mM MgCl2 mock solution. Immediately,
detached leaves were placed into a tube containing 100 μl water to
prevent drying out. The luminescence signals were recorded every
5 s for 3 h. The timing of the peak luminescence were taken for cal-
culation. Luminescence measurements were made using a Sirius
luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems GmbH, Pforzheim,
Germany).
CHEMILUMINSCENT AND IN SITU DETECTION OF ROS
For chemiluminescent detection of ROS, uniform leaf discs
were ﬁrst incubated overnight in sterile water in the dark.
Two leaf discs were placed in a test tube containing 105 μL
sterile water, with 1 μg horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 20 μM
luminol, and 1μM ﬂg22. Luminescence resulting from the
reaction between hydrogen peroxide, HRP, and luminol was mea-
sured for 35 min in Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection
Systems GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). For in situ detection
of ROS, plants were either sprayed or hand-inoculated with
PstDC3000+avrRpt2. Infected leaves were carefully removed at
6 or 48 h, and vacuum-inﬁltrated with fresh 0.1% (w/v) of 3,3′-
diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Lious, MO) dis-
solved in 0.01 N HCl. Inﬁltrated leaves were kept in the dark for
3 h, then de-stained in a destaining solution of 95% EtOH:85%
acetic acids: glycerol (3:1:1 in volume) and photographed.
RNA ISOLATION AND qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy plant mini kits (Qiagen,
Germantown, MD). For RT-PCR, the ﬁrst strand cDNA was
synthesized from total RNA using Ominiscript reverse transcrip-
tase (Qiagen) and random primers, and PCR of speciﬁc genes
was carried out using Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen).
For qRT-PCR, the ﬁrst strand cDNA was synthesized using
StrataScript QPCR cDNA synthesis kits (Agilent Technologies
Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and random primers, and the PCR reac-
tion was performed using Full Velocity SYBR-Green QPCR
Master mix (Agilent Technologies Inc.) on the Mx3000p ther-
mocycler (Agilent Technologies Inc.). Genes that were analyzed
from the Primary Library for Arabidopsis Pathogen-Inducible
Genes (cat# PR0100, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Lious, MO) are listed
in Supplementary Table 1. Primer sequences of other examined
genes are listed in Supplementary Table 2. The fold change in rel-
ative gene expression was calculated based on the 2−Ct method
(Schmittgen and Livak, 2008) using wild type as the normalizer
and ACT2 or PP2A as the reference genes.
PETIOLE EXUDATE EXPERIMENT
For collecting the petiole exudates, we followed the method
described in Maldonado et al. (2002) and Chaturvedi et al.
(2008). Leaves were hand inoculated with PstDC3000+avrRpt2
(OD600 = 0.01; 5.5 × 106 cfu/ml) or mock inoculation with
10 mM MgCl2. Treated plants were placed in the growth chamber
and covered with plastic lids. After 6–7 h, inoculated leaves were
cut from their bases and immediately dipped in 50% ethanol.
They were rinsed once brieﬂy with 0.0005% Clorox bleach and
then placed in 1 mM EDTA solution. A group of 10 leaves was
placed in a collection tube containing 2.5 ml of 1mM EDTA
and 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin, pH 8. They were kept in a covered
tray with wet paper towels at the base of the tray to maintain
the humidity in the growth chamber under continuous light.
After 16 h, collected exudates were diluted 2 fold with water, and
ﬁlter-sterilized before use.
RESULTS
THE RESPONSE OF InsP 5-ptase PLANTS TO ﬂg22
The bacterial elicitor ﬂagellin is a well characterized MAMP used
to investigate plant innate immunity responses. We ﬁrst treated
wild type and InsP 5-ptase seedlings with the active elicitor pep-
tide ﬂg22 and measured root growth. A greater inhibition of
root growth was observed in the InsP 5-ptase seedlings com-
pared to wild type (Figure 1A), indicating that the transgenic
plants are more sensitive to ﬂg22. We next monitored Ca2+ induc-
tion, ROS production and ﬂg22-associated pathogen-responsive
gene expression; which are all known to be triggered by ﬂg22
treatment in Arabidopsis (Gomez-Gomez et al., 1999; Asai et al.,
2002; Navarro et al., 2004; Zipfel et al., 2004; Boudsocq et al.,
2010; Ma et al., 2012). Treatment with ﬂg22 elicits a rapid rise in
cytosolic Ca2+ which can be monitored using aequorin-mediated
bioluminescence (Jeworutzki et al., 2010; Ranf et al., 2011). InsP
5-ptase seedlings expressing aequorin (Perera et al., 2008) were
treated with ﬂg22 and the intracellular Ca2+ changes were moni-
tored. Upon treatment with ﬂg22, a rapid rise in [Ca2+]cyt with a
peak at ∼2 min was observed in both wild type and InsP 5-ptase
plants; however, the induction level was greatly reduced in InsP
5-ptase plants (Figure 1B) with an average reduction in the Ca2+
signal of ∼44% in the transgenic plants (Figure 1C). As shown
by the root growth experiment (Figure 1A), the InsP 5-ptase
plants are responsive to ﬂg22; the increased root growth inhibi-
tion correlates with the attenuation of the Ca2+ signal. We also
monitored the oxidative burst (by measuring H2O2 generation)
after elicitation with ﬂg22. An increase in ROS was detected at the
ﬁrst 1–2 min post treatment, which peaked ∼5 min, and tapered
off returning to the baseline within 25 min (Figure 1D), which
was different from the sustained Ca2+ elevation (Figure 1B).
Surprisingly, there was no signiﬁcant difference in ROS gener-
ation between wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants. These results
demonstrate that although the Ca2+ release after ﬂg22 treatment
was dampened, the oxidative burst was not affected.
Our data suggested that the InsP 5-ptase plants could be a tool
to potentially distinguish between parallel downstream pathways
of MAMP-triggered immunity. In order to further investigate the
downstream responses, a group of genes known to be induced
by ﬂg22-FLS2 interaction (Asai et al., 2002; Qutob et al., 2006;
Gust et al., 2007; Boudsocq et al., 2010) were selected and their
expression levels were quantiﬁed by qRT-PCR. The ﬁve selected
genes were GST1, RLK, FRK1, NHL10, and MLO6. The peak
expression of MLO6 was at 30 min after ﬂg22 treatment, whereas
the other four genes showed a peak expression at 120 min post
ﬂg22 treatment (Figure 1E). Both wild type and InsP 5-ptase
plants, showed similar kinetics of induction; however, expression
levels at 120 min were signiﬁcantly reduced in the InsP 5-ptase
plants compared to the wild type. The reduction in expres-
sion suggests that the InsP 5-ptase plants are unable to sustain

or maintain maximal gene induction. Interestingly, FRK1 and
NHL10 are both considered to be regulated via MAPK depen-
dent pathways (Boudsocq et al., 2010) and these results suggest
a role for phosphoinositide signaling interacting with the MAPK

AVIRULENT STRAINS OF P. SYRINGAE
We next examined the interaction between the InsP 5-ptase trans-
genic plants and the plant pathogenic bacteria, P. syringae pv.
tomato (Pst) DC3000 which is widely used to study plant dis-
ease resistance (Nishimura and Dangl, 2010). In Arabidopsis,
PstDC3000 bacteria multiply rapidly and disease symptoms can
be observed ∼2 day post-infection with characteristic tissue
necrosis and chlorosis (Katagiri et al., 2002). Both virulent
and avirulent strains of P. syringae were used to evaluate the
susceptibility of InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants compared to wild
type.
Figure 2A shows that transgenic plants exhibited more severe
symptoms after infection with the virulent strain of P. syringae
(Pst DC3000). Moreover, when those infected leaves were har-
vested and bacterial concentration was quantiﬁed, the InsP 5-
ptase transgenic plants harbored more bacteria at OD600 = 0.001
and 0.0005 compared to the wild type, indicating they are more
susceptible to Pst DC3000 (Figure 2B). Similarly, the transgenic
plants also showed a slight elevated bacterial growth of the avir-
ulent strain PstDC3000+avrRpt2 at the low concentration of
inoculants OD600 = 0.0005 (Figure 2C). Compared to the wild
type the InsP 5-ptase plants are more susceptible to the aviru-
lent strain; however the response to the avirulent strain was not
as intense as the response to the virulent strain, suggesting that
the gene-for-gene defense mechanism is still functional.

InsP3 in plant defense responses
FIGURE 2 | The response of InsP 5-ptase plants to Pseudomonas
syringae. Leaves of Arabidopsis plants inoculated with Pst DC3000 at
OD600 = 0.001 (7 × 105 cfu/ml) were photographed at day 2 after inoculation
(A). Bacterial growth measured from plants at day 2 after inoculation with Pst
DC3000 (B) or PstDC3000+avrRpt2 (C). Starting bacterial cultures are
OD600 = 0.01 (8 × 106 cfu/ml), 0.001 (7 × 105 cfu/ml) or 0.0005
(3.5 × 105 cfu/ml). (D) Infected leaves used for RT-PCR were inoculated with
PstDC3000+avrRpt2 (OD600 = 0.001, 7 × 105 cfu/ml). RT-PCR was carried
out with gene-speciﬁc primers for PR-1 and Actin. (E) For bacterial growth
counts taken at day 4 after inoculation with the two non-pathogens,
PstDC3000+hrcC- (Pst hrcC-) and P. syringae pv. Phaseolicola race 6 (Psp
rc6), the concentration of inoculants were OD600 = 0.001 (7 × 105 cfu/ml).
Plant lines used were Wt (white), T8 (black), and the rps2/rpm1 double
knock-out mutant (gray). ∗P < 0.05.
We also compared the disease response of InsP 5-ptase plants
to that of rps2/rpm1 double mutants (lacking both of the Rps2
and Rpm1 R genes) which are equally susceptible to both virulent
and avirulent strains of PstDC3000 even at low concentrations of
inoculant. We found that transgenic plants were less affected than
the rps2/rpm1 mutants when challenged with avirulent strains
PstDC3000+avrRpt2; and did not have the same high level of
bacterial growth (Figure 2C). Therefore, the response of InsP 5-
ptase plants to PstDC3000+avrRpt2 is not similar to rps2/rpm1
double mutant which lacks the R gene mediated resistance. The
enhanced susceptibility pattern observed in InsP 5-ptase plants
is more similar to previously reported mutants with a defect
in SA-mediated disease resistance, such as nahG and eds16/sid2
mutants (Gaffney et al., 1993; Delaney et al., 1994; Dewdney et al.,
2000; Wildermuth et al., 2001). These plants with a defect in SA-
mediated resistance are more susceptible to avirulent bacterial
strains, but not so severely as to virulent bacterial strains, indi-
cating that the R genes in these mutant plants are not affected
(Dewdney et al., 2000). It is possible that the enhanced suscepti-
bility toward avirulent strains might be the result of dampened
signal transduction leading to disease resistance. To test this
hypothesis, we examined PR-1 gene induction as a downstream
response during the course of infection with PstDC3000+avrRpt2
at 3, 8, 24, and 48 h, and found that the two independent InsP 5-
ptase lines T6 and T8 show a delayed induction of gene expression
(the response was observed at 8 h instead of 3 h) compared to the
wild type and vector control plants C2 (Figure 2D).
To further demonstrate that basal defense is compromised, we
challenged InsP 5-ptase plants with a TTSS-defective hrcC mutant
of PstDC3000 (in which pathogen effector proteins are not deliv-
ered into host plants such that only a few bacteria multiply in wild
type plants). We found a slight elevation in bacterial growth in
InsP 5-ptase plants (Figure 2E), suggesting that the basal defense
in InsP 5-ptase plants was weakened. However, we did not observe
any bacterial growth or symptoms when challenged with the
non-host pathogen strain P. syringae pv. Phaseolicola strain race
6 in both wild type and transgenic plants, even after 12 days
(Figure 2E). These results suggest that the non-host resistance
mechanism in transgenic plants is not affected.
Previous microarray data indicated that a group of disease
resistance-related genes are basally downregulated under nor-
mal growth conditions in two independent InsP 5-ptase plants
compared to wild type and vector control plants. These include
PR-1, PR-5, and AIG1(avrRpt2- induced gene1), as well as genes

encoding proteins involved in Ca2+ storage in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) such as CRT3 and BiP3 (Perera et al., 2008). In
this study we used qRT-PCR to analyze a set of selected genes.
We determined that, in addition to previously identiﬁed defense-
related genes, PR-2, two putative glutathione-S-transferase genes
(GST11 and GST16) and three protein kinases (CRK7, CRK45,
and RLP23) were also basally downregulated in InsP 5-ptase
plants (Table 1). Among the eleven genes tested, eight of them are
also required for SAR according to the GO annotation in TAIR.
Although BiP3 has not been annotated as the other eight genes,
other BiP isoforms have been shown to play a role in promoting
plant immunity (Wang et al., 2005; Carvalho et al., 2014). The
data suggest that reduced expression of these genes might con-
tribute to the enhanced susceptibility of the transgenic plants to
P. syringae.
InsP3 CHANGES AND CALCIUM RELEASE DURING ETI
In order to determine whether InsP3 is induced in wild type plants
when infected with P. syringae, we examined InsP3 levels during a
6 h period of post spray with P. syringae in wild type Arabidopsis
leaves. When spray-infected with a virulent strain Pst DC3000,
InsP3 levels increased ∼two-fold at 4 h post spray (Figure 3A).
When infected with avirulent strains PstDC3000+avrRpm1 or
avrRpt2, InsP3 levels increased 2–3 fold at a shorter time, 20 min
and 1 h post spray, respectively. No change in InsP3 levels was
observed with mock spray (Figure 3A). These results demon-
strate that the induction of InsP3 is one of the signals generated
during plant-pathogen interaction. The difference in the induc-
tion times of InsP3 between virulent and avirulent pathogens is
in good agreement with the rapid induction of HR by avirulent
strains compared to the slower development of disease symptoms
by virulent strains (Katagiri et al., 2002).
In a previous study, a biphasic increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was
measured by aequorin-mediated bioluminescence in Arabidopsis
leaves infected with avirulent strains of PstDC3000+avrB or

avrRpm1 (Grant et al., 2000). We tested aequorin lines of wild
type and InsP 5-ptase plants infected with PstDC3000+avrRpm1.
We found that the early transient rise in [Ca2+]in was similar
in both wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants but there were differ-
ences in the second sustained increase in [Ca2+]in. The wild type
showed a peak of Ca2+ at 110 min post inoculation which is sim-
ilar to the previous report (Grant et al., 2000). In InsP 5-ptase
plants, there was a ∼20 min delay in the timing of the Ca2+ release
(Figure 3B) suggesting that InsP3-mediated signaling contributes
to the cytosolic Ca2+ increase observed in avirulent pathogen
infected leaves.
ROS PRODUCTION AND SA-MEDIATED SIGNALING DURING ETI
The oxidative burst in avirulent pathogen infected leaves is part
of the disease resistance mechanism (see review in Lamb and
Dixon, 1997). It leads to the generation of ROS, which pre-
sumably could conﬁne bacterial growth (see review in Torres
et al., 2006). To examine the ROS production in avirulent
pathogen infected leaves, we used 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
to detect ROS production in situ. Similar to the result observed
with ﬂagellin treatment (Figure 1A), no difference in ROS
production between wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants was
observed (Supplementary Figure 1). In both lines staining was
visible at 6 h and disappeared at 48 h either after inocula-
tion or spraying with PstDC3000+avrRpt2. The results demon-
strate that the HR-induced oxidative burst and ROS produc-
tion are unaffected in InsP 5-ptase plants and suggest that
ROS generation in plant ETI does not involve InsP3-mediated
pathways.
Because SA is a key systemic signal generated during
ETI, we compared the SA levels in wild type and InsP 5-
ptase plants (Figure 4A). We measured total SA including
the conjugated form. The basal SA level in transgenic plants
was ∼50% of the amount in wild type. After inoculating with
PstDC3000+avrRpt2, the SA levels increased in local inoculated
wild type leaves and to a lesser extent in the InsP 5-ptase leaves.
Although the SA reduction post inoculation in the transgenic
plants is not highly signiﬁcant (P = 0.1), the results do show
that the total basal SA in InsP 5-ptase plants was signiﬁcantly
lower compared to wild type. It was not impaired as much as in
nahG plants and sid2 mutants, but this low efﬁciency might be
enough to reduce the SA-mediated signaling and cause delay in
downstream gene expression, such as PR-1.
To further investigate whether the delayed PR-1 gene induction
observed in InsP 5-ptase plants (Figure 2D) was due to a delayed
response to SA, we applied exogenous SA and monitored PR-1
gene induction over a two day period. The wild type and vec-
tor control plants (C2) as well as two independent InsP 5-ptase
lines were treated with 300 μM SA by mist spray, treated leaves
were harvested at 0, 8, 24, and 48 h and PR-1 transcript levels
was monitored by RT-PCR (Figure 4B). Both InsP 5-ptase lines
have similar induction of PR-1 as wild type and C2 in response to
exogenous SA, suggesting that the InsP 5-ptase plants can respond
to SA similar to the wild type. The data suggest that the delay
in PR-1 gene induction is probably due to the delayed synthe-
sis of SA. This result excludes the possibility of InsP3 being an
intermediate between SA and PR-1 gene expression.

plants were sprayed with Pst DC3000 or Pst DC3000+avrRpt2 or +
avrRpm1 at a concentration of OD600 = 0.004 (2 × 106 cfu/ml). Mock spray
was 10 mM MgCl2. Treated leaves were harvested at different time points
and InsP3 was quantiﬁed. Data shown is the average of 5 independent
experiments ± SE. (B) Wild type (Wt) or InsP 5-ptase seedlings carrying
aequorin were reconstituted with coelenterazine and inoculation with Pst
DC3000+avrRpm1 (OD600 = 0.5, 5 × 108 cfu/ml) or mock solution (10 mM
MgCl2). A representative experiment is shown with luminescence counts
taken in every 5 s. The table lists the average time of the second sustained
Ca2+ peak (N = independent biological replicates).
THE SAR RESPONSE IN InsP 5-ptase PLANTS
In order to examine whether the reduced SA basal levels and
delayed PR-1 induction would compromise SAR in InsP 5-ptase
plants, we carried out an SAR assay (Zhang et al., 2010). Plants
were ﬁrst inoculated with PstDC3000+avrRpt2, (two leaves per
plant), and then challenged with PstDC3000 by spraying whole
plants at day 0, 1, 2, and 3 post ﬁrst inoculation. To monitor
the progression of bacterial growth in systemic leaves, bacterial
counts were measured in leaves at day 4 post spray. We found
that wild type plants acquired resistance to PstDC3000 around
day 3 post ﬁrst inoculation showing a reduced bacterial growth
compared to that at day 0, 1, and 2 (Figure 5A). Although the
bacterial growth in InsP 5-ptase plants also declined slightly at
day 3, the reduced growth is not statistically signiﬁcant compared
to that at day 0, 1, and 2. The assay result indicates that the SAR
response was affected in InsP 5-ptase plants. It could be that the
acquired resistance was not induced as much as in the wild type
at day 3, (i.e., a delayed response), or it could be that the level
of resistance was substantially reduced. No acquired resistance
was detected when plants were ﬁrst mock inoculated with 10 mM
MgCl2 (Figure 5B).
To investigate the expression levels of defense-related genes
during SAR induction in systemic leaves, we performed qRT-
PCR analysis over a time course. We ﬁrst inoculated plants with
PstDC3000+avrRpt2 (two leaves per plant), then the systemic
leaves were harvested at 3 h, 8 h, day 1, and day 2 post-inoculation.
We monitored expression of a total of 47 genes (for a complete
gene list see Supplementary Table 1). We found 14 genes that were
differentially expressed in the wild type and two transgenic plant
lines that were either only induced in the wild type or showed
reduced and delayed induction in the transgenic plants (Table 2,
calculated data are in Supplementary Table 3). Among these 14
genes, eight of them had low basal expression in the transgenic
plants. The remaining six genes, which were not basally low,
exhibited a reduced and delayed induction. These genes included
NHL10, RLK1, PAD4, and NIMIN-2, which are implicated in SAR
and SA-mediated signaling (Zhou et al., 1998; Li et al., 2004;
Navarro et al., 2004; Weigel et al., 2005). To further conﬁrm

the qRT-PCR result, we also performed an independent RT-PCR
analysis on systemic leaves (Figure 5C) using the marker genes
PR-1 and PAD4. The RT-PCR results were consistent with the
qRT-PCR data. The results indicate that the expression of a subset
of genes involved in SAR were altered, both in timing and extent
in the InsP 5-ptase plants.
SIGNAL MOLECULES GENERATED IN InsP 5-ptase PLANTS
The onset of SAR requires an array of mobile signals which are
generated from the primary infected leaves (reviewed in Gao
et al., 2014). These molecules are presumed to be translocated
from local inoculated leaves to distal leaves through the phloem
tissue. Phloem exudate collected from local leaves provides a
means to study the effects of the mobile signals. We performed
exudate experiments to examine whether the signal molecules
generated from the local infected leaves in wild type can trig-
ger the same response in InsP 5-ptase plants and vice versa. The
experimental design is to mimic the process of delivering sig-
nal molecules from primary infected leaves to systemic leaves by
bypassing the plant delivery system. The exudate from infected
plants containing putative signal molecules was collected and
injected into healthy uninfected plants. In these experiments, PR-
1 gene expression is expected to increase in the new leaves (similar
to systemic leaves) upon injection in response to the presence
of the signal molecules. We found that exudates collected from
InsP 5-ptase plants were equally effective in inducing PR-1 gene
FIGURE 5 | The SAR response is delayed in the InsP 5-ptase plants. The
SAR assay was carried out using wild type (Wt), vector control (C2) and two
independent InsP 5-ptase lines (T6 and T8). Plants were either ﬁrst
inoculated with Pst DC3000+avrRpt2 (OD600 = 0.001, 7 × 105 cfu/ml) (A),
or 10 mM MgCl2 mock solution (B), then sprayed with PstDC3000
(OD600 = 0.004, 2 × 106 cfu/ml) at day 0, 1, 2, or 3. Systemic leaves were
harvested and the bacterial growth was quantiﬁed at day 4 post spray. Data
is the average of three experiments ± SD. Each experiment has three
plants per line. Results from Wt and C2 (Wt/C2), and T6 and T8 (T8/T6)
were pooled for analysis. ∗P < 0.05 (C) Systemic leaves were also

expression in wild type plants as exudates from wild type plants
(Figure 5D). However, InsP 5-ptase plants showed diminished
PR-1 gene expression in response to exudates from either wild
type or transgenic plants. These results indicate that the genera-
tion of mobile signals at the primary infected site is not impaired
in the InsP 5-ptase plants and the exudates were as effective as
those produced in wild type. Since the response to exogenous
application of SA was also normal in the InsP 5-ptase plants
(Figure 4B), these results suggest that InsP 5-ptase plants are
affected in either sensing the mobile signal and/or in the synthesis
of SA at the systemic site.

Ca2+ increase and gene expression were affected, although ROS
generation was normal. Additionally, ETI responses occurring
at the local infected leaves were compromised in InsP 5-ptase
plants leading to a reduced and delayed induction of the systemic
response.
A reduction in basal InsP3 levels is the most dramatic and
direct consequence of the constitutive expression of InsP 5-ptase
in the InsP 5-ptase transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Perera et al.,
2006, 2008). It is reasonable to speculate therefore, that the inabil-
ity to propagate an InsP3 signal is the primary basis for the altered
defense responses exhibited by these plants. However, we cannot
rule out potential up and downstream effects of the increased
turnover of InsP3, since InsP3 is an intermediate in the phos-
phoinositide pathway and is linked to both the phospholipids
and the inositol phosphates. In previous work, we showed that
PIP5K activity and PtdInsP2 synthesis was upregulated in trans-
genic tobacco cells in suspension culture expressing InsP 5-ptase
(Perera et al., 2002). Under normal growth conditions, in our
hands, we have not detected a up regulation of PtdInsP2 syn-
thesis in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings or plants. It is possible
that the InsP 5-ptase plants have altered localized perturbations
in membrane phospholipids under speciﬁc conditions (such as
hydroponic growth, König et al., 2007) or in response to stimuli
such as pathogens.
InsP3 signaling in plants remains a controversial topic primar-
ily due to the fact that at a molecular level, an InsP3 responsive
Ca2+ channel (analogous to the animal InsP3 receptor) has not
been identiﬁed in plant genomes (discussed in Krinke et al.,
2007a; Munnik and Nielsen, 2011). Nevertheless, many studies
have demonstrated that InsP3 is a physiological ligand (reviewed
in Krinke et al., 2007a; Dodd et al., 2010; Pokotylo et al., 2014)
and InsP3 changes occur rapidly and transiently in response to
wide variety of both abiotic and biotic signals/stimuli (reviewed
in Krinke et al., 2007a; Im et al., 2010). It has also been sug-
gested that InsP6 rather than InsP3 is the ligand responsible for
Ca2+ release from intracellular plant stores (Lemtiri-Chlieh et al.,
2003). Since InsP3 is an intermediate in the lipid-dependent route
of InsP6 biosynthesis (reviewed in Gillaspy, 2011, 2013), increased
InsP3 turnover could be expected to affect InsP6 levels and indeed
the InsP 5-ptase plants have lower InsP6 levels compared to wild
type (Perera et al., 2008). Increased susceptibility to several micro-
bial pathogens was reported in low InsP6 mutants (Murphy et al.,
2008). However, (unlike the InsP 5-ptase plants), these mutants
had normal basal levels of SA and normal SA induction upon
infection. Therefore we cannot attribute all of the attenuated
defense responses of the InsP 5-ptase plants to a decrease in
InsP6. Other inositol phosphate intermediates, including InsP4
and InsP5 are implicated in stress responses (reviewed in Pokotylo
et al., 2014). It is conceivable that InsP6 (and/or other inositol
phosphates) act synergistically with InsP3 to mediate signaling
leading to defense responses.
ATTENUATION OF Ca2+ SIGNALS
It is clear that both PTI and ETI share similar signal transduc-
tion components and downstream targets (discussed in Ma and
Berkowitz, 2007; Tsuda and Katagiri, 2010) and may represent an
overlapping and interconnected network. The complexity of this
signaling network is illustrated by the convergence and crosstalk
between parallel branches (Boudsocq and Sheen, 2013). A rise in
cytosolic Ca2+ is one common signaling element in response to
both PTI and ETI and Ca2+ may be a primary signal essential for
initiating many of the early events; however there are differences
in the timing and duration of the PTI and ETI associated Ca2+
signals. Additionally there are feedback loops that modulate the
propagation of the Ca2+ signal (Ma and Berkowitz, 2007, 2011).
We showed that the InsP 5-ptase seedlings have a greatly atten-
uated Ca2+ signal in response to ﬂg22 compared to wild type
(Figure 1B). A similar result was reported using intact leaves
exposed to ﬂg22 (Ma et al., 2012). Intriguingly, the InsP 5-ptase
plants exhibited a normal Ca2+ response to the plant derived
peptide elicitor Pep3 (Ma et al., 2012). The Pep receptor PEPR
is linked to the cyclic nucleotide gated cation channel CNGC2
(Qi et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2012). Interestingly, the cngc2 mutant
showed an opposite Ca2+ response to the InsP 5-ptase plants;
an attenuated Ca2+ rise in response to Pep3 but a normal Ca2+
response to ﬂg22 (Ma et al., 2012). This result supports the
involvement of different pathways of Ca2+ inﬂux in response to
Pep and ﬂg22. It was suggested that Pep primarily targets extra-
cellular stores (via inﬂux by CNGC2) while ﬂg22 may involve an
additional contribution from intracellular stores. Detailed stud-
ies of the amplitude and kinetics of ﬂg22 dose-dependent Ca2+
changes also suggested that two processes or two different stores
may be involved in the ﬂg22 induced Ca2+ response (Jeworutzki
et al., 2010; Ranf et al., 2011).
A biphasic Ca2+ response was previously reported in response
to avirulent pathogens (Grant et al., 2000). Ma and Berkowitz
(2007) proposed that the initial pathogen-associated Ca2+ rise is
primarily via inﬂux from the apoplast while the subsequent Ca2+
rise is from intracellular stores. We observed that while the ini-
tial Ca2+ peak was similar to wild type, the timing of the second

which supports a role for InsP3 in sustaining and propagating the
pathogen-associated cytosolic Ca2+ signal.
Our results are consistent with a model in which InsP3 (and
or its derivatives) may act in an intracellular Ca2+ relay which
would be downstream of the initial Ca2+ inﬂux from the apoplast.
Because MAMP-triggered ROS was unaffected in the InsP 5-
ptase plants we propose that the initial rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in
response to MAMP elicitation may activate some downstream
targets (such as CDPKs) as well as trigger the early oxidative burst.
Alternatively, the ROS response may be “primed” by BIK1 in a
parallel Ca2+ independent manner (Kadota et al., 2014; Li et al.,
2014).
In plants several intracellular compartments serve as Ca2+
stores (reviewed in Dodd et al., 2010). The InsP3 responsive Ca2+
store is likely to be the ER or vacuole; however we cannot rule
out the involvement of the chloroplast (Manzoor et al., 2012).
A plant speciﬁc Ca2+ sensor protein CAS, which is located in
the chloroplasts, was recently shown to play a role in both PTI
and ETI (Nomura et al., 2012). There are shared similarities in
the response of the cas-1 mutant and the InsP 5-ptase trans-
genic plants in defense signaling, such as increased susceptibility
to both virulent and avirulent bacterial strains, basally reduced
PR-1 gene expression and normal ROS generation in response to
ﬂg22. However at present, we have no information on whether
InsP3 (and/or InsP6) may affect Ca2+ stores in the chloroplast.
The basal down regulation of PR genes and the reduced activa-
tion of PR gene expression in the InsP 5-ptase plants may also
reﬂect alterations in ER Ca2+ homeostasis as discussed further
below.
SA BIOSYNTHESIS AND SA MEDIATED SIGNALING
InsP 5-ptase plants have low basal SA (under normal control
conditions) and when infected with avirulent pathogens, SA lev-
els were lower than wild type plants at day 2 post inoculation
(Figure 4), suggesting that SA biosynthesis maybe reduced in
the transgenic plants. The reduced levels of SA in InsP 5-ptase
plants suggest a link between PI-metabolism and SA accumula-
tion/pathway through a yet unknown mechanism that ultimately
affects plant defense, either directly or indirectly. At a transcrip-
tional level, based on previous microarray results (Perera et al.,
2008), we have not detected lower expression of the two key
genes involved in SA biosynthesis, namely phenylalanine ammo-
nia lyase (PAL) and isochorismate synthase (ICS1), (Wildermuth
et al., 2001). ABA has been implicated as a negative regula-
tor of SA due to their overlapping biosynthetic pathways (de
Torres Zabala et al., 2009; reviewed in Cao et al., 2011). However,
we did not detect increased basal ABA levels in InsP 5-ptase
plants (Perera et al., 2008). Another possibility is that expres-
sion of genes encoding positive regulators of SA accumulation
(reviewed in Lu, 2009; Ng et al., 2011), could be impaired in
InsP 5-ptase plants, resulting in lowered SA levels. One of these
genes is PAD4, which showed a delayed induction in systemic
leaves (Table 2). Similar to InsP 5-ptase plants, mutants of this
group of genes have reduced SA accumulation and enhanced sus-
ceptibility to pathogens which could be rescued by exogenous
SA treatment (Zhou et al., 1998). Recent studies also point to
the involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) in modulating SA
biosynthesis. SARD1 and CBP60g, are two related transcription
factors which control SA biosynthesis by regulating ICS1 expres-
sion. Interestingly, CBP60g is a calmodulin-binding protein and

InsP3 in plant defense responses
its activity is Ca2+-dependent (Zhang et al., 2010; Truman and
Glazebrook, 2012). It is possible that the reduced Ca2+ response
in InsP 5-ptase plants might affect induction and accumulation
of SA via CBP60g activity.
ATTENUATED GENE EXPRESSION
We have reported that select early ﬂg22 responsive genes showed
reduced expression at 120 min in the InsP 5-ptase plants
(Figure 1E). We suspect that some downstream transcriptional
responses may require the continued propagation of the Ca2+
signal.
We have also shown that the InsP 5-ptase plants have
basally reduced levels of some defense-related genes (Table 1).
Additionally, induction of PR-1 was delayed in local leaves and
several SAR related genes were either not induced or delayed
in induction in systemic leaves (Figure 2D, Table 2). We sug-
gest that these genes are in part under the control of SA and
Ca2+/CaM which can regulate transcription by either directly or
indirectly interacting with transcription factors (review Dong,
2004; Kim et al., 2009; Reddy et al., 2011). The DNA-binding
activity of the transcription factor CAMTA (or SR) is enhanced
by Ca2+/CaM binding (review, Finkler et al., 2007). Arabidopsis
CAMTA3 acts as a negative regulator of biotic stress responses.
The loss-of-function mutants have elevated levels of SA and
exhibit enhanced disease resistance. Additionally, several defense-
associated genes (including PR genes) are found to be up-
regulated in camta3 mutants (Galon et al., 2008; Du et al.,
2009).
The cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) mutant cngc2
also shows constitutively high PR-1 gene expression and high
SA production (Chan et al., 2008). The phenotypes of both the
camta3 and cngc2 mutants are opposite to what we observed in
the InsP 5-ptase plants, which have low PR-1 gene expression
and low SA levels. We have noted a striking inverse correla-
tion between genes that are basally down regulated in the InsP
5-ptase plants and genes that are upregulated in camta3 and
cngc2 (Supplementary Table 4). Twelve of the basally upregulated
genes in cngc2, and thirteen of the upregulated genes in camta3
were found downregulated in InsP 5-ptase plants (Perera et al.,
2008) including PR-1, PR-2, and PR-5 (Supplementary Table 4).
Furthermore, there was strong overlap between this subset of
genes and the top 50 candidates in the PR-1 coexpression network
as well as with genes that upregulated in wild type seedlings grown
under high Ca2+ conditions (Chan et al., 2008). These results are
further support for Ca2+ mediated regulation of gene expression
although at present, the exact mechanism of activation of these
over lapping genes is not known.
SA is also implicated in the regulation of PR gene expression
via the activation of the TGA (TGACG Motif-Binding Factor)
transcription factors (review, Dong, 2004; Fu and Dong, 2013).
Accumulation of SA affects the cellular redox and controls the
translocation of the cofactor NPR1 into the nucleus where it
binds and activates TGAs. Most TGAs act as positive regulators
to induce PR genes as well as the expression of genes encoding
ER resident proteins involved in protein folding and Ca2+ stor-
age. The induction of the protein secretory pathway is required
for SAR (Wang et al., 2005). InsP 5-ptase plants have low basal
levels of PR-1, PR-5, CRT3, and BiP3 (Table 1), which may be in
part due to low basal SA and/or low ER Ca2+.
In conclusion, we show that the constitutive expression of InsP
5-ptase affects Ca2+ release, expression of a subset of defense
related genes and both basal and SAR responses but does not
affect ROS production. We favor the model postulated by Ranf
et al. (2011) in which Ca2+ acts as an “on/off switch” and a thresh-
old level of Ca2+ is required for full activation of the downstream
pathways. The InsP 5-ptase plants are impaired in their ability to
propagate and maintain the Ca2+ signal and therefore are unable
to mount a full and robust defense response.
