Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a signiﬁcant health risk
for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed
an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics
and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the
impact of spaceﬂight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative
analysis between ground control and spaceﬂight-exposed animals revealed
signiﬁcant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis,
synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex,
hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we
observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the path-
way level, some spaceﬂight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities
with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein
misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping
stone towards understanding spaceﬂight-induced CNS impairments at the
level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for com-
parison in future spaceﬂight studies. For broader scientiﬁc impact, all datasets
from this study are available through an interactive data portal, as well as the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Open Science Data
Repository (OSDR).
In preparation for long-duration lunar and Mars missions, it is crucial
to investigate the health risks to astronauts that are posed by exposure
to the space environment1. The key physiological impairments
include DNA damage and oxidative stress from galactic cosmic
radiation2, bone and muscle damage from loss of gravity3,4, circadian
and sleep dysregulation5, microbial dysbiosis6 and tissue and organ
degeneration, including cardiovascular and CNS damage7. Studies

neurodegeneration and neuroinﬂammation in vivo and in tissue and
cell models12, as well as cognitive and behavioral deﬁcits in rodent
models. Furthermore, major physiological effects of microgravity in
low-Earth orbit, as observed at the International Space Station (ISS),
include a redistribution of body ﬂuids from lower towards upper body
parts, leading to signiﬁcant cardiovascular13 and CNS changes14. How-
ever, deeper investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms
and speciﬁcity of these impairments, and identify targets for coun-
termeasure development.
Studies performed directly on astronauts have to be minimally
invasive, resulting in limited information on molecular and cellular
level outcomes, while spaceﬂown rodent models allow the range of
subcellular to behavioral-level investigation of spaceﬂight effects. In
this study, we used spatial transcriptomics and multiomics to explore
spaceﬂight-induced molecular changes in brain tissue of young adult
female BALB/c mice samples obtained during the Rodent Research-3
(RR-3) mission and requested from the NASA Biological Institutional
Scientiﬁc Collection (NBISC). We combined single-nucleus multiomics
(i.e., snMultiomics, RNA and ATAC sequencing) with Spatial Tran-
scriptomics (ST) data to study changes in chromatin accessibility and
RNA expression in different cell types and brain regions and to identify
key regional and cell type differences in responses to spaceﬂight.
Single-cell sequencing is a powerful method to obtain information
about the cellular composition of a tissue and cellular-level responses
to perturbations. However, the applicability of single-cell tran-
scriptomics relies on the accessibility of fresh specimens and the
possibility to successfully dissociate the tissue of interest15. Since
sample preparation in spaceﬂight studies typically involves in-orbit
freezing of the entire carcass to simplify the experiment and minimize
crew time, single-nucleus transcriptomics becomes a more feasible
method. Using single-nuclei multiomics, we were able to assess both
transcriptional proﬁles and chromatin changes within the same nuclei,
thus providing paired data of RNA expression and chromatin
accessibility.
While single-nuclei sequencing methods facilitate the study
of individual nuclei transcriptomes, they lack spatial context. There-
fore, spatial transcriptomics is a powerful addition, enabling the
comparison of effects among brain structures and providing tran-
scriptomics information coupled with the original location within tis-
sue sections16.
Overall, our study is a stepping stone towards the understanding
of the molecular changes induced by the space environment at the
resolution of individual cell type and brain region. Our ﬁndings not
only advance the knowledge of the neurological effects of spaceﬂight,
but also provide a critical foundation for future space biology mission
designs.
Results
To identify speciﬁc cellular microenvironments affected by space-
ﬂight, we combined the techniques of spatial transcriptomics (ST; 10X
Genomics Visium) and single-nucleus multiomics (snMultiomics; gene
expression and chromatin accessibility; 10× Genomics Single Cell
Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression) on mouse brain. In total, we ana-
lyzed three brains from mice euthanized on-board of the International
Space Station (ISS; F1, F2, F3) and three brains from ground control
mice (G1, G2, G3) that were kept under matched conditions (see Ani-
mals in Methods). For each sample, we isolated nuclei from one
hemisphere for snMultiomics analysis and cryo-sectioned the other
hemisphere for ST analysis with the focus on the hippocampal
region (Fig. 1).
Spaceﬂight sample quality is suitable for ST and snMultiomics
analysis
As a ﬁrst step, we ensured that the morphological and RNA quality of
the samples was suitable for our experimental workﬂow given that the
spaceﬂown samples had undergone a speciﬁc preservation approach17,
which was also used for the corresponding ground control animals
(see Animals in Methods). We measured the RNA integrity number
(RIN) for each sample and found that it was 9.15 on average (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we performed a tissue optimization
experiment conﬁrming that both RNA integrity and tissue morphology
was of sufﬁcient quality for ST analysis (see Visium Spatial Gene
Expression technology and sequencing in Methods; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1B).
snMultiomics dissects the effects of spaceﬂight on different cell
types in spaceﬂown mouse brains
To dissect the alterations induced by spaceﬂight at the single-nucleus
level, we performed a snMultiomics analysis on hemispheres of three
spaceﬂown (F1, F2, F3) mice and two out of three ground controls

(G2, G3), obtaining RNA expression proﬁles (RNA-seq) and chromatin
accessibility (ATAC-seq) information from the same nucleus.
In total, we isolated 21,178 nuclei across the spaceﬂight and con-
trol samples with an average of 3140 unique transcripts (Unique
Molecular Identiﬁer or UMI) per nucleus (i.e., from snRNA-seq) and
9217 peaks per nucleus (i.e., from snATAC-seq) (Fig. 2A, B; Supple-
mentary Fig. 1C) and an overall high gene expression correlation
between the spaceﬂight and ground control samples (r = 0.95,
p < 0.05; Fig. 2C). By integrating snRNASeq and snATAC-seq data and
performing a joint clustering analysis, we identiﬁed 18 snMultiomics
clusters (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. 2).
Next, we leveraged previously reported marker genes in the lit-
erature (see Gene and cluster annotation in Methods for details) to
identify 11 macro categories for the 18 snMultiomics clusters (inter-
changeably referred to as multiomics clusters in the next sections)
according to their functions (Fig. 2E; Supplementary Data 1, 2). The
majority of clusters were related to neurogenesis, neuronal activity
and synaptic transmission, distinguished by differences in neuro-
transmitters (GABAergic, glutamatergic, dopaminergic) and based on
gene expression patterns, tentatively associated with neuronal loca-
tions in hypothalamus, striatum, cortex and hippocampus.
We identiﬁed a total of 825 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
between spaceﬂown and ground control samples across all multiomics
clusters (Supplementary Data 3). The majority of these 825 DEGs were
involved in neuronal development (multiomics clusters 9, 11), axonal
or dendritic outgrowth (multiomics cluster 9), and synaptic trans-
mission (multiomics cluster 4), including speciﬁcally GABAergic
synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 11).
Comparison of 825 spaceﬂight multiomics DEGs to the 629 sig-
niﬁcant DEGs (Spaceﬂight vs Ground Control; p-value < 0.05) from the
bulk RNAseq data of the same mice brains from the same NASA
mission (RR-3), indicated 11 shared genes (p-value = 0.01582549,
hypergeometric distribution test; see Gene overlap test in Methods;
Supplementary Data 4). Out of these 11 overlapping genes, only 2
genes (Gabra6, and Kctd16) showed the same directional change in
both the datasets indicating that the majority of spaceﬂight effects are
cell type-speciﬁc and emphasizing the need for cell-speciﬁc analysis of
central nervous system responses to spaceﬂight.
We also compared these 825 spaceﬂight DEGs with spaceﬂight
DEGs reported in a total of 11 other datasets processed by NASA OSDR
including mass spectrometry and RNA-seq data collected from dif-
ferent organs of BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice strains. This comparison
revealed a total of 461 overlapping DEGs (p-value < 0.05) across all the
11 datasets combined (refer to Supplementary Data 5 for a detailed list
of overlapping genes and the resulting p-value from the hypergeo-
metric distribution test performed for each dataset).
ST provides a high-resolution mapping of gene expression
changes to mouse brain regions
To investigate spaceﬂight-induced CNS alterations at a spatial level, we
performed ST analysis on the other brain hemispheres from 3 ﬂight (F1,
F2, F3) and 3 ground control mice (G1, G2, G3). We collected two
coronal sections from each brain hemisphere containing hippo-
campus, somatosensory cortex, striatum, amygdala and corpus
callosum.
In total, we captured 14,630 genes across 29,770 spots after ﬁl-
tering and detected 10,884 UMIs/spot and 3755 genes/spot on average
(Fig. 2F, G; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) and found a high overall gene
expression correlation between spaceﬂight and ground control tissue
sections (r = 0.99, p < 0.05; Fig. 2H). Unsupervised clustering analysis
of spot information identiﬁed 18 distinct spatial clusters (further
referred as ST clusters) (Fig. 3A, B; Supplementary Data 6), which

presented a clear separation between the cortical top (ST cluster 1) and
bottom layers (ST cluster 9), as well as other major structures,
including hippocampus (with separation of CA1, CA3, and dentate
gyrus in ST clusters 10, 8 and 11 respectively), thalamus (ST cluster 5),
striatum (ST clusters 0, 14), hypothalamus (ST cluster 2), pituitary
(anterior and posterior; ST cluster 2), corpus callosum (ST cluster 12)
and cerebral peduncles (ST cluster 4) (Fig. 3C). Key functions of the
markers (Supplementary Data 7) that were shared by numerous ST
clusters include neurogenesis, neuronal development, axonal growth
and synaptogenesis, indicating that ST cluster analysis is dominated by
neuronal gene expression.
Next, we investigated how spaceﬂight inﬂuences gene expression
at the spatial level and identiﬁed a total of 4057 DEGs in 7 out of 18 ST
clusters (Supplementary Data 8). The majority of DEGs were involved
in neuronal development, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, and
neurodegeneration, including 21 DEGs in hippocampal CA3 neurons.
The most pronounced change in gene expression due to spaceﬂight
was observed in cortical neurons (bottom layers; ST cluster 9) which
showed 3208 DEGs (1808 upregulated, and 1400 downregulated) with
similar functions related to neuronal development and synaptic
transmission in somatosensory, motor and visual cortex. Consensus
pathway analysis18 highlighted neurodegeneration-associated path-
ways in cortical neurons (bottom layers; ST cluster 9) including protein
misfolding and abnormal protein clearance, indicating potential simi-
larities with neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein
misfolding and accumulation, such as Parkinson’s disease19,20 (Fig. 3D).
Integration of multiomics and ST datasets for spatial and cell
type-level effects of spaceﬂight
To infer the spatial distribution of the clusters identiﬁed by multio-
mics, we performed spot deconvolution analysis on matching ST
dataset using Stereoscope21 (which corrects for biases arising from
different experimental techniques before calculating celltype pro-
portions probabilities) (Fig. 3E; refer to Supplementary Figs. 4–6 for
detailed visualizations of multiomics cluster proportions in ST data-
set). The deconvolution analysis revealed similarities based on the
assigned functional annotations between several multiomics and
spatial data clusters, for instance, synaptic transmission (multiomics
cluster 1 matched with ST clusters 0 and 2), myelination (multiomics
cluster 3 matched ST clusters 4 and 12), and neuronal activity (mul-
tiomics cluster 15 matched ST cluster 5) (Fig. 3F; Supplementary Figs. 7,
8; Supplementary Data 9). This comparative analysis suggested the
effects of spaceﬂight on synaptic transmission speciﬁcally in cortex
(including both neurons and astrocytes, as revealed by snRNA-seq data
that allowed cell type separation) and on dopaminergic neuron
development speciﬁcally in striatum (Supplementary Data 9).
Ligand-receptor interaction analysis suggests spaceﬂight-
mediated effects on astrocyte functions
To assess the effects of spaceﬂight on the cell-cell interaction level, we
performed a ligand-receptor analysis on two multiomics clusters that
showed among highest number of differentially expressed genes in
response to spaceﬂight, i.e., multiomics clusters 4 (Astrocytes), and 11
(GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). We found 4 signiﬁcantly upregu-
lated interactions (Fig. 4A), including adhesion molecule pairs, EGFR
(epidermal growth factor receptor) pairs, and VEGFA (vascular endo-
thelial growth factor). These ligand-receptor interactions have pre-
viously been shown to be involved in cellular development in the CNS.
EGFR22, is involved in neuronal development, including axonal out-
growth.
Meanwhile,
VEGFA23,24
primarily regulates
angiogenesis
though it can also play a role in hippocampal neurogenesis, and
astrocyte-produced VEGFA has previously been demonstrated to reg-
ulate neuronalNMDA receptor activity23–25. Interestingly, we found that
spaceﬂight widely increased VEGFA_GRIN28 interactions between
multiomics
cluster
pairs
related
to
astrocytes
and
synaptic
transmission, i.e., 4-11 (Astrocytes-GABAergic Synaptic Transmission).
No ligand-receptor interactions in these clusters were signiﬁcantly
downregulated.
We also extended the ligand-receptor analysis to the ST dataset
using SpatialDM26. We applied SpatialDM on each ST brain section to
identify spatially co-expressed LR pairs and found a total of 1260 LR
pairs (Supplementary Fig. 9; refer to Supplementary Data 10 for a
detailed list of LR pairs with corresponding z-scores across each ST
section). Differential testing between the two conditions (ﬂight and
ground control) for the observed 1260 LR pairs revealed a total of 134
differential LR pairs (differential p-value < 0.1; Supplementary Data 11).
Motif analysis shows spaceﬂight effects on transcription factor
(TF) activity
To investigate the effects of spaceﬂight on transcription factors (TFs),
we performed motif analysis on snATAC-seq peaks from the single
nucleus multiomics data, which revealed spaceﬂight-mediated differ-
ences in TF activity in several multiomics clusters (Supplementary
Data 12), especially 4 (Astrocytes), and 11 (GABAergic Synaptic
Transmission).
Spaceﬂight was associated with reduced accessibility of motifs
Zic1, Zic2 and Atoh1 in multiomics clusters 4 (Astrocytes)27,28 (Fig. 4B).
Meanwhile, increased accessibility of motifs Pou5f1 and Sox2 in mul-
tiomics cluster 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission) might indicate
reduced neuronal differentiation in spaceﬂight29–31 (Fig. 4C). In addi-
tion to neuronal effects, motifs Pparg, Rxra and Nr2f6, which collec-
tively inhibit immune responses, showed decreased accessibility in
telencephalon
interneurons
(multiomics
cluster
11),
suggesting
increased inﬂammatory responses in space32–34, and possible circadian
dysregulation35–39.
Spatial gene expression patterns show several changes in sig-
naling pathways occurring in spaceﬂight brain samples
Local environments of cell types may affect the functional responses to
spaceﬂight represented by changes in signaling pathways. We com-
pared key signaling pathways in adjacent locations based on the
spatially-resolved cell type deconvolution results from Stereoscope
analyzed using the Multiview intercellular SpaTial modeling frame-
work (MISTy)40. This tool allowed us to investigate the relationships
between cell type proportions in each ST spot and activities of 14
pathways inferred by decoupler-py and PROGENy41,42. Speciﬁcally, the
MISTy models predict cell type abundance in a spot based on an
intraview (features in the same spot) and paraview (weighted sum of
the features in the neighboring spots; weights decreasing with dis-
tance). Either cell type abundances or pathway activities were selected
as “features” for the model, and a separate model was built for
each sample and cell type. To analyze the effects of spaceﬂight, the
models were subsequently aggregated into ﬂight and ground control
groups.
Based on cell type abundances, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
changes in cell type colocalization (which would occur during
tissue restructuring or lesion formation) between ﬂight and ground
controls, similar to our previous ﬁnding of no signiﬁcant changes
in cell type abundance in deconvolution results (Supplementary
Figs. 7 and 8).
In contrast, changes in signaling pathways were associated with
individual cell types. Cell abundance in neurovasculature (multiomics
cluster 12) colocalized with decreased MAPK signaling in spaceﬂight
(Fig. 4D). Similarly, signaling changes in local neighborhood (MISTy
paraview) of several other cell types were found in spaceﬂight samples
(Fig. 4E): (1) less negative correlation of EGFR signaling and glutama-
tergic neuronal cells; (2) more negative correlation of MAPK and
cholinergic, monoaminergic and peptidergic neurons; (3) increased
TGFbeta signaling in the vicinity of GABAergic interneurons; (4)
reduced WNT signaling in class II glutamatergic neurons.

To assess the downstream effects of these changes, we built a
tissue-speciﬁc gene regulatory network (GRN) from the multiomics
data using CellOracle43 and used it to predict TF activities in spatial
data and computed the Pearson correlation between TF and signaling
activities for the dysregulated pathways in spots containing the cell
types identiﬁed above. The network suggested that the decrease in
MAPK signaling in spaceﬂight increases activity of the transcription
factor Glis3 and reduces Lef1 in neurovasculature, respectively
(Fig. 4F, G).
Metabolic gene enrichment analysis shows decreased gene
expression in spaceﬂight mice
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on the ST data using metabolic
pathways indicated spaceﬂight-mediated inhibition of the oxidative
phosphorylation pathway, especially Complex I signaling (Fig. 5A,
Supplementary Data 13), as well as pathways related to glycolysis/
gluconeogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 10), fructose and mannose
metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 11) and arachidonic acid metabolism
(Fig. 5B). Analysis of multiomics data was consistent with spaceﬂight-

mediated reduction in these pathways together with fatty acid synth-
esis (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Data 14). Deﬁcits in glycolysis and oxi-
dative phosphorylation are consistent with previously reported
mitochondrial impairments caused by spaceﬂight44, while, arachidonic
acid is primarily produced by astrocytes and suggests astrocyte dys-
function as a potential target for future spaceﬂight CNS studies.
Validation of differential gene expression
In order to validate our ﬁndings on the spaceﬂight affected processes
in mouse brain, we performed single molecule Fluorescence In situ
Hybridization (smFISH) using the RNAscope technology for two genes
of interest (Adcy1 and Gpc5) in ﬁve brain sections: 3 ﬂights, 2 ground
controls (Supplementary Fig. 12) from a comparative set of mice (see
Methods). We observed signiﬁcant upregulation in the expression of
both genes in spaceﬂight samples, conﬁrming our ﬁndings from the ST
data and multiomics data analysis (Supplementary Data 3 and 8, Sup-
plementary Fig. 13A–C). Adcy1 was particularly upregulated in the
hippocampus and associated with changes in neuronal activity (ST
clusters 8, 11), while Gpc5 was upregulated in astrocytes (multiomics
cluster 4).
Discussion
In this study, we used brain samples from ground control and space-
ﬂown female mice from the RR-3 mission to understand the effects of
the space environment at high resolution: at the level of individual
brain cell types and brain regions. The main alterations in gene
expression induced by spaceﬂight included changes in synaptogenesis
and neuronal development, as well as neurodegeneration and inﬂam-
mation, similar to previously reported tissue and behavioral-level
effects of simulated spaceﬂight and simulated deep space radiation in
mice12. In addition, multiple gene expression changes mapped to
pathways associated with circadian rhythm and mitochondrial func-
tions. This study applies spatial transcriptomics and single-cell mul-
tiomics to study the effects of spaceﬂight on the CNS which can serve
as a stepping stone towards comparative investigation of samples
from other space missions and the outcomes of live animal return and
reacclimation to Earth conditions.
We demonstrate spatial transcriptomics and single nuclei mul-
tiomics datasets to be highly complementary. For example, single-
nucleus resolution permitted a focus on glial cells including astrocytes
and microglia, which were not distinguishable in neuron-dominated ST
datasets, due to the lower resolution of the method. Similarly, our
snATAC-seq analysis in transcription factor binding sites indicated
immune dysfunction34, while immune cells were too few to be distin-
guishable in ST. On the other hand, combining spatial and gene
expression data revealed region-speciﬁc effects of spaceﬂight32,45.
Furthermore, analysis of ligand-receptor interactions revealed inter-
actions between different cell types, with the focus on neurodeve-
lopment and astrocyte functions.
In our study, multiple lines of evidence converged on spaceﬂight-
mediated disruption of neurogenesis, neuronal development and
synaptogenesis, including dopaminergic synapse formation in the
striatum. Similar outcomes of increased pluripotency and reduced cell
differentiation have previously been reported in spaceﬂown mouse
bone samples46, in spaceﬂown human stem cell models47, and in irra-
diated mouse models48, indicating that it might be a systemic impair-
ment that has now been identiﬁed to include the CNS. In addition,
neurogenesis has been shown to be affected in a spaceﬂight analog
study that combined simulated microgravity and low dose rate photon
irradiation in mice10. Notably, synaptogenesis is particularly sensitive
to simulated galactic cosmic radiation components49, indicating a
potential additional risk for deep space missions. Finally, our obser-
vations in the striatal gene expression changes and transcription factor
accessibility are worth validating in future spaceﬂight experiments,
since they might result in disrupted dopaminergic signaling.
Spaceﬂight-associated changes in circadian gene expression are
consistent with circadian disruption as one of the major biological
responses to spaceﬂight50, though it has been studied comparatively
little so far, especially in animal models51. Molecular and cellular CNS
correlation of circadian gene expression dysregulation in spaceﬂight
remains to be investigated in greater detail.
Our results suggest potential similarities between spaceﬂight and
some terrestrial CNS conditions. Changes in gene expression asso-
ciated with disrupted synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, oxidative
stress and inﬂammation collectively resemble neurodegeneration that
is associated with natural aging. Thus, in future studies anti-aging and
neuroprotective therapeutics, such as antioxidants52 or mitochondria-
targeting pharmaceuticals53,54, might be repurposed as spaceﬂight
countermeasures, or vice versa, spaceﬂight might be used as a model
for accelerated aging55. We have recently begun computational studies
on identifying terrestrial disorder analogs to alterations induced by
spaceﬂight, though they have not yet included CNS effects, which will
require comparing the data from multiple spaceﬂight experiments56.
Our study presents two main limitations. The ﬁrst one is related to
statistical robustness. Speciﬁcally, since the input material consists of
spaceﬂight legacy samples collected without envisioning a spatial

ways affected by spaceﬂight. A Dotplot showing the differentially expressed
ligand receptor pairs found by CellPhoneDB between two interacting multiomics
clusters (4 and 11) which are affected by spaceﬂight. These clusters showed the
largest number of spaceﬂight DEGs, and four LR pairs were found signiﬁcantly
upregulated in these interactions. The null distribution of the mean expression of
the LR pairs was estimated by employing a random permutation approach. The
mean expression of the interacting LR molecule pairs are indicated by the dot
colors and the dot sizes represent the p-values which refers to the enrichment of
the LR pair in the interacting multiomics clusters. Scales for both dot size and color
are presented below the plot. B Accessibility differences for motifs Atoh1, Zic1, and

transcriptomics analysis, the resulting brain morphology is not fully
even across samples. This limits the interpretability of the differences
between spaceﬂight and ground control conditions to only a subset of
spatial and multiomics clusters. Therefore, it will be important to
validate the results of the RR-3 mission by comparing them to the
neuronal effects of spaceﬂight in other mouse studies at similarly high
resolution to increase statistical robustness. Moreover, it will be
meaningful to expand the experimental design by including samples
from animals that underwent a period of reacclimation to ground
conditions after spaceﬂight. By doing so, it will be possible to quantify
the extent to which spaceﬂight-mediated impairments persist after
landing, especially once model organisms begin to age. This will allow
the investigation of key aspects of astronaut health risks that have not
been included yet.
The second limitation of our study relates to the sex of the ana-
lyzed animals. The majority of mouse studies in spaceﬂight have been
performed on females to facilitate group housing, while astronaut
cohorts include both male and female astronauts. Thus, it will be
necessary to compare male and female animals to address the sexual
dimorphism of CNS health risks. In order to further extrapolate animal
models to human outcomes, human and mouse CNS organ model
systems will have to be ﬂown as payloads. The ﬁrst human neurovas-
cular models have already been investigated on the ISS57,58, though
their results have not yet been published, while analyzing the effects of
simulated space radiation on human neurovascular models59 high-
lighted the importance of investigating astrocyte functions in missions
beyond low-Earth orbit. In preparation for these missions, in which
crew time will be severely limited, it will be essential to develop
automated, long-lasting CNS models and compare their responses to
model organisms.
Overall, our study serves as a preliminary indication to the
potential risks that the brain is exposed to in spaceﬂight missions and
more studies with larger sample sizes will be required to conﬁrm our
ﬁndings. To encourage the scientiﬁc community to use our datasets
for generating new discoveries, all our data is openly available through
NASA GeneLab and can be explored by a Shiny app (https://
giacomellolabst.shinyapps.io/rr3-brain-shiny/).
In summary, in this study, we observed that spaceﬂight altered the
expression of genes associated with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and
neuronal development in multiple regions of the brain, especially
striatum, as well as oxidative stress and neuroinﬂammation collectively
resembling neurological aging and neurodegeneration. Future studies
are planned to increase statistical robustness, focus on neuroimmune
outcomes and investigate the persistence of spaceﬂight effects after
landing and re-acclimation to Earth environment. In addition, our
ﬁndings illustrate the beneﬁts of combined spatial transcriptomics and
single-cell analysis in revealing detailed biological alterations and
suggest them as highly relevant techniques for future space biology
research. Our shared data, freely available in NASA’s OSDR database60,
aims to deepen our collective understanding of the impact of space-
ﬂight on biological systems.
Methods
Ethical approval
The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (CAS-15-001-Y1) was
approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee (IACUC) for both ﬂight (housed at the NASA Ames Research
Center)
and
ground
control
(housed
at
the
Kennedy
Space
Center) mice.
Animals
A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were ﬂown to the ISS and
housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39–42 days. Male mice were not used
in this study because of their behavioral impairments when co-housed
in a stressful environment. Recent studies have also shown that the ISS
differences across individual male mice are greater than those across
female mice61, indicating negligible effects of any hormonal changes
during estrus cycle in female mice. Mice of similar age, sex and strain
were used as ground controls housed in identical hardware (Rodent
Habitat AEM-X, identiﬁer 1379) and matching ISS environmental
conditions62, including but not limited to cage type, light cycle (stan-
dard 12:12 light/dark cycle for both ground control and ﬂight mice
groups), food (Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)), tem-
perature (23.36 °C, and 21.37 °C on average for ground control and
ﬂight mice, respectively), humidity (41.86% and 41.53% on average
for ground control and ﬂight mice, respectively) and CO2 concentra-
tion (3664.89 ppm mean CO2 for ground controls, and 3711.97 ppm
mean CO2 for ﬂight mice). Detailed information on environmental
telemetry data including temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and cabin
radiation exposure can be found on NASA’s Environmental Data
Application (EDA) by clicking on the publicly accessible link https://
visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/eda/ and selecting ‘RR-3’ from the drop-
down menu in the Mission Dashboard on the right-hand panel. Addi-
tionally, all information on RR-3 mission payload is publicly available
on NASA OSDR link https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/payloads/
RR-3.
At the end of the mission, spaceﬂight and ground controls were
euthanized (using euthanasia chemical ketamine/xylazine/aceproma-
zine) and whole carcasses were stored at −80 °C until the dissection on
earth. Mouse carcasses were removed from −80 °C storage and thawed
at room temperature for 15–20 min for dissection. Each carcass dis-
section time was no longer than 1 h from collection of the ﬁrst tissue.
Brain tissues were harvested and placed into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes for
snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, then stored in −80 °C freezer for
sample processing.
RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from tissue sections using the RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen). RNA integrity was measured by using the Agilent Bioanaly-
zer. All samples had RIN values above 8.
Sample preparation
Six brains in total, three from each group, were used in this study.
Hemispheres of each of the brain samples were split. One hemisphere
from each sample was embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. and cryo-
sectioned in the hippocampus area at 10 µm thickness. Sections were
placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays, Superfrost glass slides or
into Eppendorf tubes. Second hemisphere of each brain was used for
nuclei isolation. Samples were stored in −80 °C before processing.
Visium Spatial Gene Expression technology and sequencing
First, 10× Genomics Spatial Gene Expression Tissue Optimization
protocol was performed on 8 consecutive mouse brain sections to
determine the optimal permeabilization time. One tissue section
was used as a negative control. The experiment was performed
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
instructions
(User
Guide,
CG000283 Rev B).
Spatial gene expression libraries were generated using the Visium
Gene Expression kit (10x Genomics). Brain hemispheres were cryo-
sectioned to reach the hippocampus area. Two consecutive sections of
hippocampus from the ground control cohort and two consecutive
sections of hippocampus from the ﬂight cohort were placed on Visium
glass slides. Consecutive sections were considered technical repli-
cates. In total, 12 Visium libraries were prepared following the manu-
facturer’s protocol (User Guide, CG000239 Rev F). Twelve libraries
were sequenced by using an Illumina Novaseq platform, while four
were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform and sequenced
by using a Illumina Novaseq platform. Length of read 1 was 28 bp and
read 2 was 120 bp long.

Chromium single-cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression tech-
nology and sequencing
Nuclei isolation. One hemisphere of 4 brains used for Spatial Tran-
scriptomics was utilized for nuclei isolation. Brain tissue was placed
into a tube together with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 nM NaCl,
3 nM MgCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM DTT, 1U/µl RNAseOUT),
homogenized by pestle homogenization in eppendorf tube and incu-
bated on ice for 5 min. The nuclei were extracted by following
10XGenomic protocol for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expres-
sion Sequencing (User Guide, CG000375 Rev B). Each sample was ﬁl-
tered through a 40 µm cell strainer prior to FACS sorting. Sorted and
permeabilized nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, coun-
ted and used for Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene
Expression library preparation. One hemisphere from the ground
control G1 sample was used to optimize the nuclei isolation protocol.
Cell sorting. The stained cell nuclei suspension samples were then
analyzed and sorted utilizing a BD Bioscience Inﬂux ﬂow cytometer
using an 86 μm nozzle. Flow cytometry analyses and sorting were
carried out by the following gating strategy: nuclei:singlets:7-AAD
positive events. The nuclei sub-population was characterized in the
Side Scatter-Forward Scatter plot by back-gating from the 7-AAD (ex.
488 nm, em. 692 nm), singlets were gated in the Side Scatter – Pulse
width plot and ﬁnally the nuclei were gated in the Side Scatter – 7-AAD
plot. The nuclei were collected in a BSA coated Eppendorf tube.
Single nuclei samples. Isolated and sorted nuclei were used to gen-
erate single nuclei gene expression and ATAC-seq libraries according
to the manufacturer’s protocol using Chromium Single Cell Multiome
ATAC + Gene Expression kit (User Guide, CG000338 Rev E). Finished
Gene Expression libraries were sequenced by using an Illumina Next-
Seq2000 platform with lengths of read 1 and read 2, 28 bp and 120 bp
long respectively. Finished ATAC-seq libraries were sequenced by
using an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform. Length of both read 1 and
read 2 was 50 bp long.

ST data generation. Sequenced Visium libraries were processed using
Space Ranger software (version 1.0.0, 10X Genomics). Reads were
aligned to the Space Ranger built-in mouse reference genome (mm10-
3.0.0) and count matrices were generated using these along with the
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images.
ST data analysis
ST data analysis was performed jointly in R (v4.1.1) using the Seurat
package (v4.0.1) and STUtility (v0.1.0). InputFromTable() was used to
generate a Seurat object from the count matrices with speciﬁc ﬁltering
parameters
(min.spot.feature.count = 100,
min.gene.count = 100,
min.gene.spots = 10, and min.spot.count = 100). The count matrices
were enriched for protein-coding and lincRNA genes and then ﬁltered
for MALAT1, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes. Next, all spots con-
taining less than 200 genes were removed. Technical variability within
data was reduced with SCTransform (SCTransform() with default set-
tings;
SelectIntegrationFeatures()
with
nfeatures = 3000;
Pre-
pSCTIntegration() with anchor.features assigned to genes returned
from the SelectIntegrationFeatures()) and Harmony (RunHarmony()
with group.vars = ‘section.name’ addressing for batches associated
with different Visium slide capture areas) packages. Principal Com-
ponent Analysis (PCA) was used for selection of signiﬁcant compo-
nents (RunPCA() with default 50PCs computed; 35 selected for the rest
of the analysis). FindClusters() with resolution = 0.35 and dims = 1:35
was used to identify ST clusters and then Uniform Manifold Approx-
imation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the same in
2D space.
Multiomics data generation
The sequenced multiomics (snRNA-seq, and snATAC-seq) libraries
were processed using CellRanger ARC (v2) software from 10X Geno-
mics with default settings. Reads were mapped to the mouse genome
(mm10 reference 2020-A from 10X Genomics).
Multiomics data analysis
Data analysis for the snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data was performed
in R (v4.1.1) using the packages Seurat (v4.1.0) and Signac (v1.6.0). In
total, extracted single nuclei from 5 brain hemispheres were pro-
cessed, resulting in 21,178 nuclei used in the analysis. The chromatin
assay was generated using CreateChromatinAssay() from the Signac
package (min.cells = 10). The annotation data for this was obtained
using GetGRangesFromEnsDb() (ensdb=EnsDb.Mmusculus.v79). The
snRNA-seq assay was generated using Read10X_h5() available in the
Seurat package. MALAT1, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes were
removed and count matrix was further ﬁltered on number of reads,
genes and peaks, as well as fraction ATAC-seq reads in peaks, and
enrichment of ATAC-seq reads at transcription start sites. Filtering for
low quality nuclei and genes was applied separately for each sample
using a custom function, code for which can be found on our GitHub
repository63 (see Code availability for more details). Doublet ﬁnder was
used for doublet removal (v2.0.3) with a doublet score cut-off of 0.6.
RNA-seq data was normalized using SCTransform with V2 regulariza-
tion, while also regressing out cell cycle effects using cell cycle genes
list available in the Seurat package. ATAC-seq data was normalized
using TF-IDF normalization with default settings. Harmony (group.-
by.vars=‘bio_origin’) was then used to remove batch effects and inte-
grate data from different samples, after which cells from both RNA-seq
and ATAC-seq data were clustered using Weighted Nearest Neighbor
(WNN) Analysis (FindMultiModalNeighbors() function with para-
meters reduction.list=list(‘SCT_CC_harmony’, ‘ATAC_harmony’); dim-
s.list=list(1:30, 2:30); k.nn=30). Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the multiomics clusters
(FindClusters() with setting Resolution=0.2).
Differential expression analysis
For identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes between clusters,
Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, implemented in the Seurat function Fin-
dAllMarkers() was used. Only genes expressed in at least 25% of cells
were included in the analysis, and genes with log2 fold change >0.25
and FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially
expressed.
Differential gene expression between ﬂight and ground condi-
tions was performed using MAST, with a mixed model, using sample as
a random effect. The analysis was done on each cell type separately,
and included genes expressed in at least 30% of ﬂight or ground cells in
the given cell type. Genes with FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 were
considered differentially expressed. Differential chromatin accessi-
bility between ﬂight and ground conditions was performed the same
way, using the same parameters.
Gene overlap test
To test the signiﬁcance of the overlapping genes found from the
validation analysis, a hypergeometric distribution test was used to test
the null hypothesis: The overlap of X genes between the two genelists
is a random sampling effect. The phyper() function in R (v4.3.2) was
used to perform the hypergeometric distribution test and the resultant
p-value was recorded. The R scripts consisting of the code for this test
is available on our github repository63 (refer to Code availability for
details).
Motif analysis
ChromVAR (v1.16.0)64, with default settings, was used to assess chro-
matin accessibility around DNA sequence motifs, taken from the
Article

JASPAR (v2020_0.99.10) database65. For each motif and cell chromVAR
calculated a score representing chromatin accessibility, while cor-
recting for confounders such as for GC content and average accessi-
bility. The chromatin accessibility scores from ﬂight and ground cells
were then compared, for each cell type separately. This was done with
a mixed model using, sample as a random effect, implemented in the
lmer() function from the lme4 (v1.1-28.9000) package. Motifs with FDR
adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially accessible
between ﬂight and ground conditions.
Gene and cluster annotation
Marker genes from the clustering analysis and the DEGs from the dif-
ferential expression, for both ST and multiomics data, were using
marker genes in the Tabula muris database66, literature search and
EnrichR pathway analysis tool (with mouse model organism used as
background)67–69. These annotations for the marker genes were used as
a guide for manual annotation of the multiomics as well as the ST
clusters.
Pathway analysis
For pathway analysis and visualization of the results, the Consensus
Pathway Analysis platform18 and the EnrichR pathway analysis tool67–69
were used. For both these tools, pathway enrichment was determined
relative to a universal background rather than a custom-deﬁned, brain-
speciﬁc gene list. This is to accept a known bias towards over-
representation of brain-speciﬁc pathways in place of potential
unknown biases resulting from the construction of a custom back-
ground gene list.
Ligand-receptor analysis
Ligand-receptor interactions analysis was performed with the package
CellPhoneDB (v3)70. Multiomics clusters were analyzed using the DE
genes for spaceﬂight obtained from using MAST (v1.20.0) (see Dif-
ferential Expression Analysis in Methods). For the analysis, DE genes
were transformed to their human orthologues which is a required
criteria to run CellPhoneDB.
The ligand-receptor analysis on the spatial data to identify co-
expressed LR pairs was performed using SpatialDM (v0.1.0)26. The
standard pipeline to perform global selection of signiﬁcant LR pairs
and for local selection of spots for co-expressed LR pairs was per-
formed using the package documentation as a reference (with l = 250
and cutoff = 0.2 in sdm.weight_matrix() function). Likelihood ratio test
was used in the differential testing and the test was run by following
the package documentation. For further details on the scripts used in
this analysis, refer to the Code availability section.
Spatial pattern analysis
We inferred a gene regulatory network (GRN) from the brain multio-
mics dataset using CellOracle43. A tissue-speciﬁc GRN was generated by
grouping all brain cell types into the same label before running the
method. Transcription Factor (TF) activities were inferred for the brain
spatial transcriptomics data using decoupler-py41 with the method
mlm and the obtained GRN as prior knowledge. Additionally, pathway
activities were inferred for the brain spatial transcriptomics data using
decoupler-py with the method mlm and the PROGENy model of
pathway footprints as prior knowledge42.
To analyze spatial relationships between cell types and pathway
activities, we built cell type speciﬁc models with MISTy40, which pre-
dict abundances (as determined by Stereoscope) from pathway
activities in situ and from the local neighborhood (up to two spots
away). In this case, The MISTy models are built only on Visium spots
with at least 5% of the speciﬁc cell type.
We then extracted cell type-pathway interactions that occur in
only one of the conditions. In the regions of interest where these dif-
ferential interactions occur, we investigate changes in correlation
(Pearson) between pathway activities and TF activities inferred from
the
CellOracle
GRNs.
We
used
Student’s
t-tests
with
Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction for both determining
the differential interactions and the changes in correlation.
Metabolic pathway analysis
The ﬂight-vs-ground expression level fold changes of each cluster were
computed for genes that are expressed in more than 1% of the cells in
either ﬂight or ground condition of the cluster, using the FindMar-
kers() function in the Seurat package (v4.1.1)71. Genes listed in the
RECON3D metabolic model72 were extracted with their assigned
metabolic pathway membership. The human gene IDs were translated
to mouse gene IDs using the manual inspection and the HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) Comparison of Orthology Predic-
tions (HCOP) service73. All genes from the ﬂight-vs-ground expression
analysis were then ranked by fold-change differences (positive to
negative) regardless of the p-value from FindMarkers() function, and
tested for pathway enrichment vs the genes in RECON3D pathways
using the fgsea function in the fgsea package (v1.22.0)74 in R (v4.2.1)75.
Resulting p-value enrichment of RECON3D-sourced pathways were
adjusted (adjusted p-value) by program for the number of pathway
tests performed.
ShinyApp
ShinyApp was designed using the package shiny (v1.7.1) in R (v4.1.1)
and the theme superhero was used for the overall esthetics of the
shinyapp design. The R (v4.3.2) package babelgene (v22.9) with
references from the NCBI database was used to identify the human
orthologs for the genes listed under the Cluster markers - Expression
and Spaceﬂight DEGs - Expression tabs in the shinyapp. All genes from
Supplementary Data 4, 7 and 8 can be visualized on the shinyapp.
RNAscope
Single molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) to detect
expression of genes of interest (Adcyl and Gpc55) was performed using
the RNAscope technology following the manufacturer’s protocol
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics, ACD, Hayward, CA). Target genes (Gpc5 in
channel red, Adcy1 in channel green) were visualized using the HRP-
based RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Assay V2 (Cat. No. 323110).
Brains from a cohort of 14–15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J wild type
mice ﬂown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 28-29 days
(NASA RR-10 mission) were used for this validation. Brains from mice
of similar age, sex and strain were used as ground controls housed in
identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. At the
end of the mission, spaceﬂight and ground controls were euthanized
(euthanasia method: bilateral thoracotomy with sedation, ketamine/
xylazine injection) and whole carcasses were stored at −80 °C until the
dissection on earth. Brain tissues were harvested and snapped frozen
in liquid nitrogen, then stored in −80 °C freezer for sample processing.
Brains from two ground controls (GC3, GC9) and three ﬂights
(FL1, FL3 and FL5) were cryo-sectioned to reach the hippocampus area
and for each of them, one 10 µm section was placed on a superfrost
plus slide and stored at −80 °C for less than a week before proceeding
to the RNAscope protocol. The tissue sections were subjected to
permeabilization steps before incubation with the target probes. The
signal was ampliﬁed using the HRP-based technology (visualized by
Tyramide Signal Ampliﬁcation or TSATM ﬂuorophores by PerkinElmer).
RNAscope signal quantiﬁcation
The quantiﬁcation of the ﬂuorescence signal was performed with Fiji
by ImageJ software. The images were taken with a ZEN LSM700 con-
focal microscope and exported as tiff with the same settings. Once
exported they were loaded on ImageJ and the whole area of the sec-
tion, i.e., the whole hemisphere was selected for quantiﬁcation. Image
was then transformed from RGB to 16-bit and quantiﬁcation was done

by counting the number of pixels positive for the threshold set. The
threshold was unique for each channel and was kept the same for
ground and control samples.
