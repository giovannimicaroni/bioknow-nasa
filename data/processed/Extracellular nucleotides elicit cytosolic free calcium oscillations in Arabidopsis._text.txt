xtracellular purine nucleotides appear 
capable of regulating plant devel-
opment, defense and stress responses 
by acting in part as agonists of plasma 
membrane calcium channels. Factors 
stimulating ATP release include wound-
ing, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we 
show that exogenous abscisic acid and 
l-glutamate can also cause ATP accumu-
lation around Arabidopsis thaliana roots. 
Release of ADP from root epidermis 
would trigger ionotropic receptor-like 
activity in the plasma membrane, result-
ing in transient elevation of cytosolic 
free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts 
(expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free 
calcium reporter) can support an extracel-
lular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium ele-
vation in the presence of an extracellular 
reductant. This confirms that ADP could 
elicit calcium-based responses distinct to 
those of ATP, which have been shown pre-
viously to involve production of extracel-
lular reactive oxygen species.
Extracellular purine nucleotides can regu-
late plant cell growth, stress responses, 
immunity and symbiotic events.1,2 Their 
activity at the plasma membrane elic-
its increased production of nitric oxide 
(NO), activation of NADPH oxidases to 
produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
and transient elevations of cytosolic free 
calcium ([Ca2+]cyt).3-9 Although there 
are no equivalents to animal ionotropic 
or metabotropic purinoreceptor genes 
apparent in higher plant genomes, plant 
responses to extracellular purine nucleo-
tides are sensitive to antagonists of animal 
purinoceptors.1,10-12 Arabidopsis thaliana 
plasma membrane Ca2+ channel activity 
was recently found to be activated rapidly

by extracellular ADP, consistent with 
the presence of an ionotropic receptor.13 
Parallels with animal cells also extend to 
a conserved mechanism of ATP and ADP 
hydrolysis by extracellular apyrase,14 plus 
release of ATP by exocytosis15 and an ABC 
transporter.16
ATP is released at plant wound and 
growth points, in response to touch, elici-
tors and hyperosmotic stress imposed by 
salts.1,17,18 Here, wounding, hyperosmotic 
or sodicity stress resulted in distinct lev-
els and time courses of ATP accumula-
tion around excised roots of A. thaliana 
(Fig. 1). Recovery of ATP levels to con-
trol values was evident at the 30 min 
time point after wounding but remained 
significantly elevated in response to abi-
otic stresses (30 min time point; NaCl, 
p < 0.001; sorbitol, p < 0.036, Student’s 
t-test). The stress response hormone 
abscisic acid (ABA) at 1 and 10 μM also 
promoted ATP accumulation around 
excised roots (Fig. 2A), albeit to a lower 
level. Accumulation above the ethanol 
control was significant for both concen-
trations at 10 and 15 min. Application 
of 10 μM ABA inhibits A. thaliana pri-
mary root growth, a response involving a 
plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and 
plasma membrane proline-rich extensin-
like receptor kinase (PERK4).19,20 PERK4 
directs the activation of plasma membrane 
Ca2+ influx channels.20 As extracellu-
lar ATP activates root epidermal plasma 
membrane Ca2+ influx channels via acti-
vation of an NADPH oxidase, it becomes 
feasible that ABA inhibition involves ATP 
release and sensing upstream of NADPH 
oxidases and PERKs, resulting in an 
inhibitory Ca2+ influx. High [Ca2+]cyt can 
act as a “brake” to root hair elongation

and perhaps this may also hold for elon-
gation of primary roots.21 Production of 
ROS by NADPH oxidases also promotes 
root cell elongation by activating plasma 
membrane Ca2+ channels.22 Thus, the 
dose-dependent stimulation or inhibition 
of growth by extracellular ATP may be 
effected by the levels of ROS production 
and channel activation.
Extracellular glutamate can also ele-
vate root [Ca2+]cyt by activating plasma 
membrane glutamate receptor-like (GLR) 
channels.23,24 As shown in Figure 2B, 
1 μM l-glutamate caused transient ATP 
accumulation but equimolar D-glutamate 
did not, indicating stereospecificity of the 
response. Exposure to 10 μM l-glutamate 
was less effective than 1 μM, suggest-
ing a biphasic response. At these con-
centrations, glutamate is unlikely to be 
transported into roots by the low affin-
ity amino acid permease AAP1 or by 
H+-coupled symport25,26 and so should be 
acting extracellularly. l-glutamate at 10 
μM and above inhibits A. thaliana pri-
mary root growth,27 and it will be interest-
ing to see how this relates, if at all, to ATP 
functions. Perception of extracellular glu-
tamate at the epidermis upstream of ATP 
release could be mediated by GLR2.1, 3.3, 
3.5 and 5 as the most highly expressed of 
the gene family in this cell file. Across the 
meristematic region GLR2.4, 3.3, 3.6,5 
are the most highly expressed while across 
the elongation zone, GLR 1.4, 2.1, 3.3, 3.5 
and 3.6 predominate.28
Once purine nucleotides are released 
from roots, they can activate plasma 
membrane 
Ca2+-permeable 
channels 
directly (ADP)13 or via production of 
extracellular ROS (ATP).11 Accordingly, 
ATP activation of root epidermal plasma 
membrane Ca2+-permeable channels can 
be prevented by applying dithiothrei-
tol (DTT) as a reductant.11 Here, ADP-
induced [Ca2+]cyt elevation of A. thaliana 
root epidermal protoplasts (measured 
as in ref. 13) was unaffected by incuba-
tion in DTT (1 mM) (0.1 mM ADP; 
0.45 ± 0.04 μM [Ca2+]cyt, n = 6: ADP + 
DTT; 0.52 ± 0.03 μM [Ca2+]cyt, n = 9), 
confirming that extracellular ROS are not 
involved in ADP activation of Ca2+ influx.
Addition of purine nucleotides to 
A. thaliana root epidermis causes transient 
changes in net Ca2+ and K+ fluxes down-
stream of the initial sensing event.13 ADP 
promotes net Ca2+ influx but ATP and 
the weakly hydrolysable analog adenosine 
5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate (αβATP) 
only promote influx when applied up to 
100 μM, above which Ca2+ efflux is pro-
moted.13 Under control conditions used in 
reference 13, there is a net K+ efflux from 
both elongation zone (-235 ± 16  nmol 
m-2  s-1; n = 33) and mature epidermis 
(-44 ± 3 nmol m-2 s-1; n = 25) detected by 
extracellular vibrating K+-selective micro-
electrodes. From the data presented in 
reference 13, this indicates that in the elon-
gation zone, ADP, ATP and αβATP up to 
approximately 10 μM would decrease net 
K+ efflux and promote Ca2+ influx. Above 
10 μM, K+ efflux would be promoted. At 
the mature epidermis ADP up to 10 μM 
and ATP/αβATP up to approximately 
100 μM would decrease K+ efflux while 
promoting Ca2+ influx. Above these lev-
els, K+ efflux would be promoted. At pres-
ent the contribution of underlying cells 
and the walls are unknown. If the origin 
were the epidermal plasma membrane, the 
results indicate involvement of K+ efflux 
pathways and it will be interesting to test 
whether the epidermal K+ efflux channel 
AtGORK is involved.29 How the cation 
fluxes are generated and what their con-
sequences are now need to be elucidated.

Figure 1. Wounding and abiotic stress cause ATP accumulation around A. thaliana roots. A. thaliana 
(Col-0) was grown for 7 d as described previously on MS medium with 1% (w/v) sucrose.13 Eight 
roots of similar lengths were placed in the well of a 96-well plate containing sterile liquid MS/1% 
(w/v) sucrose, with or without test substances. ATP content of samples was determined with a 
luciferin/luciferase assay (Molecular Probes), using a Fluostar Optima plate reading luminometer. 
Wounding was inflicted by moving a gloved finger up and down the roots to damage root hairs 
prior to immersion in assay medium. Results are mean ± SEM from three independent trials.
