Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in
skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system
have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and
skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male
Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n = 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we
found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued
progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the
distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deﬁcits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic
analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded
rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus
due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally
proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone.

INTRODUCTION
Reduction in mechanical loading occurs in many settings,
including cast immobilization, extended bed rest, neuromuscular
disorders, spinal cord injury, and spaceﬂight. Though dependent
on the duration and extent of unloading, these reductions in
mechanical loading lead to marked skeletal fragility, with reported
loss of bone mineral density (BMD) ranging from 10 to 40%1–5.
Thus, there is a need to develop strategies to mitigate bone loss
associated with reduction in mechanical loading. Such strategies
would be best informed by a better understanding of the nature
of disuse-induced bone loss.
Animal models of reduced mechanical loading have been used
to characterize bone loss and evaluate interventions designed to
prevent the deleterious effects of unloading. These models
include hindlimb unloading, cast immobilization, botulinum toxin
administration, and nerve injury6–10. While effective in reﬂecting
the musculoskeletal changes that occur with complete immobi-
lization or unloading, these models are limited in their ability to
assess musculoskeletal changes due to partial reductions in
mechanical loading that occur in many situations. For example,
there is an increased risk of fracture associated with muscular
dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and stroke11–13, where patients are
partially loaded. Furthermore, an animal model that could mimic
the musculoskeletal effects of fractional gravity, such as that
experienced on the Moon or Mars, could provide insights useful
for planning future space missions.
To address this gap in knowledge, we had previously developed
a partial weight-bearing (PWB) mouse model, and demonstrated
the degree of skeletal deterioration to be closely related to the
magnitude of unloading14,15. We recently expanded this PWB
model to rats, which again showed dose-dependent loss of bone
and muscle by varied reductions in weight bearing16–19. In the
current study, we aimed to extend this work with a comprehen-
sive evaluation of the time course of changes in bone density,
microarchitecture, and strength following exposure to varied
weight-bearing
levels
in
adult
rats.
We
also
incorporated
histomorphometric measurements to delineate the effects of
PWB on bone metabolism at the cellular level. We hypothesized
that partial reductions in mechanical loading will lead to
proportional, progressive deteriorations in bone density, micro-
architecture, and strength driven by increased bone resorption
and reduced bone formation.
RESULTS
In vivo longitudinal assessment of tibial metaphyseal trabecular
bone density showed both load- and time-dependent effects of
PWB (Fig. 1). The dose-dependent response to unloading was
evident as early as 1 week after unloading (test for trend, p <
0.0001). In particular, trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD) declined
by 18% in PWB20 (p < 0.001 vs baseline), 9% in PWB40 (p < 0.001
vs baseline), 9% in PWB70 (p < 0.001 vs baseline), and 5% in
PWB100 (p < 0.01 vs baseline). Whereas trabecular vBMD remained
stable in the PWB100 group over time, longer exposure to
unloading led to progressive declines in trabecular vBMD in all
groups, with maintenance of the dose-dependent response at all
subsequent timepoints (i.e., 2 and 4 weeks; test for trend, p <
0.0001). Notably, we did not observe any plateau in the decline in
trabecular vBMD. By 4 weeks after unloading, trabecular vBMD
had declined by 34%, 24%, and 23% from baseline in the PWB20,
PWB40, and PWB70 groups, respectively.
Unlike trabecular bone density, alterations in cortical bone
density at the mid-diaphysis were moderate in most groups. In the
PWB20 group at the 1-week (0.8%, p < 0.001 vs baseline), 2-week

(0.9%, p < 0.001 vs baseline), and 4-week (1.2%, p = 0.008 vs
baseline) time points. Also a slight increase in cortical bone
density was observed in the PWB40 group at the 2-week (0.9%,
p = 0.035 vs baseline) and 4-week (0.9%, p = 0.016 vs baseline)
time points.
Bone microarchitecture
MicroCT imaging revealed that trabecular microarchitecture in the
distal femoral metaphysis also deteriorated according to the PWB
level (Fig. 2a). For example, in the PWB20 group trabecular bone
volume/total volume (Tb.BV/TV) as 48% and 39% lower compared
to PWB100 after 2 and 4 weeks of unloading, respectively. Further,
Tb.BV/TV in PWB20 was ~40% lower than that of PWB40 and
PWB70 at 2 weeks. This decrease in Tb.BV/TV was due to both
thinning of trabeculae and reduced trabecular number (Fig. 2b).
Cortical bone microarchitecture at the femoral diaphysis was not
altered by PWB (Supplementary Table 1).
Quantitative histomorphometry
Deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture was due in part to a
decrease in osteoblast surface, which was 65% lower in PWB20
compared to PWB100 after 1 week of unloading. After 4 weeks of
unloading, osteoblast surface of both PWB20 and PWB40 were
78% and 63% lower than PWB100, respectively. Osteoclast surface
was unaffected by PWB (Fig. 3).
Consistent with the decrease in osteoblast surface, mineralizing
surface was decreased in the PWB groups. At 1 week, mineralizing
surface was 75% and 40% lower in PWB20 and PWB40,
respectively, compared to PWB100. This pattern was maintained
with increased unloading time, such that mineralizing surface was
71%
and
67%
lower
in
the
PWB20
and
PWB40
groups,
respectively, compared to PWB100 after 4 weeks of unloading.
PWB did not alter mineral apposition rate (MAR), though bone
formation rate (BFR) tended to be lower, with PWB20 being
signiﬁcantly lower than PWB100 at the 4-week time point.
Unlike alterations in remodeling activity at the trabecular bone,
dynamic histomorphometric outcomes were not altered by PWB

in cortical bone (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, however,
periosteal ﬂuorochrome labels were absent in rats that under-
went PWB20 for 4 weeks, and may indicate inhibition of
periosteal bone formation with longer duration unloading.
Accordingly, Ps.MAR, Ps.MS/BS, or Ps.BFR/BS could not be
calculated for these animals.
Femoral biomechanics
Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis revealed modest or
no deterioration of functional properties due to PWB (Fig. 4). At
2 weeks, diaphyseal stiffness in PWB20 was lower by 17.4%
compared to PWB100. At 4 weeks, all PWB groups exhibited lower
stiffness; 11.6% in PWB70; 13.2% in PWB40; and 12.1% in PWB20.
Estimated modulus was not altered by PWB.
DISCUSSION
We hypothesized that partial reductions in mechanical loading
would lead to proportional deteriorations in bone mass and
structure in rats, and that deﬁcits would be progressive with
unloading duration. We tested this hypothesis by examining
changes in bone density, microarchitecture, and strength
following exposure to varied PWB levels for durations ranging

from 1 to 4 weeks. Our results demonstrate dose-dependent
and progressive reductions in trabecular vBMD due to PWB, as
well as deterioration of trabecular, but not cortical bone
microarchitecture.
The strength of current study is assessing skeletal changes
induced by PWB at multiple time points. In particular, in vivo
longitudinal assessment of vBMD by peripheral quantitative
computed tomography (pQCT) overcomes the limitations of
cross-sectional ex vivo outcomes, such as microCT and mechanical
testing. Increased biological variability in outbred rat strains, which
were used in our study, further highlights the advantage of in vivo
longitudinal assessment of skeletal changes following PWB.
Accordingly, these in vivo measurements revealed a clear dose-
dependent response of trabecular bone density to the degree of
unloading. Also, rather than reaching a plateau, all PWB regimens
led to progressive bone loss for the 4-week duration of the study.
Few animal studies have performed long-duration unloading, thus
whether bone loss reaches a plateau remains an open question.
The progressive nature of the bone loss raises concerns for long-
duration spaceﬂight in the absence of successful bone-sparing
countermeasures. The oral bisphosphonate alendronate attenu-
ated the decline in BMD, but potential side effects, such as
gastrointestinal intolerance need to be considered20,21. Also,
advanced resistance exercise device mitigated bone loss, but
serum markers for bone resorption continued to be elevated22.
NASA is planning longer duration missions (perhaps up to 3 years)
in the next decades, yet we currently have limited data for skeletal
responses to spaceﬂight durations greater than ~6 months, as well
as safe and effective countermeasures. An extreme case of disuse
is seen following spinal cord injury. In these patients, bone loss is
rapid and extensive, but seems to plateau at ~50% bone loss 2–3
years after the injury5,23.
In contrast to observations for the trabecular compartment,
cortical bone experienced moderate or no deterioration from PWB
in these young adult rats. While cortical BMD measured by pQCT
was signiﬁcantly increased transiently, the increase was modest
(~1%) compared to changes in trabecular BMD. The relatively
even spread of cortical BMD compared to trabecular BMD among
different PWB groups suggests the stability of cortical bone
outcomes following PWB. Our prior studies in female C57Bl/6J
mice also showed robust dose-dependent bone loss in the
trabecular compartment, while the deterioration in the cortical
compartment was similar among different PWB groups15. The
greater response in trabecular bone is likely due to its greater
surface area than cortical bone24, which allows more basic
multicellular units to occur, which then leads to more rapid and
robust responses to altered mechanical loading environments25,26.
Prior studies in the hindlimb suspension model also show greater
loss of trabecular bone compared to cortical bone in rats27.
Another explanation is that to observe tissue and functional level
alterations in cortical bone, longer duration of PWB may be
needed. The lack of periosteal surface ﬂuorochrome labels in only
4-week PWB20 animals suggests that alterations in cortical bone
remodeling may only occur following longer duration exposure to
PWB, unlike the trabecular bone that was altered as early as 1-
week PWB. Disruption in periosteal cortical bone expansion will
likely lead to decrease in the total and cortical bone area, moment
of inertia, and ultimately decrease in biomechanical properties.
Data from histomophometry suggest that the deterioration of
trabecular bone subsequent to PWB appears to be driven by an
imbalance in trabecular bone remodeling, evidenced by a
decrease in osteoblast activity with no changes in osteoclast
activity. This observation is consistent with tail suspension studies
in rodents that report decreased osteoblast activity following
unloading28,29. Decrease in osteoblast activity seen in PWB groups
is likely due to increased sclerostin expression in osteocytes, which
has been observed in unloading studies30,31. Other studies have
shown that hindlimb unloading also increases osteoclast activity,
secondary to osteocyte apoptosis32, though we did not observe
increase in the number of osteoclasts. While this may suggest that
even a slight loading by PWB is sufﬁcient to prevent increased
osteoclast activity typically associated with unloading in rodent
skeleton, further studies are needed to determine whether the cell
and molecular mechanisms governing the response to PWB are
similar to those reported for other models of unloading. A recent
study
demonstrated
that
disuse-associated
skeletal
muscle
transcriptomic proﬁle in mice differs between cast immobilization
vs microgravity in the International Space Station, suggesting that
different modes of PWB/unloading may also deteriorate skeleton
via distinct mechanisms33. It remains unclear whether similar
mechanisms are involved in the response to skeletal overloading
and unloading34.
In addition to determining possible mechanisms that may
respond differentially to varying degrees of unloading, future work
is needed to address the current study’s limitations using a single
sex and age of rats. Notably, BFRs were higher in female than male
mice after 2 weeks of tail suspension35. Also, 2 weeks of unloading
by tail suspension led to larger deﬁcits in both the trabecular and
cortical compartments in male than in female rats36. These studies
suggest that female rats may perhaps be more resistant to
unloading-induced bone loss than males, though this needs to be
tested in the PWB model. Also, aging rats have been reported to
respond less to unloading-induced bone loss37,38, suggesting that
aged rats may be less responsive to PWB-induced bone loss.
Despite these limitations, using outbred Wistar rats for our study
added strength as the genetic variation is related to human
population39–41.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates dose-dependent trabe-
cular bone loss in rats, following exposure to differing levels of
quadrupedal PWB. The skeletal deﬁcits appear progressive, not
reaching a plateau by 4 weeks of PWB. Further elucidating
mechanisms underpinning this dose response may lead to the
discovery of novel mechanostat42 genes that can respond rapidly
to alterations in external mechanical unloading environment.
METHODS
Animals
Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA)
weighing 408 ± 0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a
temperature-controlled (22 ± 2 °C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle.
Water and chow were provided ad libitum. Throughout the experiment,
rats were assessed daily for any signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyrin
staining around eyes, poor grooming, and/or hair loss), harness and jacket
ﬁtting, ability to walk and move across the cage, as well as food and water
intake. At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and
hind limbs were harvested. After removing the surrounding soft tissue, the
left femur was wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and stored at −20 °C for
ex vivo microCT analysis and biomechanical testing, whereas the right
femur was stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for dynamic histomorphometry.
All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and
animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of
the IACUC.
In vivo PWB
Animals were assigned to one of four groups: normal loading (PWB100),
and 70% (PWB70), 40% (PWB40), and 20% (PWB20) of normal loading via
quadrupedal suspension. These PWB groups were chosen to mimic
gravitational forces on Earth (1 G), moderate artiﬁcial gravity (0.7 G), Mars
(0.4 G), and Moon (0.2 G). Animals were assigned to experimental groups
based on pre-PWB body weight to ensure similar average and variability in
body weight across all groups. Groups were suspended for 1, 2, or 4 weeks
(n = 11–12/group). Rats were assigned to each group to ensure balanced
distribution of the body weight across all groups. After 2 days of
acclimation in custom cages and jackets, rats were suspended according to
their PWB groups. Rats were secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness
and submitted to a two-point suspension allowing them to adopt a normal

quadrupedal behavior, while weighing 100, 70, 40, or 20% of their body
weight16. Animals were weighed daily in their PWB apparatus and the
chain link to the two-point suspension was adjusted if needed to ensure
that their achieved unloading level remained constant based on PWB
groups.
In vivo trabecular and cortical bone density measurement
At baseline and weekly thereafter, we assessed trabecular vBMD at the
right proximal tibia and cortical vBMD at the tibial mid-diaphysis, using
in vivo pQCT (Stratec, XCT Research SA+, Pforzheim, Germany). Scans were
performed using a voxel size of 100 μm and a scanning beam thickness of
500 μm. Daily calibration was performed using a manufacturer-supplied
hydroxyapatite phantom. Transverse images of right tibia were acquired at
5.0, 5.5, 6.0 mm (for total and trabecular vBMD), and at 20 and 20.5 mm (for
cortical vBMD) from the proximal tibial plateau. During the scan, rats were
under isoﬂurane-induced anesthesia.
Longitudinal images were visually inspected, and matched based on the
distance from the proximal tibial plateau and shape of the proximal tibial
metaphysis and ﬁbula to ensure anatomically consistent location for
analysis. Scanned slices were analyzed using Stratec software (Stratec XCT
Analysis System, v6.0, Norland Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI), using a
standardized analysis to determine cortical (contour mode 1, peel
mode 2, outer and inner threshold of 0.650 g/cm3) and trabecular (contour
mode 3, peel mode 4, outer threshold of 0.450 g/cm3, inner threshold of
0.800 g/cm3) vBMD16,43.
Ex vivo trabecular and cortical bone analyses
Microcomputed tomographic (µCT) imaging was performed on the distal
metaphysis and mid-diaphysis of the femur, using a high-resolution
desktop imaging system (µCT40, Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzer-
land) in accordance with the published guidelines for the use of µCT in
rodents44. Scans were acquired using a 15 µm3 isotropic voxel size, 70 kVp
and 114 mA peak x-ray tube potential and intensity, 300 ms integration
time, and were subjected to Gaussian ﬁltration. We determined femoral
length by measuring the distance from the femoral head to the distal end
of femoral condyles on µCT scans. The distal metaphyseal region that we
analyzed began 600 µm proximal to the distal growth plate and extended
proximally 2.1 mm. Cortical bone morphology was evaluated in the
femoral mid-diaphysis in a region that started 55% of the bone length
below the femoral head and extended 1050 µm distally. Global thresholds
of 360 and 700 mg HA/cm3 were used for evaluation of trabecular and
cortical bone, respectively. Trabecular bone outcomes included trabecular
bone
volume
fraction
(Tb.BV/TV,
mm3/mm3),
trabecular
thickness
(Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and separation (mm).
Cortical bone outcomes included cortical tissue mineral density (Ct.TMD,
mg HA/cm3), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, µm), total cross-sectional and cortical
bone areas (Tt.Ar, Ct.Ar, mm2), cortical bone area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %),
and the maximum and minimum moments of inertia (Imax and Imin, mm4).
Femoral stiffness
The frozen left femurs were thawed and subjected to three-point bending
(Instron 8511 MTS, Instron, Norwood, MA). To determine the femoral
stiffness (N·mm2), maximum moment (N·mm), and failure moment (N·mm),
each femur was loaded to failure on the posterior surface at a constant
displacement rate of 3 mm/min with the two lower supports spaced
20 mm apart. Force-displacement data were acquired at 100 Hz. Estimated
elastic modulus (MPa) was calculated using the moment of inertia derived
from microCT scans45.
Dynamic histomorphometry
To examine BFR, calcein (25 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at 10
and 3 days prior to sacriﬁce. Longitudinal 5-μm thick undecalciﬁed plastic
sections were used to measure static and dynamic parameters in
trabecular bone in the distal metaphyseal femur, using OsteoMeasure
software (Osteometrics; n = 5/group). For static histomorphometry, osteo-
blast (Ob.S/BS) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS) along the trabecular bone
was measured. For dynamic histomorphometry, mineralizing surface per
bone surface (MS/BS, %) and MAR (μm/day) were measured on unstained
sections to calculate BFR (μm3/μm2/day) according to ASBMR guidelines46.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA) and SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). To assess changes in in vivo
trabecular vBMD measured by pQCT, we used a linear mixed model
(ﬁxed variable: PWB, experimental duration, and their interaction;
repeated variable: experimental duration) followed by pairwise compar-
isons with Bonferroni correction. Ex vivo outcomes were analyzed by
two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc tests. To examine the
dose-dependent nature of the response to PWB, we performed a test for
trend47. Results are presented as mean ± SEM and were considered
signiﬁcant when p < 0.05.
