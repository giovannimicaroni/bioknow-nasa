Abstract
Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the estab-
lishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding
of how plants respond to spaceﬂight stress, we examined the signiﬁcance of the unfolded protein response
(UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the
model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome proﬁling in
wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space
Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes
compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the
ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceﬂight condition. Our results have yielded new
information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceﬂight induces the
activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream
transcriptional regulatory networks. Key Words: Spaceﬂight—Unfolded protein response—Arabidopsis—

1. Introduction
E
xtraterrestrial habitation and prolonged space
travel require successful plant growth to recreate livable
environments for humans (Ferl et al., 2002; Massa et al.,
2016; Zhou et al., 2019). Studies over the past 70 years have
sought to develop a better understanding of how plants are
affected by and adapt to the signiﬁcant stresses imposed by
spaceﬂight (e.g., microgravity, radiation, vibration, limited
exchange of gases), which can affect plant development and
yield (Paul et al., 2013). Recent iterations of the sophisticated
chamber hardware for plant growth housed on the Interna-
tional Space Station (ISS) have allowed for multigenerational
plant growth in space and analyses of plant responses to this
environment (Massa et al., 2016). However, these facilities
are insufﬁcient for large-scale plant growth on extraterrestrial
environments due to their size and resource cost. Therefore,
generation of germplasm adapted to stresses experienced
during growth in extraterrestrial environments is a critical
contribution to the realization of sustainable plant cultivation
in space.
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling cas-
cade that responds to a number of unfavorable environ-
mental and cellular stresses. The UPR is generally activated
by a buildup of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic re-
ticulum (ER), a condition known as ER stress (Ron and
Walter, 2007). The ER stress sensors conserved across
metazoans and plants include the ER-associated protein
kinase and ribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)
and ER membrane-tethered transcription factors (TFs)
(metazoan activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6] and plant
basic leucine zipper 17 [bZIP17] and bZIP28). Activation of
IRE1 leads to unconventional splicing of an intron from the
mRNA of an IRE1-downstream bZIP-TF (metazoan X-box
binding protein 1 and plant bZIP60). The UPR TFs are
translocated to the nucleus to control expression of UPR
target genes and restore ER homeostasis (Koizumi et al.,
2001; Chen and Brandizzi, 2012; Halbleib et al., 2017; Kim
et al., 2018; Ruberti et al., 2018; Tam et al., 2018; Mishiba
et al., 2019; Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019; Pu et al., 2019).
Insufﬁcient UPR leads to the actuation of cell death (Ron
and Walter, 2007; Walter and Ron, 2011).

In terrestrially grown plants, the UPR is a key mediator of
responses to a variety of stresses, including heat, pathogen,
and high light/singlet oxygen (Deng et al., 2011; Moreno
et al., 2012; Guillemette et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015,
2017; Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019; Beaugelin et al., 2020).
Additionally, analyses of higher order UPR mutants have
demonstrated that the UPR regulators are necessary for post-
embryonic growth and reproductive development in Arabi-
dopsis under unstressed conditions as well (Chen and
Brandizzi, 2012; Kim et al., 2018; Mishiba et al., 2019; Pu
et al., 2019). Therefore, a better understanding of the UPR
can enable efforts to potentiate plant stress responses and
improve plant yield.
Given the broad responsiveness of the UPR to environ-
mental stresses, we hypothesized that the UPR effectors
could coordinate gene expression reprogramming in space-
ﬂight stress conditions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed
global gene expression changes in wild type (WT) Arabi-
dopsis as well as loss-of-function mutants of IRE1 (ire1a
ire1b, herein dubbed ire1), bZIP28, and bZIP60 (single and
double mutants: bzip28, bzip60, bzip28 bzip60), cultivated
in orbit during the SpaceX CRS12 mission to the ISS. We
used these genetic backgrounds to identify genes controlled
jointly or speciﬁcally by the UPR sensors and UPR TFs and
deﬁne the extent to which the known signaling pathways of
the UPR functionally interact in a whole organism under
microgravity-associated conditions. We established that, in
space and on ground, gene expression undergoes a sub-
stantial reprogramming on a genome-scale. Growth in orbit
substantially altered the expression of thousands of genes
associated with signiﬁcant biological traits compared with
ground controls. However, while many of these spaceﬂight-
responsive genes were regulated uniquely in certain UPR
mutants compared with WT in the ground control, such a
genotype-speciﬁc regulation was not observed in the
spaceﬂight condition. These observations not only provide
new insight into how plants respond to spaceﬂight, but also
establish that spaceﬂight-induced transcriptional responses
mitigate the need for the gene-regulatory networks con-
trolled by the UPR sensors.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Launch hardware and experimental timeline
This ﬂight experiment utilized 4 Biological Research In a
Canister (BRIC) containing a total of 22 Petri Dish Fixation
Unit (PDFU) hardware (Wells et al., 2001) to cultivate
sterile dark-grown seedlings germinated aboard the ISS for a
14 day period. PDFU actuation chambers were loaded with a
tissue ﬁxative (RNAlater; Invitrogen) to preserve samples at
the conclusion of the ﬂight experiment. An identical set of
samples was prepared and grown on Earth with a 2-day
offset at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ISS Environmental
Simulator to allow for data transmission and reproduction of
incubation conditions experienced by ﬂight samples in orbit.
HOBO data loggers equipped with temperature sensors were
integrated into two of the four BRICs to record temperatures
experienced by samples during the experiment for post hoc
analysis. Launch samples (i.e., Arabidopsis seeds) were in-
tegrated into BRIC ﬂight hardware in a sterile hood *48 h
before the August 14, 2017, launch of SpaceX CRS12
spacecraft. Integrated science/hardware was kept at 4C to
maintain seed dormancy before packing in cold storage bags
while being loaded onto Dragon capsule and during launch.
After docking, samples were removed from cold storage
bags by ISS astronauts, warmed to ambient ISS temperature,
allowing seed germination and experiment initiation in the
BRIC. After 14 days, ISS astronauts actuated PDFUs, which
were then incubated at room temperature for a further 3 h
before being transferred to the ISS -80 MELFI freezer.
Samples were kept at approximately -80C until BRICs
were conditioned to -32C in double cold bag storage
(Hutchison and Campana, 2009) and stowed in the Dragon
capsule before undocking and atmospheric reentry on Sep-
tember 16. After returning to KSC, samples were stored at
-80C until de-integration of the ﬂight and ground samples.
De-integration occurred on November 1, 2017.
2.2. Germplasm and culture conditions
Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of the following genotypes
were used for ﬂight and ground controls: WT (Col-0 eco-
type), atire1 (Nagashima et al., 2011; Chen and Brandizzi,
2012), bzip60 (Moreno et al., 2012), bzip28 (Gao et al.,
2008), and bzip28 bzip60 (Deng et al., 2013). Petri dishes
(60 mm) were prepared with 6.7 mL of sterile ½ Murashige
and Skoog media supplemented with Gamborg’s B5 Vita-
mins (PhytoTechnology Laboratories), 0.5% sucrose (Sigma-
Aldrich), 0.4% Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH adjusted to 5.7.
In a sterile hood, seeds of WT and UPR-mutant genotypes
were surface sterilized with one wash of 70% ethanol, one
wash of 50% bleach containing 0.5% Tween 20, and then
nine additional washes with sterile H2O distilled twice. After
the ﬁnal wash was removed, seeds were resuspended in
1.5 mL sterile water for wet plating by using a 1 mL pipette
equipped with sterile ﬁlter tip. For each experimental unit
(ﬂight and ground control), ﬁve plate replicates of WT and
bzip28/bzip60 genotypes and four plate replicates of atire1,
bzip28, and bzip60 genotypes were prepared. Each plate
replicate contained 70–80 seeds evenly spaced in a grid
pattern on the plate surface. The Petri dishes were sealed with
Paraﬁlm (Heathrow Scientiﬁc), and individual plates were
then wrapped twice with sterile aluminum foil. Individually
wrapped plates were grouped by BRIC conﬁguration and
wrapped together with two more layers of sterile aluminum
foil before sample removal from the sterile hood. Plates were
placed at 4C until the integration of samples into science
hardware the following morning.
2.3. Sample processing and experimental
material assessment
Samples of ﬂight and ground control experiments were
preserved in RNAlater in situ and kept at -80C (see the
Results section for experimental timeline). The Petri dishes
were removed from packaging and thawed in groups of
three to prevent excess exposure to room temperature during
sample collection. After removing most of the RNAlater
from the plates, sterile forceps were used to transfer seed-
lings from the plates to microcentrifuge tubes containing
two glass beads. Seedlings were then frozen in liquid ni-
trogen. This procedure was carried out quickly to maximize
RNA recovery. Accordingly, only some pictures were taken
of plates before extraction for example purposes. Most
pictures were taken after the bulk of the sample was

removed, with the remaining seedlings also imaged for post
hoc inspection. All plates were free from any visible evi-
dence of bacterial or fungal contamination. Frozen samples
were ground to a powder with a Retsch Mixer Mill (Retsch,
Haan, Germany). RNA was extracted from tissues by using
a NucleoSpin RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions including DNase diges-
tion. The overall quality and RNA integrity number (RIN)
of RNA samples were assessed with Agilent Bioanalyzer
2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
2.4. Library preparation, sequencing, and
bioinformatics analysis
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were constructed
by using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library (Il-
lumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced in single-end mode
on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (50-nt) at Research
Technology Support Facility Genomics Core at Michigan
State University. For each library, read quality was assessed
with
the
FastQC
(version
0.11.3)
software
(https://
www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc).
Reads were cleaned for quality and adapter sequences with
Cutadapt (version1.8.1) using a minimum base quality 20 re-
taining reads with a minimum length of 30 nucleotides after
trimming (Martin, 2011). Quality-ﬁltered reads were aligned to
the Col-0 reference genome (TAIR10) with Bowtie (version
2.3.1) and TopHat (version 2.1.1) with a 10 bp minimum intron
length and 15,000bp maximum intron length (Langmead and
Salzberg, 2012; Kim et al., 2013). Fragments per kilobase exon
model per million mapped reads (FPKM) were measured by
using TAIR10 gene model annotation with Cufﬂinks (version
1.3.0) (Trapnell et al., 2010). The log2 transformed and nor-
malized gene expression levels (FPKM +1) were used for cor-
relation analysis (Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient)
between biological replicates and principal component analysis
(PCA). Per-gene read counts were identiﬁed with HTSeq (ver-
sion 0.6.1p1) in the union mode with a minimum mapping
quality of 20 with stranded reverse counting (Anders et al.,
2015). Differential gene expression analysis was performed in
four biological replicates (for WT and bzip28 bzip60, selected
based on the correlation with other biological replicates) with
DESeq2 (version 1.16.1) within R (version 3.4.0) based on a
comparison of spaceﬂight to ground with adjusted p-value <0.01
and absolute log2-transformed fold change >1.5 (Love et al.,
2014). Genes of which the total count across all samples is <100
were not included in the analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) over-
representation was performed with PANTHER (Fisher’s exact
type with false discovery rate correction) (www.pantherdb.org)
(Mi et al., 2019a, 2019b). K-means clustering analysis on av-
erage FPKM values from biological replicates was performed
using the Morpheus tool (Morpheus, https://software.broad
institute.org/morpheus). The optimal number of K-means clus-
ters was determined with the factoextra package in R.
3. Results
3.1. Spaceﬂight alters the growth of seedlings
independent of an intact UPR signaling
When we inspected the WT and UPR-mutant seedlings
(atire1, bzip60, bzip28, and bzip28 bzip60) of the ground
control and ﬂight samples at the completion of the mission,
we found that in the ground control samples, etiolated hy-
pocotyls (i.e., pale and elongated due to the lack of light)
were above the surface of the solidiﬁed media while roots
had penetrated the growth medium perpendicular to the
surface (Fig. 1A). However, in ﬂight samples, we found that
etiolated hypocotyls as well as roots had generally pene-
trated the growth medium regardless of genotype tested
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we also observed that cotyledon
petioles of ﬂight sample seedlings were elongated (Fig. 1B)
compared with ground control seedlings (Fig. 1A). Overall,
these observations are consistent with plant growth in the
darkness and space, conditions leading to elongated hypo-
cotyls and petioles, and a lack of directional growth, re-
spectively (Paul et al., 2017). These observations also
suggest that the UPR unlikely exerts a noticeable role in
growth direction in response to altered gravity levels.
3.2. Spaceﬂight results in an increase of total RNA
RNA degradation has previously been observed in inde-
pendent Arabidopsis spaceﬂight experiments performed in
BRIC-PDFUs (Paul et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2017). To
test the RNA quality of our samples, we measured RIN as an
indicator of overall RNA quality (RIN, 1 = low quality;
10 = high quality) of each sample and compared size peaks
of 25S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) among samples
(Mueller et al., 2004). Note that these measurements include
smaller plastid rRNA peaks, which lower the maximum RIN
value to around 8, independent of RNA quality (Babu and
Gassmann, 2016). We established that all ﬂight samples had
RIN values between 7.5 and 8.0, indicating that RNA was of
high quality. For ground samples, RIN values were found to
be between 4.0 and 7.7, which would ordinarily indicate
mild degradation of some samples. However, closer analy-
ses revealed that, in nearly all ground samples (77%), the
RIN algorithm failed to identify the correct peaks. In these
samples, the algorithm identiﬁed the 18S rRNA peak as the
25S rRNA peak, and a putative organelle rRNA peak (Babu
and Gassmann, 2016) as the 18S rRNA (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Therefore, to compare RNA quality between
treatments and genotypes from the Bioanalyzer data outputs,
we used the ratio of 25S/18S peak heights as a substitute
measure. Because the 25S peak height is reduced more
quickly than the 18S peak in RNA-degrading conditions
(e.g., elevated temperature, exogenous RNases, endogenous
apoptotic RNase activity) (Mueller et al., 2004; Babu and
Gassmann, 2016), a decreased 25S/18S ratio would indicate
RNA degradation. We observed no signiﬁcant differences of
the 25S/18S ratio across all genotypes (Fig. 2A); therefore,
both ﬂight and ground samples had no signiﬁcant RNA
degradation.
Interestingly, by comparing the 25S peak height with one
of the two other peaks near the 18S peak [i.e., a putative
organellular rRNA peak, designated 18S (-3); Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1] in each sample, it was clear that the relative
ratio of 25S to 18S (-3) was signiﬁcantly lower in the
ground samples compared with ﬂight samples (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S1). This low ratio indicates that the
ground samples were depleted of nuclear-encoded rRNAs
(i.e., 25S and 18S rRNAs) compared with other RNA spe-
cies. This observation is also consistent with our ﬁndings
that our ground samples contained signiﬁcantly less total
RELEVANCE OF THE PLANT UPR TO SPACEFLIGHT

RNA [of which rRNA is a signiﬁcant fraction (Lodish,
2000)] than ﬂight samples (Fig. 2C). Because we extracted
RNA from a similar number of seedlings from ﬂight
samples and ground samples, our results indicate that ﬂight
samples contained larger amount of total RNA compared
with ground samples, which is likely to be caused by ele-
vated levels of nuclear encoded rRNA in ﬂight samples,
and unlikely to be due to RNA degradation of the ground
samples.
3.3. Global transcriptomic analyses indicate that gene
expression reprogramming in response to spaceﬂight
depends partially on intact UPR signaling
Having established that the total RNA from ground and
ﬂight samples was of acceptable quality, we next proceeded
to RNA-seq to investigate the impact of spaceﬂight on
global gene expression changes in the UPR mutants. In
RNA-seq library preparation, mRNA was enriched by puri-
ﬁcation to efﬁciently remove rRNA (Zhao et al., 2018) and
mitigate potential sequencing bias due to higher rRNA levels
in ﬂight samples. We obtained an average of *32 million
reads per sample, of which 95–99% were successfully map-
ped to the Arabidopsis reference genome (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcients calculated
between biological replicates showed a high reproducibility of
our RNA-seq data set (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, PCA exhibited
a strong separation of ground samples from ﬂight samples
(Fig. 3B) and indicated that ground samples located more
closely to each other than the ﬂight samples. Overall, these
analyses further supported a statistical robustness of the RNA-
seq and justiﬁed further investigation.
To investigate gene expression changes in response to
spaceﬂight, we identiﬁed differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) in each genotype by comparing gene expression values
in ground and ﬂight samples (Supplementary Table S1). A total
FIG. 1.

RNAlater was removed to ensure maximal RNA integrity. Remaining seedlings were used for post hoc analysis of
morphological/growth differences. (B) Left: Example plate of a WT ﬂight sample, which was imaged after thawing, but

of 3465 genes were classiﬁed as DEGs in at least one of the
tested genotypes. WT had the largest number of DEGs (up-
regulated DEGs in ﬂight compared with ground, n = 1675;
downregulated DEGs, n = 831) among the genotypes tested.
The bzip28 bzip60 mutant had the smallest number of DEGs
(upregulated DEGs, n = 1293; downregulated DEGs, n = 562)
(Fig. 4A, B). In all genotypes, the number of upregulated
DEGs was higher than that of downregulated DEGs (WT,
2.02-fold; atire1, 1.98-fold; bzip28, 2.28-fold; bzip60, 1.80-
fold; bzip28 bzip60, 2.30-fold), indicating a higher impact of
spaceﬂight on inducing gene expression rather than suppres-
sing it. While the identity of 34.8% (783/2249) of upregulated
DEGs and 27.5% (335/1217) of downregulated DEGs over-
lapped across all genotypes, relatively smaller numbers of
DEGs were found to be genotype-speciﬁc, ranging from 30
(downregulated exclusively in bzip28 bzip60) to 207 (upre-
gulated in WT).
In summary, based on the veriﬁed number of upregulated
and downregulated DEGs in ﬂight samples compared with
ground samples across genotypes, the UPR mutants had
consistently fewer overall DEGs than WT, indicating that
the UPR could play at least a partial a role in regulating the
transcriptional reprogramming in space compared with
ground control.
3.4. Biological pathways connected to the DEGs
between ﬂight and ground
To gain insights in the biological pathways altered in
spaceﬂight in our experimental setup, we performed sepa-
rate GO analyses on upregulated and downregulated DEGs
in WT (Supplementary Table S2), generating a list of
parental-GO terms (more general, represented by a larger
number of genes in the reference gene set) and cognate
child-GO terms (more speciﬁc, smaller numbers of genes in
the reference gene set) (Fig. 5). Intriguingly, we found that
stress-responsive genes (e.g., ‘‘response to abscisic acid,’’
‘‘response to hypoxia,’’ ‘‘response to water deprivation,’’
and ‘‘response to oxidative stress’’) as well as genes in-
volved in physiological responses often associated with
stress response adaptation were enriched in downregulated
DEGs in WT. This result is consistent with previous studies
that reported downregulation of water stress-related genes
when using Arabidopsis BRIC-PDFU microarray tran-
scriptomes (Johnson et al., 2017) and that found abscisic
acid response and water stress response overrepresentation
in misregulated DEGs in Col-0 WT with RNA-seq (Choi
et al., 2019). In addition, we observed that metabolic pro-
cesses associated with stress adaptation (Hildebrandt Tat-
jana et al., 2015; Batista-Silva et al., 2019), including amino
acid catabolism and sucrose starvation response, were
overrepresented in ﬂight-downregulated DEGs. Ribosome
biogenesis, translation, and gene expression processes were
highly underrepresented in this category, that is, they were
more likely to be upregulated by ﬂight or remain unchanged.
By further analyzing the normalized gene expression values
(FPKM), we also found that ribosome biogenesis and rRNA
processing GO terms appeared signiﬁcantly overrepresented
in genes upregulated by >2-fold changes (ﬂight/ground).
These, however, were not considered as DEGs based on the
strict statistical criteria applied in our analyses (see the
Materials and Methods section). The lower FPKMs of

ribosome biogenesis-related genes in ground control sam-
ples are consistent with our observations that the ground
control samples were partially depleted of 25S and 18S
rRNA compared with ﬂight samples (Fig. 2C).
We also found that GO terms enriched in upregulated DEGs
included biological processes that have been noted in previous
Arabidopsis spaceﬂight transcriptome analyses, such as sec-
ondary metabolite biosynthesis associated with defense re-
sponses (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Furthermore,
we veriﬁed the dichotomous occurrence of the ‘‘absence of
light’’ and ‘‘response to red or far red (R/FR) light response’’
GO terms in the downregulated and upregulated gene sets,
respectively. The overrepresentation of photosynthetic com-
ponents in upregulated DEGs is partially consistent with the
results of a previous BRIC-PDFU experiment showing light/
high light response and some photosynthesis-related genes to
be differentially regulated in a subset of the tested genotypes
(Choi et al., 2019). In addition to the ﬁndings consistent with
previous spaceﬂight reports, we also observed a signiﬁcant
enrichment of DNA repair, DNA replication, and cell cycle
pathways in the upregulated DEGs, which could be possibly
associated with exposure of ﬂight samples, but not ground
samples, to ionizing radiation during spaceﬂight.
Together, these results indicate that in our experimental
conditions, spaceﬂight globally affects gene expression
changes associated with a broad array of signiﬁcant bio-
logical processes, largely identiﬁed also in previous space-
ﬂight transcriptome studies (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi
et al., 2019).
3.5. The UPR regulators exert a minor but signiﬁcant
role on gene expression in spaceﬂight
Next, we aimed to gain insights into the transcriptome
changes caused by the absence of an intact UPR signaling in
both ground and spaceﬂight conditions. To address it, we
performed K-means clustering analysis on FPKM values for
all DEGs (n = 3465) obtained in at least one genotype (Fig. 6
and Supplementary Tables S3 and S5) and then performed GO
analysis to correlate the expression signature of each cluster
with biological functions (Supplementary Table S4). Our
clustering analysis suggested that variations in the identiﬁed
DEGs between different genotypes (Fig. 4) were primarily the
result of variable FPKM values in the ground control samples
(Fig. 6). In ﬂight, the FPKM values were roughly equalized to
insigniﬁcantly different levels of expression across all geno-
types. Of the 3465 DEGs, in the ground samples, 517 DEGs
had FPKM values that were signiﬁcantly different ( p £ 0.01)
in at least one UPR mutant compared with WT; however, in
ﬂight samples, only 144 genes had FPKM values that were
signiﬁcantly different in at least one UPR-mutant genotype
compared with WT (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3).
The largest cluster (Cluster 1 DEGs; n = 2299) consisted
of DEGs upregulated to varying degrees in most of the
genotypes tested. As such, a nearly identical set of GO terms
that were enriched in upregulated DEGs in WT (Fig. 5) were
also enriched in Cluster 1. We then compared the FPKM
values of DEGs in ground samples across genotypes and
found that 39.1% and 19.8% of DEGs in Cluster 1 were
signiﬁcantly different in the bzip60 and bzip28 bzip60, re-
spectively, compared with WT, whereas only 4.6% and
2.9% of DEGs were signiﬁcantly different in bzip28 and
atire1, respectively, compared with WT (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Overall, these results indicate that bZIP60 has
functions that are independent of IRE1 and bZIP28, which
in turn are required to downregulate Cluster 1 DEGs in
ground control conditions. These observations are in ac-
cordance with the ﬁndings in ground conditions that bZIP28
and bZIP60 control some UPR target genes in an indepen-
dent manner (Ruberti et al., 2018).

In Cluster 2 (DEGs; n = 546), expression of DEGs was
induced exclusively in ground bzip60 compared with other
ground genotypes while highly suppressed to similar levels
of expression in ﬂight samples of all genotypes. As such, the
proportion of DEGs in bzip60, whose expression was sig-
niﬁcantly different from WT, was much higher (17%) than
other genotypes (bzip28 bzip60, 0.9%; bzip28, 1.0%; atire1,
1.2%) (Supplementary Fig. S4). We reasoned that bZIP28
and bZIP60 could have a negative feedback relationship in
which the absence of bZIP28 suppressed the effect of bzip60
mutation exclusively in the ground condition. The over-
represented GO terms in Cluster 2 were largely similar to
the GO terms enriched in the downregulated DEGs genes in
the WT genotype: ‘‘response to abscisic acid,’’ ‘‘response to
water deprivation,’’ and ‘‘response to hypoxia’’ (Fig. 5). In
addition, Cluster 2 DEGs showed signiﬁcant enrichment of
GO terms associated with biotic stress responses that were
not found in analyses of the WT genotype (Fig. 5) or found
to be strongly enriched in the any of the other clusters
(Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S4). These results indicate
that bZIP60 may have repressive roles in regulating genes
involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses.
The gene expression pattern of Cluster 3 (DEGs; n = 274)
was also characterized largely by genes with lower expres-
sion values in spaceﬂight compared with ground control
across genotypes, except for bzip28. However, contrasting
with Cluster 2, the FPKM values in the bzip60 genotype was
not different from WT FPKM values; only 3.2% of DEGs
showed signiﬁcant different FPKM compared with WT
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Instead, the absence of bZIP28

Differential expression analysis using the four biological replicates with the highest correlation was performed via

determined using a strict criterion: adjusted p-value <0.01; jlog2FCj >1.5. Total number of upregulated (A) and down-
regulated (B) DEGs in each background was analyzed to determine what proportion was shared between the different
genotypes. DEG, differentially expressed gene.

(i.e., in the bzip28 mutant) had a higher impact on gene
expression in the ground condition compared with other
mutants
(Supplementary
Fig.
S4).
Interestingly,
these
Cluster 3 DEGs had intermediate FPKM values in the
bzip28 bzip60 genotype in ground control compared with
the extremes of the bzip60 and bzip28 single mutants, in-
dicating an antagonistic regulation of bZIP28 and bZIP60 on
these genes in the ground condition, which was largely
compensated for in the bzip28 bzip60 genotype.
Similar to Clusters 2 and 3, Cluster 4 (DEGs; n = 55)
contained genes, whose expression exhibited overall lower
FPKMs in spaceﬂight compared with ground across geno-
types. However, Cluster 4 showed a unique pattern: the
expression of the DEGs in this cluster was signiﬁcantly
lower in bzip60 compared with WT and the other genotypes
in the ground condition (Supplementary Fig. S4) and
showed no prominent differences across genotypes in the
spaceﬂight condition. Although Cluster 4 was not signiﬁ-
cantly represented by any biological process GO terms, a
closer analysis revealed that 22% of all DEGs in this cluster
were encoded on the mitochondrial genome; mitochondria-
encoded genes comprise only 0.5% of all protein-coding
genes in the Arabidopsis genome annotation (https://
www.arabidopsis.org) and 0.3% of DEGs called in this
study.
Cluster 5 (DEGs; n = 291) showed a gene expression
pattern similar to Cluster 2 with signiﬁcantly higher levels in
the bzip60 genotype compared with the other genotypes in
the ground control samples (Supplementary Fig. S4). In this
Cluster, the DEGs were more affected by the absence of
bZIP28 (bzip28 bzip60 and bzip28) in the ground condition
compared with Cluster 2. The GO term ‘‘response to water
deprivation,’’ which was found to be enriched in Cluster 2,
was signiﬁcantly enriched in Cluster 5. In addition, rela-
tively narrow child GO terms ‘‘toxin catabolic process’’ and
‘‘glutathione metabolic process,’’ which were not enriched
in other clusters, were enriched in Cluster 5.
Overall, by comparing the bzip60 and bzip28 single mu-
tants with the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant, our tran-
scriptomic proﬁling provides evidence for a highly complex,
unconventional, regulatory relationship between bZIP60 and
bZIP28 under the conditions experienced by ground control
seedlings. Furthermore, a small number of signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between WT and the UPR mutants in spaceﬂight
were found, supporting a small but signiﬁcant role of the
UPR in gene expression in spaceﬂight.
4. Discussion
In this study, we examined the transcriptional responses
of WT and seedlings with a compromised UPR to space-
ﬂight to set the foundations to manipulate a critical growth
and stress signaling pathway for improving plant adaptation
to extraterrestrial environments. We utilized the BRIC-
PDFU sterile plant culture hardware during the SpaceX
CRS12 mission to compare the transcriptional responses
with the spaceﬂight between A. thaliana WT and mutants
defective in one or more components of the UPR, namely
the TFs bZIP60, bZIP28, and the ER-resident kinase/ribo-
nuclease IRE1.
The BRIC-PDFU hardware has been employed in a
number of dark-grown Arabidopsis transcriptome experi-
ments toward different aims (Paul et al., 2012; Kwon et al.,
2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Variability in
technical experimental details and limited overlap between
spaceﬂight/ground DEGs has been veriﬁed even between the
same WT control genotype in simultaneous experiments
(Johnson et al., 2017). However, some broad biological
pathways have been found to be induced or repressed in
response to spaceﬂight, including cell wall modiﬁca-
tion, response to light/high light, oxidative stress, osmotic
stress response, heat shock, and biotic defense/secondary
metabolite synthesis (Paul et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2017;
Choi et al., 2019). Many of these responses were also noted
in our study, including the downregulation of water stress
response in space, which has been identiﬁed in four sepa-
rate experiments (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019).
However, we also observed correlative differences in seed-
ling growth and an overall gene expression landscape not
noted in previous studies. Our ground control seedlings
had grown in a predictable manner, consistent with the
expected morphology of terrestrially grown Arabidopsis
etiolated hypocotyls (Fig. 1). Flight sample growth was
also largely in line with expectations for seedlings grown
in microgravity, including the observed petiole elongation,
which was shared in all ﬂight samples. Indeed, a petiole
elongation of ﬂight samples was also present in the images
published of dark-grown Arabidopsis experiments in the
Col-0 background in previous experiments (Johnson et al.,
2015; Paul et al., 2017).
This growth phenotype is consistent with low R/FR ratio
and shade avoidance syndrome mediated by phytochrome
signaling (Franklin, 2008). The correlative responses ob-
served in the transcriptome analysis (Fig. 4) support that
differentially regulated growth phenotypes and the large
transcriptional rearrangements in ﬂight during our experiment
might have been mediated by phytochrome-related signaling,
which is also known to constitutively repress abscisic acid
signaling (Yang et al., 2016), and were found to be repressed
in our ﬂight samples. However, these differences in the re-
sponse to light and the increased expression of photosynthetic
components between ground and ﬂight samples are anoma-
lous when considering the spaceﬂight culture methods used in
this study. BRIC-PDFUs are autoclavable, black polymer
containers, which are sealed with metal lids during science
integration, and allow injection of the chemical preservative
without opening the unit. After being sealed on August 12,
the seeds and seedlings germinated from these seeds in the
BRICs were not exposed to light during the launch and the
14-day growth period on the ISS. Therefore, the dichotomous
occurrence of the ‘‘absence of light’’ overrepresentation in
downregulated and of ‘‘response to R/FR light response’’ in
upregulated DEGs is unlikely to be the result of actual dif-
ferential exposure to light.
One likely explanation is related to the hypocotyl-tissue
media contact that occurred in our ﬂight samples, which
lacked a clear growth vector in microgravity, but had not
occurred in our ground samples where roots grew perpen-
dicular into the media. In previous experiments by Johnson
et al. (2015) and Paul et al. (2017), the dark-grown ground
control plates were oriented vertically and both sample sets
displayed petiole elongation, although the precise differ-
ences in length or extent of petiole elongation between ﬂight
and ground were not quantiﬁed. How media contact could

induce R/FR light signaling in the dark is not immediately
obvious; however, earlier studies showed that media con-
taining sucrose modulated the R/FR signaling mediated by
phytochrome A, promoting a red light response (Dijkwel
et al., 1997). Coincidentally, the higher rRNA and RNA
content observed in ﬂight samples compared with ground
control samples in our study (Fig. 2) is also consistent with
an increased exposure of cells to sucrose or glucose, which
is known to induce RNA accumulation, rRNA transcription,
and ribosome biogenesis in plants (Kojima et al., 2007;
Ishida et al., 2016), yeast (Kunkel et al., 2019), and
mammals (Hannan et al., 2003). Nonetheless, we cannot
rule out the remote possibility that our observations may
be inﬂuenced by possible interactions between ionizing
radiation and phytochrome R/FR signaling. For example,
low-dose gamma (g) irradiation of lettuce seeds was found
to mimic the effects of FR deactivation of red light-
activated phytochromes (Hsiao and Vidaver, 1974). Ad-
ditionally, a structural study of the bacterial phytochrome
from the radiation-resistant bacteria Deinococcus radio-
durans established that X-ray radiation induced deproto-
nation of chromophore in the inactive phytochrome, a
biochemical step thought to be involved in light-induced
activation of this protein (Li et al., 2015). Although the
dose required to deprotonate 50% of the phytochrome (Li
et al., 2015) was orders of magnitude larger than that
expected to be experienced during our experimental period
on the ISS, differences between prokaryotic and eu-
karyotic phytochromes could affect relevant properties of
a hypothetical phytochrome–radiation interaction.
Interpreting a role for the UPR in the transcriptional re-
sponse to spaceﬂight is complicated. We observed clear
differences in the number of spaceﬂight DEGs in the UPR-
mutant backgrounds compared with WT (Fig. 4); and only
1118 of the 3465 DEGs were common to all genotypes. This
would normally suggest that the transcriptional readjust-
ments that occurred in response to spaceﬂight were at least
partially the result of UPR-dependent processes. However,

in (B) Clusters 2 and 5, (C) Cluster 3, and (D) Cluster 4.
RELEVANCE OF THE PLANT UPR TO SPACEFLIGHT
377

upon closer analysis of the underlying FPKM values, it
became clear that the differences in fold change values
(ﬂight/ground) across genotypes were more heavily inﬂu-
enced by the differential regulation of expression in the
ground samples by the UPR regulators (Fig. 6). The number
of DEGs with FPKM values signiﬁcantly different from WT
FPKM values in at least one UPR-mutant genotype was four
times greater in the ground samples compared with ﬂight
samples (Supplementary Fig. S3). The heat map visualiza-
tion of these values (Fig. 6) further suggests that the vari-
ations in ground samples expression levels were largely
muted by spaceﬂight, as the endpoint transcript levels in
ﬂight samples were nearly uniform in the different geno-
types. Overall, this would suggest that the UPR does not
have a broad involvement in the response to spaceﬂight.
One explanation for this observation may be related to the
concerted downregulation of many stress-responsive pro-
cesses in the ﬂight samples compared with the ground
samples (Fig. 6). In spaceﬂight conditions, it seems likely
that alternative signaling pathways are actuated, which re-
press the observed stress responses regulated by the UPR.
Given the prevalence of starvation responses in ground
samples, it is possible that microgravity-induced changes in
growth habit provide better nutrient availability (Fig. 7). As
such, plants in ﬂight may be able to better handle the
stresses imposed by culture conditions, without requiring
UPR regulator involvement.
Nonetheless, the observations related to an interaction
between the UPR regulators bZIP60 and bZIP28 and the
stresses imposed on ground control seedlings have yielded
important information, which should be explored in the
future. In the canonical ER stress response induced chemi-
cally or via environmental stress, bZIP60 and bZIP28 TFs
interact in the nucleus and direct the actions of the COM-
PASS DNA methylation complex to increase transcription
of target genes (Song et al., 2015). Furthermore, these TFs
can also bind independently to gene promoters to activate
downstream UPR genes, as evidenced by the weaker acti-
vation of ER chaperones in the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant
compared with either of the bzip28 or bzip60 single mutants
(Ruberti et al., 2018; this work). Although it has been
suggested that bZIP60 and bZIP28 may also have unique
target genes (Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019), in our ground
control samples, the transcriptomic data suggest that bZIP60
and bZIP28 may have a more complex antagonistic rela-
tionship in the control of genes related to the response to
abscisic acid, hypoxia, water deprivation, and to oxidative
stress (Fig. 6). In Clusters 2 and 5, and Cluster 4, we ob-
served that the expression levels of the DEGs were higher or
lower than WT in the bzip60 genotype, respectively (Fig. 6
and Supplementary Fig. S3). However, these differences
were not observed in the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant as
would be expected. Conversely, in Cluster 3, we observed in
ground samples that the expression levels of the DEGs were
sharply lower in the bzip28 genotype compared with WT. In
the bzip28 bzip60 genotype, the genes in Cluster 3 had ex-
pression levels that were higher than the bzip28 genotype
but were also lower than those of these genes in the WT or
bzip60 genotypes. In response to chemically induced UPR
conditions, bZIP60 and bZIP28 cooperatively upregulate
several UPR genes (Song et al., 2015; Ruberti et al., 2018).
In our ground controls, the stress-responsive genes, largely
represented by ‘‘response to abscisic acid,’’ ‘‘response to
water deprivation,’’ and ‘‘response to hypoxia’’ abiotic
stress responses, were regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60 in a
way that suggests that these TFs have antagonistic regula-
tory effects on these processes (Fig. 7B–D).
The exact nature of the stress experienced by the ground
control seedlings would need to be elucidated to better un-
derstand the impact of this information on agronomic and/or
spaceﬂight applications. Studies on the effect of plant
growth in BRIC-PDFUs have already established that sig-
niﬁcant stress may be imposed on the seedlings grown in
these conditions (Johnson et al., 2015; Basu et al., 2017).
Consistent
with
our
results,
other
BRIC-PDFU
tran-
scriptomes have found a downregulation of genes related to
water stress responses (Johnson et al., 2017). However, as
evaporative water loss from the BRIC-PDFUs is unlikely
because they are sealed containers, the strongly represented
GO terms related to ‘‘response to water deprivation’’ and
‘‘response to abscisic acid’’ are unlikely to be a direct re-
sponse to actual water loss from the plates. Instead, it may be
possible that the ground seedlings with etiolated hypocotyls
that are not in contact with the media or have less overall
contact with the media are water stressed compared with
ﬂight seedlings that are in direct contact or have penetrated
the media. Independent of the underlying stimulus for the
observed differences, the possibility that bZIP60 and bZIP28
may have antagonistic interactions related to control of ab-
scisic acid signaling or water deprivation responses should be
investigated at the molecular level in the future to improve
plant growth and stress responses in space and on the ground.
