Cosmic kidney disease: an integrated pan-
omic, physiological and morphological study
into spaceﬂight-induced renal dysfunction
A list of authors and their afﬁliations appears at the end of the paper
Missions into Deep Space are planned this decade. Yet the health con-
sequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR)
over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney
are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, tran-
scriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical
chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (his-
tology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and
datasets available from 11 spaceﬂight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated
microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that
spaceﬂight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indi-
cate astronauts’ increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal
phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2)
remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted
tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction
when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.
The renewed zeitgeist for space travel, ushered in by the advent of
commercial spaceﬂight and tourism, has spurred on state-funded
agencies to embark on even more ambitious exploratory ‘Deep Space’
missions. The ﬁrst of these, namely the Artemis Program, Lunar
Gateway space station and later the Deep Space Transport/Mars
Missions, will for the ﬁrst-time place humans outside of Earth’s
protective
magnetic ﬁeld exposed
to
signiﬁcant quantities of
unmitigated space radiation and weightlessness for many months to
years at a time.
The health effects of low Earth orbit (LEO) spaceﬂight (e.g. the
International Space Station) are multiple, with much of the research
communities’ intense focus centred on the musculoskeletal, neurolo-
gical, ocular and cardiovascular degeneration that can manifest as
early as a few weeks into a mission. Notably, the effects of LEO
spaceﬂight on many other organ systems are less clear, with indis-
pensable organs such as the kidneys receiving relatively little attention
in the absence of overt symptoms. However, in the face of extended
periods of deep space travel health issues may only present with late
onset due to cloaked subclinical pathophysiology and chronic damage
eating into the extensive functional reserves of such organs.
The kidneys are critical in regulating blood pressure, by control-
ling both the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system (RAAS) and the
reabsorption of sodium chloride and water from the urine. In micro-
gravity, the cephalad redistribution of blood volume with the con-
comitant decrease in the pressure gradient should reduce kidney
perfusion. In turn, a lower perfusion pressure within the renal artery
should lead to a greater release of renin and activation of the RAAS.
However, studies show a marked reduction of diuresis and natriuresis
in space with the RAAS, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increasing
through unknown mechanisms1–3. These unexplained effects, be they
mediated through known homeostatic mechanisms, or more theore-
tical ones, such as tensegrity4, are germane to kidney stone formation
(i.e. nephrolithiasis). Astronauts have an unusually high rate of kidney
stone formation, with 1-year post-ﬂight astronauts experiencing inci-
dence rates of 2–7 times that of pre-ﬂight estimates, and in-ﬂight risk
estimated to be double that again5. This is of mission critical sig-
niﬁcance, one Soviet in-ﬂight renal stone episode nearly caused a
mission termination due to the severe symptoms, but was relieved by
spontaneous stone passage by the cosmonaut just before an urgent
deorbit was initiated6. It has been demonstrated that spaceﬂight

associated changes in urinary biochemistry favour kidney stone
formation7–9. Microgravity may have a direct effect on the crystal-
lisation and nucleation of nascent kidney stones10, but this is dwarfed
by the net biochemical urinary changes historically attributed to the
microgravity-induced bone demineralisation observed in spaceﬂight.
A school of thought that has led to a paucity of research into other
pathophysiological phenomena that may be contributing to the unu-
sually high incidence of nephrolithiasis.
The kidney is a plastic organ, and is capable of dynamically
remodelling the architecture of the nephron in response to changes in
blood pressure or dietary potassium. An 18 day potassium-free diet
resulted in a 31% increase in rat kidney weight, which was mainly seen
in the medullary collecting duct11. Changes in the size of nephron
segments in wild type mice have been observed using advanced ima-
ging techniques in a period as short as three days12. So, it is plausible
that spaceﬂight-induced shifts in ﬂuid and electrolyte handling could
precipitate maladaptive remodelling events that contribute to the
underlying pathophysiology.
In addition to the well-studied environmental stressor of micro-
gravity, deep space missions beyond the protection of the geo-
magnetosphere (the Van Allen belts) are exposed to space radiation.
Space radiation comprises both intermittent events (e.g. Solar Particle
Events or Solar Proton Events) with the most energetic being a Coronal
Mass Ejection and Solar Wind and Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR),
with GCR having the most signiﬁcant health impacts.
There is concern regarding the carcinogenic effect of GCR expo-
sure in the planned Mars Missions. However, the kidney is an exqui-
sitely radiation sensitive organ; it is the dose limiting organ in
abdominal radiotherapy13. Chronic kidney dysfunction can occur with
acute low linear energy transfer (LET) γ-radiation doses as low as <0.5
Gy14, the LET dose expected on a Mars Mission. However, GCR com-
prises low-LET x- and γ-rays with protons and high energy ‘HZE’ ions of
heavier elements (e.g. silicon, titanium, iron). It has been established
that exposure to HZE ions results in mitochondrial damage15,16. The
renal
proximal
tubule
is heavily dependent
on
mitochondrial
respiration17 and is one of the main tubular segments in which damage
is associated with kidney failure18. Indeed, proximal tubular injury is a
prominent
histological
feature
in
medical
(low-LET)
radiation
nephropathy19. Due to their dependence on mitochondrial aerobic
respiration, proximal tubular cells are extremely vulnerable to mito-
chondrial damage that we would expect from HZE exposure in addi-
tion to low-LET radiation damage.
We hypothesised that the biochemical urinary changes seen in
spaceﬂight might reﬂect functional and morphological changes
detectable in the kidney secondary to microgravity, possibly due to
abnormal renal perfusion.
Further, we hypothesised that GCR exposure will cause mito-
chondrial and therefore proximal tubular dysfunction, leading to tis-
sue damage and potentially irreversible loss of renal function, in
addition
to
the
known
micro
and
macrovascular
damage
caused by GCR.
In order to explore these questions, we took a pan-omics
approach incorporating anatomical and physiological parameters
from 20 independent human and rodent spaceﬂight missions/simu-
lations that had extant data and/or samples from which we could
generate novel data (Fig. 1).
Results
Primary changes in kidney function increase the risk of
spaceﬂight-induced nephrolithiasis
We analysed urinary and plasma parameters of interest for nephro-
lithiasis in 66 astronauts that stayed on the International Space Station
(ISS) for up to 180 days. Values were analysed across time, including
before, during and after ﬂight. Our data showed an increased urinary
excretion of metabolites and electrolytes that are considered risk
factors for nephrolithiasis (Fig. 2). In the ﬁgure, urinary excretion of
calcium is expressed as fractional excretion (FECa). In the absence of
plasma calcium abnormalities FECa should be < 1%; in astronauts, FECa
increases signiﬁcantly during ﬂight. This urinary abnormality nor-
malises on return to Earth (Fig. 2). A less signiﬁcant increase was seen in
oxalate, phosphate, uric acid urinary excretion during spaceﬂight, all
rapidly decreasing at return with some parameters transiently over-
correcting. Urinary citrate did not signiﬁcantly change and remained
within the normal range. There was also a decrease in urinary volume
during spaceﬂight and an increase in urinary osmolality (Fig. 2). Urin-
ary electrolytes (chloride, sodium and potassium) remained stable
during spaceﬂight compared to pre-ﬂight with the exception of mag-
nesium that, although within the normal range, signiﬁcantly increased
(Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 1A). Calculated values including estimated
glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR), aldosterone:renin ratio, FE for urin-
ary electrolytes and water, transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG)
and the ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate (TmP) to
GFR can be found in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1A, B. In addition,
Supplementary Fig. 1C shows plasma values from the SpaceX Inspira-
tion4 mission. Although these astronauts only spent 3 days in space,
there was a degree of eGFR instability detected several months after
returning to Earth.
Although, most of the metabolite changes support the emergence
of pro-lithogenic proﬁle during spaceﬂight, they do not entirely
explain the increased risk of nephrolithiasis in astronauts, suggesting
that there might be other previously unidentiﬁed mechanisms
underpinning this phenomenon.
To investigate this, we initially explored RR-10 spaceﬂight mouse
kidney tissue epiproteomic data to infer functional changes. Post-
translational modiﬁcations of channels, transporters and pumps can
alter their activity, and chief among these is phosphorylation status for
which we noted several thousand signiﬁcantly altered phosphosites
(Fig. 3a; Supplementary Data 1), suggesting a general increase in
phosphatase and decrease in kinase activities (Fig. 3b). In particular,
two of the most dramatically dephosphorylated proteins were the
thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), encoded by SLC12A3,
expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (and validated by phospho-
speciﬁc antibody staining in Fig. 3c) and furosemide-sensitive Na-K-Cl
cotransporter (NKCC2), encoded by SLC12A1, expressed in the thick
ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Fig. 3a). These transporters
requires phosphorylation of key residues at their N-terminus for
activation20, and NKCC2 is regulated by the calcium-sensing receptor
(CaSR) and genetic (i.e., Bartter syndrome) or pharmacological (e.g.,
furosemide) impairment of NKCC2 leads to hypercalciuria, and is
associated with nephrolithiasis. Whereas changes in NCC activity can
lead to alterations in calcium handling and bone mineral density.
To look for corroborating evidence of primary changes in renal
function, we analysed plasma and kidney tissue multi-omic data from
human and mouse samples (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 2; Supple-
mentary Data 2) for disease ontologies related to kidney stone for-
mation. The nephrolithiasis and related ontologies were heavily
represented across different datasets, providing orthogonal con-
ﬁrmation of real changes in the gene products comprising this ontol-
ogy for spaceﬂight conditions vs controls. For example, α-tubulin
(TUB1A1) is known to protect against cell-crystal adhesion21 but is
decreased across multiple kidney datasets in our study (Fig. 5; Sup-
plementary Data 3). In contrast, hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria
ontologies were scantily represented, implying that standard terres-
trial causes of dysregulated urinary calcium and oxalate were not
particularly enriched and therefore not strongly implicated in kidney
stone formation.
The directional changes in nephrolithiasis-related faecal micro-
biome abundances between spaceﬂight and ground controls are illu-
strated in (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Data 4). Overall, these microbiota
changes paint a mixed picture with some changes expected to confer a

protective proﬁle against nephrolithiasis and others tending to con-
tribute to increased risk, implying that the increased urinary oxalate
excretion is unlikely to be primarily diet or microbiota-dependent.
Nevertheless, whole faecal microbiome KEGG analysis shows some
enrichment of glyoxalate (a precursor to oxalate) and arginine meta-
bolism (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Pathway analysis of novel plasma metabolomic data from humans
and rodents under spaceﬂight conditions (Fig. 4c; Supplementary
Data 5) shows a striking over-representation of Aminoacyl-tRNA bio-
synthesis and arginine biosynthesis metabolic pathways.
Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis is the ubiquitous housekeeping
process of charging amino acids to their cognate tRNAs and providing
the substrates for global protein synthesis. In addition to this canonical
function, it has become clear that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are
involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes
including angiogenesis, inﬂammation, translational control and post
translational modiﬁcation22–24.
Arginine

nephrolithiasis25 and glycerophospholipids are the main lipid compo-
nent of cell membranes and pathway enrichment is compatible with
remodelling events (reviewed by Han26). Citric Acid Cycle pathway is
common to many metabolomic analyses of oxalosis.
Structural remodelling of the nephron occurs within a month of
spaceﬂight exposure
To investigate whether renal remodelling was occurring in spaceﬂight,
we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis across 24 datasets
obtained from 2 human and 13 rodent spaceﬂight missions and 2
rodent GCR simulation experiments. The datasets were epigenomic,
transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic. GO pathways
(Fig. 6a; Supplementary Data 6) that are repeatedly signiﬁcantly enri-
ched across the datasets are compatible with remodelling events
occurring in the kidney, these include regulation of cell adhesion, actin
ﬁlament organisation, epithelial tube morphogenesis and renal system
development pathways.
Enriched KEGG pathways (Fig. 6b; Supplementary Data 7 likewise
include focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction, sphingolipids,
actin and cell cycle pathways, again consistent with remodelling.
Proteomic analysis of urine from the Russian Roscosmos human
spaceﬂight mission (Fig. 6c) shows extracellular matrix (ECM) and
lipid-turnover related proteins that were enriched 7 days after space-
ﬂight compared to baseline. These include Fibronectin (FN1; involved
in the organisation of the ECM), Cathepsin B (CTSB; maintains turnover
of glomerular basement membrane27), Apolipoprotein H (APOH; which
binds to cell surface phospholipids) and Proactivator Polypeptide
(PSAP; involved in the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids). Nota-
ble among these are Nidogen-1 (NID1; a key part of the nephron
basement membrane) and Podocalyxin (PODXL; a major constituent of
the glycocalyx of podocytes in the glomerulus) which are two of the
most frequently downregulated gene products across kidney datasets
in our study (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 3).
To determine the extent of any potential structural remodelling,
we looked for macroscopic changes in GCR and/or microgravity

mice (28 days). Regulatoryphosphosites in transporters and channels related to the
thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule are high-
lighted. Green indicates a statistically signiﬁcant increase in peptide phosphoryla-
tion, magenta indicates a decrease, and grey represents no signiﬁcant change. An
unadjusted two-tailed -Log10(Adjusted P-value) of 1.3 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant (indicated by the dashed line intersecting the x-axis). Kir4.1 (KCNJ10);

performed using the Robust Inference of Kinase Activity (RoKAI) App v2.2.1 to
predict kinase and phosphatase activity levels using phosphoproteomics from RR-
10 spaceﬂight-exposed mice (28 days) kidney tissue. Bars in blue represent
downregulated activity and those in red represent upregulated activity. An adjus-
ted P-value of < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. Data are mean SEM. An FDR of 5%
was used as a cutoff. N = 10 biologically independent animals per group (ﬂight vs
ground control). 4257 single-site phosphopeptides (Ser/Thr/Tyr) were used as
initial input, 495 of which were matched to known kinase/phosphatase targets, that
were then used to calculate respective predicted kinase/phosphatase activities.

exposed rodent kidneys. Much like Elger and co-workers11, who found
an increase in kidney weight of 30% in chronically potassium depleted
animals, we found that microgravity (simulated) and microgravity
+GCR (real and simulated) exposed animals had signiﬁcantly greater
kidney weights (relative to bodyweight) than control animals (Fig. 7a).
To establish that these changes weren’t merely due to alterations
in extracellular ﬂuid content, quantitative and qualitative histomor-
phometry was performed on mouse kidneys from the RR-10 space-
ﬂight mission. Samples were
stained
for the canonical distal
convoluted tubule marker Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC; encoded by
SLC12A3), as this segment is known to be the most plastic in the
nephron. Our data suggest that RR-10 mice have chronic depho-
sphorylation of NCC in addition to potentially altered basolateral
potassium handling via Kir4.1/5.1 and KCC4, both of which are known
to induce distal convoluted tubule remodelling12,28 (Fig. 3a, c; Supple-
mentary Data 1).
Qualitative assessment of 3D images of optically cleared tissues
revealed no obvious lesions or anatomical abnormalities (See videos in
Supplementary Movie 1 & 2). However, quantitative analysis of distal
convoluted tubules revealed that spaceﬂight led to a reduction in
tubule density, but that these retained tubules had a larger average
size, demonstrating tubular segment remodelling (Fig. 7b, c).
Multi-omic analyses reveal convergent disease pathways
induced by spaceﬂight
To understand the common processes occurring across the multiple
human and rodent, spaceﬂight and GCR exposed missions, omics data
were analysed against DisGeNET, KEGG and GO databases. Sig-
niﬁcantly enriched kidney-relevant disease ontologies that were
reproduced in our diverse cohort of datasets were plotted in Fig. 8 for
DisGeNET (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2).
Many of the same ontologies are represented in both the space-
ﬂight and simulated GCR experiments. Ontologies that are particularly
enriched include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous
glomerulonephritis, reﬂecting the presence of acute phase and
inﬂammatory gene products in addition to the proﬁbrotic and cell
death gene products represented in the chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stage 5, renal ﬁbrosis and renal insufﬁciency ontologies. The heavily
enriched peripheral vascular disease and endothelial damage ontolo-
gies reﬂect the known endothelial and microvascular damage marker
gene products enriched across the multiple GCR and spaceﬂight
datasets.
Mitochondrial diseases are enriched in the proteomics datasets of
kidney tissues (Fig. 8) and is further supported by the enrichment of
ontologies relating to mitochondrial suborganellular structures, oxi-
dative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species,
apoptosis, cellular senescence, HIF-1 and TNFα signalling in GO (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Data 6) and KEGG (Supplementary
Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 7) over-representation analyses. Mito-
chondria may also be showing signs of stress-induced fusion (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6), although future studies would be needed to
speciﬁcally address changes in mitochondria morphology.
As a ﬁnal step we used the Scalable Precision Medicine Open
Knowledge Engine (SPOKE)29 knowledge graph tool which is capable of
integrating heterogeneous datasets from various biological levels,
assay modalities, tissue types, organisms and experimental conditions
to validate our ﬁndings (Supplementary Fig. 7).
A GCR exposure with a dose-equivalent to a Mars roundtrip
induces renal damage and dysfunction
LEO spaceﬂight mission participants are exposed to comparatively low
doses of GCR due to the protection provided by Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
Therefore, to disentangle the impacts of GCR from microgravity and
evaluate the consequence of unmitigated GCR exposure, we examined
tissues that had only been exposed to simulated GCR. To do this we
utilised NASA’s ground-based GCR simulator at Brookhaven National
Laboratory, where animals either had an acute exposure to a ~ 1.5-year
dose-equivalent (0.5 Gy) in the simpliﬁed 6-beam/5-ion GCR simulator
followed by rapid 24 h sacriﬁce (BNL experiments) or were given an
acute exposure to a ~ 2.5-year dose-equivalent (0.75 Gy) in the full 33-
beam/7-ion GCR simulator with sacriﬁce at 6 months post-exposure
(NSRL-22A experiment).
Pathogenic serum miRNA species have been previously impli-
cated to mediate tissue damage in spaceﬂight30, and GCR is a plausible
pathogenic factor. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of
plasma miRNAs revealed three clusters that generally trended down-
ward in BNL-1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, investigation of
miRNA predicted mRNA targets and DisGeNET analysis of these targets
suggested that these circulating miRNAs would be minor players in the
context of renal damage in the acute setting (Supplementary Data 8).

Retaining biomolecular information within the gross and micro-
anatomical context is important, especially when highly heterogenous
tissues like the kidney (Fig. 9a). So, we next performed in situ hybri-
disation (RNAScope) and quantitative whole slide imaging to ascertain
the presence and density of these pathogenic miRNAs in kidney tissues
of BNL-3 mice. miR-125b was signiﬁcantly increased in the inner stripe
of the outer medulla (ISOM) (Fig. 9b), particularly in the vascular
compartment (arrows) which corresponds to the thick ascending limb
of the loop of Henle, the thin descending limb of the loop and the
medullary collecting duct. miR-16 has a similar pattern of distribution
and differential expression but fails to reach signiﬁcance (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9). These miRNA species are implicated in vascular
damage and the ISOM is also the site of the vascular bundle31, a com-
plex structure which is the bottleneck of all blood ﬂow to and from the

inner medulla. Additionally, mRNA target prediction, KEGG and Dis-
GeNET analysis of miR-125b and miR-16 suggest that these may med-
iate cell senescence, apoptosis, TGFβ signalling and oncogenesis
(Supplementary Fig. 9).
To further understand the effect of simulated GCR on the
segment-speciﬁc cell types of the kidney’s nephron (Fig. 9a), we per-
formed 2D spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq32) on BNL-1 GCR-exposed
renal tissue. Cell types were inferred using a published renal cell atlas33,
which were mapped onto individual data points which accurately
reproduced anatomy (Fig. 9c). Individual signiﬁcant transcriptional
changes in speciﬁc cell types were then examined and top hits were
analysed by KEGG and DisGeNET (Fig. 9d; Supplementary Data 10).
Interestingly, immunoglobulin components were among the hits
overexpressed by loop of Henle cells, presumably reﬂecting increased
B-cell activity in the interstitium as supported by enrichment of the
KEGG pathway for “leukocyte transendothelial migration” (Supple-
mentary Data 10). SGK1 transcriptional activity was decreased in
proximal convoluted and straight tubule cells (Fig. 9d). SGK1 is a
master regulator of multiple epithelial membrane transporters,
including canonical segment speciﬁc transporters. The data also sup-
port disruption of circadian rhythm in several tubule segments via
Cytochrome-1 and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1
(also known as Rev-Erbɑ; encoded by NR1D1)34 (Fig. 9d), and hits on
KEGG and DisGeNET (Supplementary Data 10). When it comes to
damage markers, again the proximal straight tubule and thick
ascending limb of the loop of Henle appear to be the most impacted,
with decrease in ALAS1, and increases in ANGPT2 and KRT18 all prog-
nostically poor for renal outcomes35–37 (Fig. 9d).
From a radiobiological perspective, the kidney is considered a
late-responding tissue, and studies spanning at least 1-2 years may be
required to appreciate the full impact of chronic GCR exposure on
kidney
health38.
Although,
some
features
of
radiation-induced
nephropathy and sub-clinical manifestations can emerge in < 6
months post-irradiation. To investigate this, serial tissue sections from
NSRL-22A mice were histochemically stained for routine examination
of potential kidney damage (haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s tri-
chrome stain, Martius Scarlet Blue) were examined by a blinded expert
histopathologist (Fig. 10a).
No histological evidence of differences in interstitial ﬁbrosis or
tissue calciﬁcations were observed between Sham and GCR exposed
tissues stained with PAS, Picrosirius Red and Von Kossa (Fig. 10a). To
conﬁrm this, we quantitated the fractional interstitial area in the PAS
stains which showed no difference between groups (mean 6.10% ± 2.10
vs 6.16% ± 2.27. p = 0.9623). As previously reported, ﬁrst signs of
ﬁbrosis or calciﬁcations may not present until after 6 months38, and
therefore NSRL-22A may be too short a period to observe these disease
features, despite signiﬁcant enrichment of ﬁbrosis-related DisGeNET
ontologies in the kidney proteomics from the same animals (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2). However, consistent with
radiation-induced nephropathy, overt thrombotic microangiopathy
was detected in GCR exposed tissues from 27% (3/11) female animals,
and 0% (0/12) male animals. None was seen in tissue from sham
exposed animals (Fig. 10a).
Given the biomolecular and histopathological signs of renal
injury, we then looked for functional evidence of glomerular, proximal
tubular and distal tubular dysfunction. Urinary and plasma biochem-
ical analyses (Fig. 10b; Supplementary Fig. 10) showed signiﬁcantly
greater urinary protein excretion in GCR vs sham animals, consistent
with a glomerular lesion or proximal tubule dysfunction, the latter
supported by the reduction in the endocytic receptor megalin (LRP2)
which normally reabsorbs proteins that escape into the ultraﬁltrate
(Fig. 5). There was a slight increase in urinary glucose, which is a highly
speciﬁc, but not very sensitive marker of proximal tubular dysfunction
in non-diabetic animals. While this did not reach signiﬁcance
(p = 0.1198), there was signiﬁcant downregulation of sodium-glucose
linked transporter, SGLT1 (SLC5A1) (Fig. 5), that would be consistent
with proximal tubule dysfunction. Finally, there was signiﬁcantly
greater magnesiuria in GCR exposed animals, consistent with down-
regulated magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle or the distal
convoluted tubule.
Discussion
We have presented a large volume of data encompassing both human
and rodent data, extant and novel multi-omics datasets, historical and
extant clinical chemistry and novel imaging data from 16 spaceﬂight
missions and 4 GCR exposures to examine the effect of spaceﬂight on
kidney function.
Tubular remodelling, by which we mean structural and functional
adaptation of the tubular nephron to environmental stimuli, is a well
described yet underappreciated phenomenon. Tubular remodelling
occurs not only in response to genetic modiﬁcation of signal
pathways39, but also chronic diuretic exposure40, kidney injury41, and
both chronic11 and acute42 hypokalaemia. These changes occur rapidly,
within 3 days of diet induced hypokalaemia12.
Our data robustly and orthogonally supports tubular remodelling
occurring in microgravity with and without GCR. This is highly likely to
have functional consequences, as tubular remodelling does in other
scenarios39.
Renal remodelling in microgravity (possibly related to the
cephalad ﬂuid shift) may therefore be a primary event that causes
subsequent dysregulation of serum and urine electrolyte homeostasis.
This is supported by the prompt return to baseline of humans on
return to terrestrial gravity.
Changes in urinary biochemistry are known to be critical in the
pathogenesis of kidney stone formation; a condition that occurs dis-
proportionally commonly in astronauts, and that is potentially mission
critical.
The increased risk for nephrolithiasis in space has been histori-
cally attributed to the negative impactof microgravity on bone mineral
density that leads to increased resorption of bone, release of calcium
salts in the bloodstream, increased renal load and therefore increased
urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate6,8. Our historical data
(from 66 astronauts) conﬁrms hypercalciuria, and the phosphopro-
teomic data shows decreased phosphorylation of NKCC2 (SLC12A1),
which will cause decreased paracellular reabsorption of divalent
cations in the loop of Henle, and thus renal calcium and magnesium

b, downregulated gene products in exposure groups (e.g. spaceﬂight, GCRsim)
compared to control groups (e.g. ground control, sham). To integrate datasets
from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules
(e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted
to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene
symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites,
isoforms, CpG sites). These differentially regulated gene products (DRGP) were
ranked and represented in descending order using the following rules: (1) only
DRGPs with a P-value < 0.05 by Wald test were counted as signiﬁcant and plotted;
(2) Each DRGP was assigned a score of +1 each time it was upregulated or −1 each
time it was downregulated; (3) only DRGPs observed in proteome and tran-
scriptome kidney-speciﬁc datasets were used for the calculation of the ranking
score to avoid confounders, although additional datasets (epiproteome, epigen-
ome and those from plasma/exosomes sources) were plotted for visualisation
comparison purposes; (4) The resulting sum of scores for each DRGP was then
calculated and multiplied by the number of times the DRGP was observed in the
kidney-speciﬁc proteome and transcriptome datasets; (5) To increase conﬁdence
only DRGPs with a product score of absolute value 9 or higher (but excluding a
score of 12) were plotted as these will have a directionality consensus of at least 3
datasets above the number of disagreeing datasets.

wasting. Hypocitraturia was not observed; this is in line with previous
observations by Pietryzk et al. of an approximate rate of 14% of
hypocitraturia during spaceﬂight6, and Whitson et al. who found no
signiﬁcant hypocitraturia8.
Hyperoxaluria also occurs during spaceﬂight. Oxalate is freely
ﬁltered by the glomerulus and almost entirely excreted in the urine.
Increased urinary oxalate reﬂects increased plasma oxalate load that
could come from either increased endogenous liver production or
increased absorption by the gut. The latter could be caused by several
conditions such as increased dietary oxalate, malabsorptive conditions
or altered microbiome. Dietary data were not available, and we
assumed an absence of malabsorptive conditions. However, we do
know that spaceﬂight affects the gut microbiome43. Metagenomic
analysis of the microbiome showed that in the highest quality faecal
microbiome dataset (namely RR-23) Oxalobacter sp., the bacterium
primarily responsible for oxalate metabolism44, increases during
spaceﬂight. Bacteroides, a bacterium that was found to be increased in
stone formers45, and Biﬁdobacterium, a pro-biotic able to metabolise
oxalate in the gut46, were enriched and depleted in spaceﬂight
respectively. It is difﬁcult, based on low replicability of data to ascribe a
primary,
or
even
secondary
microbiome-related
aetiology
for
increased stone formation in spaceﬂight.
Proposed interventions to prevent potential mission critical kid-
ney stone formation in spaceﬂight include increasing urine output by
maximising oral ﬂuid intake47, oral potassium citrate48 (or potassium
magnesium citrate49) supplementation and inﬂight management,
including ureteral stenting50 and lithotripsy51. While these are sensible
and may indeed be effective, none deal with the hypercalciuria that has
been consistently shown in human space travellers. Oral or parenteral
bisphosphonates have been used with some success52. Further, thia-
zide diuretics reduce urinary calcium excretion53 (possibly by ECV
contraction
causing
increased
proximal
tubular
calcium
reabsorption54) and reduce age related bone mineral density loss55, and
could represent a “two birds with one stone” therapeutic option.
Could the dephosphorylation of NKCC2 guide us toward a ther-
apeutic target to reduce spaceﬂight induced hypercalciuria? NKCC2
activity is modulated by the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) via
phosphorylation56, and calcilytics (CaSR antagonists), well tolerated
but disappointing agents in their utility for treating terrestrial
osteoporosis57, might be one potential avenue to manipulate NKCC2
activity to ameliorate spaceﬂight induced hypercalciuria.
Abnormal water homeostasis has been noted in astronauts since
the early days of spaceﬂight, with a marked reduction in both diuresis
and
natriuresis
with
vasopressin
dysregulation
via
unknown
mechanisms1–3. In fact, the reduced NKCC2 activity would conversely
be anticipated to enhance diuresis, much like a loop diuretic. In this
context, downregulation of prostaglandin transporters (PGT; encoded
by SLCO2A1), a result seen in multiple of our proteomic and tran-
scriptomic datasets (Fig. 5), is intriguing and may offer a way to
reconcile this paradox. As carriers of a gain-of-function mutation of
SLCO2A158, see a reduction in PGT activity in the proximal straight
tubule and the cortical collecting duct which colocalises with
Aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Loss of PGT-mediated reabsorption by collecting
duct principal cells, causes a subsequent build-up in the luminal con-
centration of the prostaglandin PGE2, which stimulates apical pros-
taglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP4) receptors to activate Aquaporin-2 and
inappropriate water reabsorption. In our study the loss of NKCC2
activity through dephosphorylation and reduction of PGT abundance
can offset each other.
Tubular remodelling in spaceﬂight raises another, interesting
question; is the hypercalciuria seen in spaceﬂight a consequence or
cause of spaceﬂight related loss of bone mineral density (BMD)? We
know that primary renal phenomena associated with tubular remodel-
ling (e.g. genetic inactivation of SLC12A1 in Bartter syndrome59 or chronic
furosemide exposure60) can cause a loss of BMD as a consequence of the

primary hypercalciuria. This implies that renally targeted therapies (e.g.
thiazides, calcilytics) will be effective. There does appear to be a syner-
gistic effect of microgravity and GCR on BMD loss; GCR does have pri-
mary bone effects, increasing osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in
rodents16, so bone targeted countermeasures will still be relevant.
The kidney is a key microvascular end-organ and microvascular
disease appears to be one of the main consequences of GCR
exposure30. We concur with this view: vascular disease and endothelial
dysfunction disease ontologies were highly enriched across omics
datasets (Fig. 8). Consistent with this, the arginine biosynthesis path-
way was highly enriched across our human and mouse datasets
(Fig. 4c), there was a signiﬁcantly increased amount of pathogenic miR-
125b in the highly vascular ISOM (Fig. 9b) and as a likely consequence
of this microvascular pathology, we observed incidences of throm-
botic microangiopathy on histopathological examination (Fig. 10a).
In addition to this, pathophysiological macrovascular changes are
a well-documented consequence of microgravity, with 6 months in
space shown to induce ~ 20 years of vascular ageing through arterial
stiffening61. The resultant loss of vascular elasticity, and thus buffering
capacity, leads to elevated transmission of blood ﬂow and pressure
pulsatility to the microvasculature. Long-term, this can cause baro-
trauma

suboptimal perfusion, especially as the myogenic response of the
afferent arteriole is to vasoconstrict and provide resistance (and thus
reduce ﬂow) in the face of excessive pulsatile pressure62. Indeed
arterial stiffness and CKD are strongly associated, and it is thought that
one begets the other in a positive feedback loop63. Taken together with
the general drop in blood pressure experienced by astronauts64,
exposure to spaceﬂight long-term places the kidney in an impossible
position whereby it must choose whether to defend renal perfusion or
the health of its microvasculature. If the arterioles dilate to enhance
blood ﬂow, they leave the microvasculature open to damage from

unbuffered pressure waves on top of the radiation damage caused by
GCR. Whereas if they constrict to provide protection to the micro-
vasculature, they reduce blood ﬂow and therefore oxygen supply to
the renal tubules, which further compounds and exacerbates the
chronic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction from GCR
bombardment.
This study is the largest to ever look at the effect of spaceﬂight on
kidney function. We have demonstrated that there is renal structural
and functional remodelling likely caused by microgravity, probably
synergistically with GCR. We have shown that this remodelling is a
potential driver of kidney stone formation and many of the changes in
the urinary biochemistry of humans and animals experienced by those
exposed to LEO spaceﬂight. We have also shown that acute exposure
to simulated GCR causes both acute and chronic tubular epithelial and
vascular damage that appears both progressive and irreversible.
However, our study has several limitations. We have necessarily
relied on human (mostly male) and animal (mostly female) data from
missions which were exposed to microgravity for relatively short
periods of time compared to the projected length of a Mars mission,
and only in LEO, which also limited the amount of GCR and other space
radiation that they were exposed to. Additionally, our simulated GCR
experiments only looked at acute unfractionated dosing, which may
not accurately model the chronic cumulative exposure that would
happen on a Mars mission.
Therefore, in the absence of experiments that can more accu-
rately model the long-term simultaneous exposure to full GCR and
microgravity over several years, and the plausible synergistic impact of
these insults, our results should be taken a conservative glimpse into
the potential dire health consequences of long-term deep space travel.

kidneys and other visceral organs that have received little attention is
of the utmost importance if we are to develop mitigation strategies
and send humans to other planets and beyond.
Methods
Human studies ethical approval
All crews from the Inspiration4, NASA, JAXA spaceﬂights provided
informed written consent prior to their participation.
Inspiration4 subjects were consented at an informed consent
brieﬁng (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected
and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew
members have consented for data and sample sharing. Tissue samples
were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for
research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials.
The procedure followed guidelines set by the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Insti-
tutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols. Experiments were
conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval
of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). NASA IRB
(CSA defers to NASA’s IRB), ESA IRB, JAXA IRB for their respective
crewmembers from Biochemical Proﬁle (NASA IRB Pro0797) and
Nutritional Status Assessment: SMO 016E (pro0326) projects. All crews
provided informed written consent prior to participation.
The JAXA human spaceﬂight study was proposed to and sup-
ported by the 2014 International Life Sciences Research Announce-
ments, JAXA, and NASA. Ethics committee approvals were obtained at
the University of Tsukuba (No. 251, Nov. 27, 2015), JAXA (JX-IRBA-20-
071, Aug. 30, 2016), NASA (Pro1995, Feb. 28, 2017), ESA (2017_04_09,
Apr. 20, 2017). Informed consent was obtained by the personal infor-
mation manager of the study, and de-identiﬁed samples were made
available to researchers who performed sample processing and data
analysis.
Cosmonaut data were obtained from previously published data
[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10517-013-2310-2].
Animal Studies ethical approval
For all animal data coming from NASA Genelab Open Science Data
Repository (see detailed citations for all missions in the supplementary
methods section) the ethical oversight information and protocol
number can be found in the Protocol section (e.g. https://osdr.nasa.
gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-102).

Sex differences
For the human studies: NASA historical data is pooled and anonymised
for ethical reasons.
Cosmonaut and JAXA data is all male. SpaceX data involves both
sexes, but this cannot be disaggregated for ethical reasons of
anonymity.
For the animal studies: The ﬁndings apply mostly female animals
(roughly two thirds of animal missions were female). As we were col-
lecting data from previously conducted experiments, we did not have
the ability to alter this sex disparity. Only one study had both males and
females, which enabled us to perform sex difference analyses for
parameters such as blood and urine electrolytes.
Sample sizes
Due to the nature of our study we used samples from animals that had
been inspaceﬂight (usually as part of the ‘Rodent Research’ missions to
the International Space Station) or had been taken from costly
experiments using the Galactic Cosmic Radiation Simulator at Broo-
khaven national laboratories. We also used samples and/or data from
humans who had undergone spaceﬂight (in historical NASA missions,
Roscosmos missions, and JAXA missions to the ISS or modern com-
mercial missions with SpaceX such as inspiration4). Our sample
numbers were therefore limited to the number of samples made
available to us in the original experimental designs or mission para-
meter limitations (restricted by practical considerations of weight to
launch, available space and resource consumption). In all cases, we
endeavoured to use the maximum number of biological replicates
available to us to maximise experimental power.
Statistics and reproducibility
Omics studies. This study encompassed 2 epigenomic (Whole-gen-
ome bisulﬁte sequencing), 9 transcriptomic (8 Bulk RNA sequencing, 1
Bulk small RNA sequencing), 7 proteomic (3 Quantitative fractionated
TMT-labelled DDA LC-MS/MS, 2 Quantitative label-free SEER DIA LC-
MS/MS, 1 Plasma Slow Off-Rate Modiﬁed Aptamers, 1 Shotgun LC-MS/
MS), 1 epiproteomic (Quantitative fractionated TMT-labelled DDA LC-
MS/MS of phospho-enriched peptides), 3 metabolomic (Quantitative
label-free UHPLC-MS/MS) and 6 metagenomic (4 Whole metagenome
shotgun sequencing, 2 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) studies
on both humans and animals. Full details of the experimental, pro-
cessing and analytical methodologies and locations of publicly avail-
able raw data are given in the supplementary methods.
Physiology
Sample collection and processing. NSRL-22A
Urine collection was performed in awake mice to obtain sponta-
neous and uncontaminated samples. Mice were gently handled over a
sheet of Saran® wrap or Paraﬁlm® to facilitate micturition. Upon col-
lection, each urine sample was carefully divided into two aliquots. One
aliquot was immediately acidiﬁed with HNO3 to achieve a ﬁnal con-
centration of 1% v/v, preventing precipitation of electrolytes and
maintaining sample integrity. Both aliquots were then promptly stored
at −80 °C to preserve their biochemical constituents until further
analysis. For blood collection, mice were subjected to terminal
anaesthesia to minimise distress and ensure compliance with ethical
guidelines. Blood samples were drawn from the vena cava using a ﬁne
needle and syringe. Plasma was separated by transferring the blood
into Microvette® CB 300 LH (Sarstedt) tubes and centrifuging at
2000 g for 5 min. The resulting plasma supernatant was carefully
aspirated and stored at −80 °C for future analysis. Both plasma and
non-acidiﬁed urine samples were analysed for creatinine levels by
employing either the standard Jaffe reaction or the enzymatic method,
depending on the investigator’s preference and laboratory resources.
Electrolyte levels, biochemistries and biomarkers were assessed using
the Siemens Dimension RxL Max Integrated Chemistry System, at the
Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory at Addenbrooke’s Hospital,
Cambridge, UK.
Inspiration4
Plasma samples collected from astronauts at timepoints L-92d,
L-44d and L-3d were grouped and averaged into “pre-ﬂight” for com-
parison against individual post-ﬂight timepoints R + 1d, R + 45d,
R + 82d and R + 194d. These samples were analysed by Quest Diag-
nostics using the Comprehensive metabolic panel [CMP; CPT
code 80053].

NASA
A historical collection of archived astronaut frozen plasma and
urine aliquots were collected and stored at −80 °C over many years.
Clinical chemistries, endocrine proﬁles and biomarkers were obtained
at the Nutritional Biochemistry Laboratory at NASA Johnson Space
Center. Timepoints L-180d and L-45d were grouped and averaged as
“pre-ﬂight” for comparison to individual timepoints L + 15d, L + 30d,
L + 60d, L + 120d, L + 180d, R + 0d and R + 30d.
Functional calculations. Functional calculations used in the data
analysis are fully detailed in the supplementary methods.
Imaging
Sample ﬁxation and processing. Mouse kidney samples were har-
vested and ﬁxed through immersion in freshly prepared 4% (w/v)
formaldehyde-PBS solution (pH 6.9) for 16 h at 37 °C. Subsequently,
the samples were washed three times with PBS with 0.02% Na-Azide
and stored at 4 °C until they were embedded in parafﬁn.
Histopathology and Brightﬁeld WSI. 2-3 µm FFPE sections from
NSRL-22A kidneys were prepared, deparafﬁnised using Histoclear
(National Diagnostics), and rehydrated through a series of graded
methanol steps. These were then stained for either Haematoxylin and
Eosin (#ab245880, Abcam) or Masson’s Trichrome (#ab150686,
Abcam) according to the manufacturers guidelines.
Sections underwent brightﬁeld whole slide imaging with 20X
objective tiled and stitched focus stacks taken for each section on a
Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. The resultant images were viewed in
QuPath (v0.4.3) and semi-quantitatively scored for any histopatholo-
gical ﬁndings.
Immunostaining and confocal WSI. 5 µm FFPE sections from RR-10
kidneys were prepared, deparafﬁnised using Histoclear (National
Diagnostics), and rehydrated through a series of graded methanol
steps. Antigen retrieval was performed using [1X] R-Universal buffer
(AP0530) in a 2100 antigen retriever for a single heat-pressure cycle
(Aptum Biologics). Sections were then permeabilized with 0.05% (v/v)
Triton X-100-PBS solution for 20 minutes and incubated with Section
Block ‘ready-to-use’ (AP0471; Aptum Biologics) for 30 mins at RT. Pri-
mary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C for 16 hours at
speciﬁed concentrations (see supplementary methods), diluted in
Antibody Diluent ‘FF/PE Sections’ (AP0472; Aptum Biologics). For
phospho-speciﬁc antibodies, 10 μg/ml of the non-phospho peptide
used to raise the antibody was added per 2 μg/ml of the antibody used.
Negative control samples omitted the primary antibody and were
processed simultaneously. Following incubation, slides were washed
by dipping slides 50x times in 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100-PBS for 3
rounds, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at RT. Pre-
absorbed ﬂuorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies were uti-
lised at speciﬁed concentrations (concentrations (see supplementary
methods), diluted in Antibody Diluent ‘FF/PE Sections’ (AP0472;
Aptum Biologics). After washing, slides were mounted using Prolong
Gold antifade (#P36930, Life Technologies), permitted to cure for 48-
72hrs, sealed with CoverGrip Coverslip Sealant (#23005; Biotium) and
protected from light exposure.
Immunoﬂuorescent images were captured using either a Zeiss
LSM700 LED laser-scanning confocal microscope or Leica SP8 white-
light laser-scanning confocal microscope using 488-nm, 555-nm and
639-nm laser lines, employing a 10X/0.3NA (Zeiss) or 10X/0.5NA
(Leica) objective. Zeiss acquisition parameters included single ﬁeld of
view, 8-bit resolution, 1844 x 1844 pixels, 1x digital zoom, 3.85µs pixel
dwell time, 4-line Kalman ﬁltering, sequential (by line) channel ima-
ging, and a 4-slice z-stack with a 6 µm thickness to account for chro-
matic aberration.
Leica acquisition parameters included tile scanning with a 10%
overlap, 8-bit resolution, 1024 × 1024 pixels, 0.75x digital zoom,
600 Hz scan speed, 6-line Kalman ﬁltering, sequential (by line) channel
imaging, and a 3-slice z-stack with a 5 µm thickness to account for
chromatic aberration.
Images were processed using FIJI image analysis software
(v.1.53p). Fluorescent z-stacks underwent background subtraction
(200 px radius rolling ball) and maximum intensity z-projection.
Brightness and contrast adjustments were made using linear histo-
gram stretching to enhance visibility.
miRNA in situ hybridisation and brightﬁeld WSI. FFPE blocks for BNL-
3 kidneys were trimmed to remove tissue exposed to air, and fresh
5 µm sections were taken. These were not baked onto the slide and
stored with desiccant instead. Samples were then processed using the
miRNAscope™HD RED assay (#324531 and #324500, ACD-Biotechne)
with the FFPE tissue section workﬂow according to the manufacturers
guidelines. miRNAscope™Probes against the following were used:
mmu-miR-125b-5p (#1082311-S1), mmu-let-7a-5p (#727761-S1) and
mmu-miR-16-5p (729031-S1).
Sections underwent brightﬁeld whole slide imaging with 20X
objective tiled and stitched focus stacks (with extended depth of
focus) taken for each section on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner.
Using QuPath (v0.4.3) the cortex, outer stripe of the outer medulla,
inner stripe of the outer medulla and inner medulla were manually
annotated with the aid of a Wacom cintiq pro 32 to create a segmen-
tation mask of the anatomical regions for area calculation. Ilastik
(v1.4.0)65 automated (supervised) pixel-level classiﬁcation was then
trained to identify positive miRNAscope probe staining. A custom in-
house python script was then used to count all positive staining and
calculate the area of all anatomical regions, so that the density of each
miRNA per unit area of each region could be determined for each
kidney section.
Optical clearing and 3D imaging. Tissue transformation, delipidation
and refractive index matching
Quartered formaldehyde-ﬁxed kidneys from RR-10 mice were
tissue transformed using the SHIELD protocol66 and reagents from
Lifecanvas technologies (MA, USA) based on (10.1038/nbt.4281).
SHIELD-transformed kidneys were delipidated (Lifecanvas Technolo-
gies;
Full
Passive
Pipeline
Protocol
v4.06)
for
approximately
10–14 days at 37 °C in 40 mL of passive delipidation buffer with gentle
agitation in EasyClear device. Following delipidation, tissues were
washed in several rounds of PBS at 37˚C overnight to remove any
delipidation buffer. Before imaging tissues were immersed in Incu-
bated in EasyIndex RI 1.53 refractive index matching solution as per
protocol. Tissues were then embedded in 2% w/v ultra-low melting
point agarose (Sigma A5030) blocks made up with EasyIndex solution
to immobilise the samples. These were then stored in EasyIndex in
airtight containers shielded from light prior to imaging.
MesoSPIM imaging
Samples were mounted in quartz cuvettes and immersion oil with
refractive indices matching that of EasyIndex, and then suspended and
aligned for light-sheet ﬂuorescence imaging with a MesoSPIM67. Ima-
ges were captured at 16-bit for 1-channel dual laser lightsheet illumi-
nation (488 nm excitations) to obtain autoﬂuorescence emissions at
2048 x 2048 pixels in the XY, with a Z depth range of 700-1200 pixels,
giving a pixel resolution of 3.26 μm (XY) and 4.0 μm (Z).
Image analysis
To evaluate any qualitative changes in gross morphology images
were imported into Syglass68 (v.1.7.2-79; https://www.syglass.io/; RRID:
SCR_017961) for visual investigation by nephrologists and histopathol-
ogists in 3D virtual space using Meta Quest 2 VR headsets. Images were
also imported into Imaris69(v10.0) for visualisation on a Wacom cintiq

pro 32” 4 K touchscreen monitor. 3D video renders were later generated
with Syglass (v.2.0.0) and Z-slice video created with FIJI (ImageJ; v.1.54 h).
Morphometry
Normalised kidney weights. PI and NASA GeneLab records for all
animals included in the study were examined for bodyweight and
kidney wet weight measurements. Only BNL-1, BNL-2, BNL-3 and RR-23
missions had complete kidney and body weight information available.
Where available, the weights of both left and right kidneys were
averaged, and the kidney weights were normalised against bodyweight
for the same animal and expressed as a percentage. All ground control
and sham animals that received no exposure treatment were grouped
into control for pairwise comparisons against GCR (animals that only
received either full or simpliﬁed galactic cosmic radiation simulations)
or MG (animals that only underwent hindlimb unloading microgravity
simulation) or GCR + MG (animals that underwent a combination of
GCR and MG or were exposed to spaceﬂight).
Histomorphometry. Whole slide images of tiled immunoﬂuorescent
confocal images taken from RR-10 were used for analysis. Using
QuPath (v0.4.3) the cortex was manually annotated with the aid of a
Wacom cintiq pro 32 to create a segmentation mask of the anatomical
region for area calculation. Similarly distal convoluted tubules (DCT)
labelled with antibodies against total NCC / phospho-NCC (see sup-
plementary methods for details), the canonical DCT marker, were
annotated. Initially, only a handful of tubules were annotated from
each slide, and these were then used to train Ilastik (v1.4.0)65 for
automated (supervised) pixel-level classiﬁcation of DCTs. These were
then further manually reﬁned to remove/include any false-positive/
negatives. A custom in-house python script was then used to compute
the number of discrete tubules positive for DCT markers, the corre-
sponding area of each of these as well as the total cortex area, such that
average tubule area and DCT density per area of cortex could be
determined for each kidney section.
