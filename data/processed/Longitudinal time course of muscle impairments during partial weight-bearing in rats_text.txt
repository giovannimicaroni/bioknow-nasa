In the near future, space agencies plan to send the ﬁrst crews for extended stays on the Moon and Mars, where gravity is
signiﬁcantly reduced compared to Earth (0.16×g and 0.38×g, respectively). However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have
not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a
quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle
function at three different PWB levels. We demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are signiﬁcantly impaired in
reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are
correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the
need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration.

INTRODUCTION
By providing a sustained mechanical load, gravity is crucial for the
maintenance and health of the musculoskeletal system. Micro-
gravity, accordingly, markedly alters musculoskeletal physiology.1–3
For example, the soleus mass decreases by over 30% after 3 weeks
in microgravity,4 and femoral bone strength declines by ~2% for
every 100 days in space.5,6 But the most important consequences
lie in the risks encountered when astronauts return to Earth and
are subjected to standard gravity; indeed, the dramatic decrease
in muscle size, strength, and endurance7 produces long-term
consequences including chronic muscle fatigue and persistent low
back pain.8,9
While considerable information has been gathered concerning
the physiological adaptations of the human body to weightless-
ness,10,11 long-term studies are rare and longitudinal assessments
remain limited due to the difﬁculty to obtain muscle biopsy data
on astronauts in-ﬂight. For this reason, researchers have relied on
several animal models, most notably the rat hindlimb unloading
(HLU) protocol developed in 1979 by Morey et al. which has been
established as the standard approach12,13 for ground-based
research. However, this model puts considerable stress on the
rat tail, which can lead to blood ﬂow restriction, inﬂammation, and
necrosis. More importantly, the HLU model is not suitable to
investigate the effects of partial gravity that will be encountered
when astronauts reach extra-terrestrial targets such as Mars (38%
of Earth gravity, or 0.38×g) and the Moon (16% of Earth gravity, or
0.16×g), or when they are exposed to artiﬁcial gravity induced by
continuous centrifugation.14 An innovative partial weight-bearing
(PWB) model, incorporating a tail-suspension and body harness,
has been developed in mice, allowing normal activity for up to
3 weeks at several different levels of PWB.15,16 However, rats are
generally considered a better animal model for spaceﬂight studies
since their physiological processes, including drug metabolism,
are
considered
more
analogous
to
those
of
humans.17
Accordingly, we recently modiﬁed this mouse PWB model for
rats18 by substituting a pelvic harness for the tail suspension,
thereby providing a less stressful experience with improved
reliability.
In the present study, we sought to extend our initial18 work for
up to 4 weeks and assessed the functional muscle alterations that
occur in three different PWB levels (70%, 40%, and 20% of normal
loading). Additionally, we harvested muscle tissues on days 7, 14,
and 28 to obtain a comprehensive timeline of muscle atrophy at
these different levels of PWB. By doing so, we can provide a
detailed picture of the muscle alterations induced by a reduction
of the mechanical load. This longitudinal study provides the ﬁrst
step for better understanding the impact of space missions in
which stays on the Moon and Mars are planned.
RESULTS
The consistency of the PWB level achieved was high (Fig. 1a).
Indeed, all unloaded
groups displayed
minimal differences
between their achieved and desired PWB level, which was further
demonstrated by low coefﬁcients of variation (PWB70: 0.54%,
PWB40: 1.20%, PWB20: 0.95%). Actual body mass without the
harness was recorded weekly (Fig. 1b), and at all time-points, PWB
animals displayed a signiﬁcantly different body mass change
compared to the normal loading (PWB100) controls. Despite
exhibiting a transient and signiﬁcant loss of body mass in the ﬁrst
14 days, all groups reached a body mass signiﬁcantly above their
baseline but lower than the PWB100 control rats after 28 days of
suspension.
Calf circumference (Fig. 2) steadily increased over time in the
control (PWB100) group, while it decreased signiﬁcantly during
the ﬁrst 2 weeks in all PWB groups compared to their baseline (Fig.
2a). After 28 days of suspension, all animals displayed a calf
circumference greater than their baseline, but control group

values remained signiﬁcantly higher than all other values. From 1-
week onward, all PWB groups displayed a signiﬁcantly lower grip
force compared both to the controls (PWB100) and their
respective baseline values (Fig. 2b).
Nerve-stimulated plantar ﬂexion force was measured only on
days 0 and 28 (Fig. 2c). The control animals (PWB100) showed an
increase in their area under curve (AUC) after 4 weeks (+5.1 mN s),
which was signiﬁcantly greater than in all the other PWB groups.
Each unloaded group displayed a reduction of the AUC in a dose-
dependent manner after 28 days of suspension, ranging from
−2.7 mN s for the PWB70 groups and −5.9 mN s for the PWB40
group, to −6.7 mN.s for the PWB20 animals. This dose-dependent
decrease over a 1-month period was assessed by performing a
linear regression
among the groups (R2 = 0.98,
p < 0.0001).
Additionally, the maximal impulse recorded at 28 days of
suspension can be normalized by the combined wet mass of
the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (triceps surae) in order to
determine muscle quality (Supplementary Table 1). This parameter
highlighted the linear correlation (p = 0.043 using a one-way
ANOVA followed by a post hoc test for trend) between the
different groups, ranging from 9.87 ± 1.64 mN s g−1 for the control
group to 6.14 ± 1.25 mN s g−1 for the rats exposed to PWB20,
suggesting a reduction in the intrinsic force generating capability
of the muscle due to PWB.
At each time point (i.e., 7, 14, and 28 days) hind limb muscles
were dissected and wet mass was recorded (Fig. 3). After 7 days,
the PWB20 group showed a signiﬁcant reduction in soleus mass
compared to controls (−14.89 ± 2.87%, p < 0.05); PWB70 and
PWB40 animals displayed substantial but non-signiﬁcant reduc-
tions (−10.24 ± 3.20% and −8.54 ± 3.35%, respectively, Fig. 3a).
After 14 days, all unloaded groups had a signiﬁcantly lower soleus
mass as compared to the PWB100 controls in a dose-dependent
fashion. This ﬁnding remained observable at 28 days for the
PWB20 and PWB40 groups but not for the PWB70 group despite a
mean reduction of −9.53 ± 2.96% (p = 0.11, using a two-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test).
In contrast, the mass of the gastrocnemius muscle did not differ
signiﬁcantly for any PWB group as compared to PWB100 control
animals for the ﬁrst 2 weeks of the experiment (Fig. 3b). However,
after 28 days of partial unloading, the animals exposed to PWB40
displayed signiﬁcant muscle atrophy compared to the PWB100
controls (−11.14 ± 2.41%, p = 0.013, using a two-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s post hoc test), as did the animals exposed to
PWB20 (−9.00 ± 4.27%, p < 0.05). On day 7, quadriceps femoris
wet mass (Fig. 3c) was signiﬁcantly reduced only in the PWB20
group compared to the controls (−10.69 ± 1.66%, p < 0.05, using a
two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test). On days 14
and 28, all experimental groups displayed signiﬁcant quadriceps
atrophy compared to the controls at PWB100 in a clear dose-
dependent fashion.
Using
quantitative
histomorphometry,
we
measured
the
average cross-sectional area (CSA) of the myoﬁbers in both soleus
(Fig. 4a) and gastrocnemius (Fig. 4b) muscles, which have been
extensively studied for their adaptation to microgravity. In both
muscles and under all reduced PWB conditions and time points,
i.e., 7 days (Fig. 4c), 14 days (Fig. 4d), and 28 days (Fig. 4e), the
unloaded groups displayed a signiﬁcantly smaller myoﬁber CSA
than the PWB100 controls. Moreover, myoﬁber atrophy followed a
signiﬁcant linear trend across groups plotted against their degree
of PWB (R2 values for the soleus are: 0.79, 0.89, and 0.83 for 7, 14,
and 28 days, respectively. R2 values for the gastrocnemius are:
0.39, 0.97, and 0.99 for 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively).
Additionally, we observed a ﬁber type switch in these two
muscles of the unloaded rats compared to the PWB100 controls
(Supplementary Table 2). While accounting for only approximately
40% of the soleus myoﬁbers in mice,19 type 1 ﬁbers (i.e., slow-
twitch, oxidative) normally comprise from 80 to 94% of the
myoﬁbers in the soleus muscle in humans and in rats20,21 We
observed a similar percentage of type 1 myoﬁbers in the soleus
muscle in our control PWB100 group, ranging from 90.96 ± 1.25%
to 88.68 ± 1.81% between the different time points. In contrast,
the number of type 1 ﬁbers decreased (and presumably the
number of type 2 ﬁbers (i.e., fast-twitch, glycolytic) increased) in
the soleus muscle with decreasing PWB level. For example, after
14 days of suspension, the percentage of type 1 ﬁbers decreased
in the soleus to 85.32 ± 2.65% for the rats at PWB70, 78.51 ± 2.07%
at PWB40, and 84.08 ± 2.13% at PWB20. The opposite trend was
observed in the gastrocnemius muscle, which is composed
predominantly of type 2 ﬁbers in normal conditions (PWB100)
and displayed an increasingly higher percentage of type 1 ﬁbers in
the increasingly unloaded groups. The ﬁber-type switch that we
observed has been reported previously in the literature,22,23 and
has been described as a preferential atrophy according to muscle
location and ﬁber-type. The extent of ﬁber-type switching
increases with time (p = 0.0019, using a two-way ANOVA followed
by Tukey’s post hoc test) and reduction in PWB level (p = 0.0484,
using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test).
However, although we visually observed a consistent trend in
ﬁber-type switching in the gastrocnemius, we did not detect
statistically signiﬁcant differences between PWB groups in this
muscle.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that our PWB model in rats shows
excellent reliability and is effective in modeling the impact of

reduced mechanical loading on muscle health, with several
muscle parameters presenting dose-dependent alterations. The
multiple time points allowed us to observe alterations in muscle
function and mass as early as 7 days after exposure to reduced
loading that appeared to become greater over time (Fig. 2b). The
early muscle deﬁcits that we observed here using our recently
developed PWB model18,24 and are well described in the hindlimb
unloading literature25–27 emphasize the need for mitigating
strategies immediately after a reduction, even partial, in mechan-
ical loading. Muscle impairment was further conﬁrmed with the
dose-dependent diminution in both the maximal torque obtained
after a tetanic stimulation of the tibial nerve on day 28 (Fig. 2c),
and the normalized tetanic impulse values at 28 days (Supple-
mentary Table 1), therefore stressing the intrinsic loss of muscle
function that correlated with reduced load. These physiological
changes were also conﬁrmed by the reduced hindlimb muscle
mass (Fig. 3) and were associated with a reduction in myoﬁber
cross sectional area (Fig. 4). These data are analogous to those
previously observed after 21 days of PWB in mice.15,16 For
example, when exposed to PWB20, soleus and gastrocnemius
mass were reduced by 22% and 10%, respectively, compared to
the control animals. Furthermore, similar to our ﬁndings, this
previous work reported that the loss of muscle mass was dose-
dependent and correlated to the PWB levels.
As in prior human and animal studies, both in space or using
ground-based analogues,4 we observed that the soleus muscle
atrophied to a much greater extent than the gastrocnemius with a
signiﬁcant
decrease
in
type

ﬁbers
(Supplementary Table 2). Based on this immunostaining, we
assumed that this was correlated to an increase in the proportion
of fast-twitch glycolytic myoﬁbers; however, this assumption
should be conﬁrmed in future work by speciﬁcally staining for fast-
twitch ﬁbers, which we did not do. This effect on muscle
composition has been extensively studied in the context of
microgravity1,28,29 although the changes do not always reach
statistical signiﬁcance.30,31 However, the non-signiﬁcant trend we
observed in the gastrocnemius (i.e., a visible increase in slow-
twitch ﬁbers as seen in Fig. 4b), which is a mixed-ﬁber type
muscle, has only been described in the context of neuromuscular
disorders such as spinal bulbar muscular atrophy.32 In this
disorder, the cellular shift often precedes symptoms including
muscle atrophy, and is thought to be caused by a metabolic
dysfunction. Indeed, in this pathology, early changes in gene
expression seem to be responsible for the alteration of the
glycolysis process, which in return, is contributing to the myoﬁber
type shift by modifying skeletal muscle metabolism and substrate
availability. Analogously, prediabetic and metabolic symptoms
such as insulin resistance are often experienced by astronauts
during their missions.33,34 Thus, it would be interesting to further
investigate the metabolic changes that are induced in our model,
including skeletal muscle insulin-resistance, mitochondrial respira-
tion and overall energy homeostasis, to determine if these
mechanisms, which are known to impact the muscle tissue,
contribute to the shift in myoﬁber type or are a consequence of it.
Our future studies based on RNA sequencing, and aiming at
unraveling the modulation of gene expression during PWB, will
need to assess these additional parameters to better understand
the underlying mechanisms.
Our PWB model offers the possibility of assessing the time-
course of the musculoskeletal alterations across the spectrum of
mechanical loading to better understand the underlying mechan-
isms of muscle loss and performance deﬁcits. Muscle force, and
therefore function, is a critical aspect of the astronaut health since
it is essential for the efﬁcient performance of a wide range of tasks.

represent a major impairment after landing, when astronauts are
suddenly re-exposed to gravity. Interestingly, our results highlight
that even a 30% decrease in mechanical loading (i.e., PWB70)
induces substantial reductions in muscle force and size that do not
recover after a month of suspension (Fig. 2c). The effects of partial
gravity, as would be experienced by astronauts visiting Mars or
the Moon or via centrifugation-induced artiﬁcial gravity, are far
less studied than the effects of complete weightlessness due to
the prior lack of established animal and human models. The
ground-based PWB model we developed will allow for further
investigation of the potential health impacts of partial mechanical
unloading and could represent the ﬁrst step toward ﬁnding
solutions
to
protect
astronauts
during
long-duration
space
missions.
While successful, there remain several limitations to this model.
First, we observed an initial transient decline in body mass; and
although within an acceptable range (i.e., <10% of the initial body
mass), as it is experienced in all ground-based models as well as in
astronauts themselves,35–38 this body mass loss can create some
bias in non-invasive assessments such as limb girth. Second, unlike
humans, rats display constant growth, which also involves the
musculoskeletal system. Indeed, the increase in muscle wet mass
and in the average myoﬁber cross-sectional area was visible in our
cohort of fully-loaded (PWB100) controls between different time-
points. However, it has been described that after the initial and
rapid growth period, male rats grow at a constant rate between 10
and 30 weeks old before showing signs of aging,39 thus
conﬁrming our choice in using 14–18-week-old animals.
Another limitation of this work is that we did not attempt to
quantify nocturnal or daytime behavior. However, in order to get
some sense of their overall behavior, video monitoring was
installed within the animal facility and qualitative differences in
behavior among groups were not observed. Despite being
quadrupedal animals, rats brieﬂy but regularly display some
bipedal
behavior,
mainly
occurring
during
environmental
exploration and feeding, and such bipedal behavior was visible
in all groups. While not noticeably greater in the reduced PWB
groups, these brief bipedal occurrences represent a change in the
animals’ unloading status that was not preventable. Moreover,
due to their quadrupedal locomotion, many factors diverge
between humans and rats, and this model cannot account for
all such differences. Additionally, we also did not obtain a
continuous measure of ground reaction forces. This should
certainly be considered for future work. Finally, we have not fully
characterized the stress levels in our animals. While our behavioral
assessments, including food intake, grooming, and physical
assessments were helpful and are widely used to identify whether
animals are under stress, it will be necessary to sample blood and/
or
feces
at
different
time
points
to
assess
the
level
of
corticosterone for an accurate measurement of the animals’ stress.
This model has a number of potential uses beyond simply
providing a ground-based analogue for different levels of partial
unloading. First, it can serve as a testing ground for studies of
therapeutic agents or exercise countermeasures in partial unload-
ing.40 This is especially true since, if needed, it is extremely easy to
remove the animals from the PWB harness for short periods of time
to administer medications by injection or perform other assess-
ments. Similarly, for exercise countermeasures, the model allows for
relatively normal positioning and thus it would be possible, for
example, to outﬁt a cage with a treadmill apparatus, allowing
animals to perform in normal or reduced loading conditions.
Likewise, by incorporating other hazardous events that occur during
space ﬂight, such as radiation exposure, the model could also
address the impact of the combined effects of PWB and radiation
exposure to muscle health.41,42 Moreover, the model could be used
as a tool to assess the impact of sequentially altering loading levels.
For example, a fully hind-limb suspended rat could then be placed
in PWB40, so as to mimic an astronaut traveling from Earth to Mars
and then landing on Mars, assessing the effect of partial unloading
on an already compromised musculoskeletal system.24 Alternatively,

the model could be used to assess the impact of the gradual
mechanical
reloading,
via
the
progressive
reintroduction
of
increased PWB, as means of re-acclimating safely to full Earth
gravity after an extended period in space.
In summary, we developed a PWB for rats capable of simulating
various mechanical loading environments while maintaining a
quadrupedal stance. This model, ﬁrst developed to investigate the
impact of reduced weight-bearing environments observed at extra-
terrestrial targets such as the Moon or Mars, additionally brings
valuable insights about the potential mitigating effects of applying
artiﬁcial gravity during spaceﬂight to preserve muscle health.
METHODS
Animals
Wistar male rats, n = 149, (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA,
USA) weighing a mean ± standard error of 408 ± 0.15 g (14 weeks of age)
were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22 ± range of 2 °C)
room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. Water and rat chow were provided
ad libitum and monitored daily. Rats were regularly assessed for any signs
of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyric staining around the eyes, poor
grooming, and hair loss), harness and jacket ﬁtting, ability to walk and
move across the cage, food and water intake. Additionally, fully loaded and
partially loaded mass measurements were recorded daily. All experimental

protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
For all experiments requiring anesthesia, vaporized isoﬂurane (1.5–3.5%)
+ oxygen was used and body temperature was maintained using a water-
blanket (Gaymar, Inc., Orchard Park, NY) set at 37 °C (Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Hampton, NH, USA). At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by CO2
inhalation and hind limb muscles were harvested and weighed on a
precision analytical balance (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA).
PWB suspension model
Animals were placed in four different groups: normal loading (PWB100, n =
38), 70% of normal loading (PWB70, n = 36), 40% of normal loading (PWB40,
n = 36), and 20% of normal loading (PWB20, n = 39). In each group, 12
animals were euthanized on day 7 and day 14 for ex vivo tissue analysis. On
day 28, 12–15 animals per group were euthanized. At the beginning of the
study, rats were distributed to ensure a balanced distribution of the body
weights across all groups. Forty-eight hours prior to day 0 (baseline)
assessment, rats were placed in custom cages and jackets for acclimation.
Beginning on day 0, and after obtaining the pre-suspension measurements,
animals were subjected to either normal loading (PWB100) or other PWB
levels using the model designed in our previous work.18 Brieﬂy, rats were
secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness and submitted to a 2-point
suspension allowing them to maintain quadrupedal behavior while
weighing 100, 70, 40, or 20% of their initial body weight. Animals were
weighed daily and if necessary the PWB apparatus was adjusted to ensure
that their achieved unloading level remained constant within a 5% margin
error of their desired PWB level, by modulating the chain length of the
suspension device. Rats were positioned over a digital animal scale (ZIEIS,
Lakeville, MN, USA) and their mass at PWB100, including the mass of the
suspension device, was recorded. Then, the “unloaded” mass was obtained
and the recorded level of PWB was calculated every morning by using the
ratio of these two measurements.
Calf circumference
Under isoﬂurane anesthesia, animals were placed in a prone position with
the left hind limb positioned at a 45° angle to the spine. The left leg was
shaved using a hair clipper (Braintree Scientiﬁc, Braintree, MA, USA), and
three measurements of the calf circumference were obtained at the tibial
mid-shaft using a suture thread at baseline and after 7, 14, and 28 days of
suspension. Each thread was then measured with a micrometer (Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Hampton, NH, USA) and the average of the three measurements
was recorded.
Rear paw grip force
Rats rear paws were placed on a 50 N capacity digital grip force meter
(Chatillon, Largo, FL, USA) and gently pulled backward until the animal
released its grip. The peak force generated was measured by a force
transducer linked to the bar. Three tests were performed with a short rest
period of at least 30 s between each trial, and averaged. Results were
expressed as the percentage of each animal’s grip force measured at
baseline (i.e., pre-suspension).
Foot plate plantar force generation
Under anesthesia, rats were placed on a force plate (Dual Mode Muscle
Lever System, Aurora Scientiﬁc, Aurora, ON, Canada), and their left foot was
securely taped on the foot plate. Monopolar electrodes (28 G, Natus
Medical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA, USA) were used to deliver a tetanic,
supramaxial stimulation of the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa at a
frequency of 200 Hz, for 200 ms. The maximal torque response was
recorded and the AUC was calculated.
Muscle histomorphometry
After euthanasia, the left gastrocnemius, soleus, and quadriceps femoris
muscles were harvested and the wet mass of each muscle was determined
using a precision analytical balance. The soleus and gastrocnemius muscles
were then placed in 10% buffered formalin and ﬁxed for 48 h (histological
analysis was not performed on quadriceps femoris). Samples were
embedded in parafﬁn blocks, sectioned into 10 micron slices and double
immunoﬂuorescence staining was performed using anti-collagen VI
antibody (ab6588, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-slow skeletal
myosin heavy chain antibody (ab11083, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).
Stained slides were subsequently imaged at 20× using a Zeiss Axio Imager
M1 epiﬂuorescence microscope and ﬁber area was measured using the
muscle morphometry plug-in (Anthony Sinadinos using Eclipse IDE) and
FIJI (FIJI, ImageJ, NIH) with examiners blinded to PWB level and duration.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with Graphpad Prism 7.2 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla,
CA) using one-way ANOVA for terminal measurements, followed by
Tukey’s post hoc test or the linear test for trend. Longitudinal data were
analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Results
are presented as mean ± SEM and considered signiﬁcant when p < 0.05.
