Abstract: Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during
prolonged spaceﬂight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunc-
tion, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are
observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we
saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model
overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling
in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the
effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to ﬁnd the underlying molecular mechanisms
that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in
the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb
unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT
ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker
following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally,
we identiﬁed cytokines in the hippocampus, which had signiﬁcant positive correlations with CD68
and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinﬂammation
and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes
could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for
the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle
disuse on Earth.

1. Introduction
Bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and isolation have negative effects on almost all systems
of the human body, and understanding these effects has become a primary objective for
enabling long-term space ﬂights. Exposure to microgravity is associated with skeletal
muscle atrophy, but it might also have detrimental effects on the central nervous system

(CNS) and cognition, since spaceﬂight results in signiﬁcant volumetric changes in brain
grey matter [1]. Furthermore, simulated microgravity in mice induced impairments in
immune functions [2]. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, are crucial for
maintaining a healthy neural environment promoting homeostasis and responding to
infection, or injury. Microglial activation can occur in response to a variety of triggers and
is dependent on the type of pathological stressor or event [3]. Once activated, microglia
not only primarily act as scavenger cells, removing debris and dying neurons [4], but also
perform tissue repair and neural regeneration [5]. Microglia also act as second messengers
by releasing a number of substances such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4,6]. Prolonged activations can lead to neuronal damage or
death, as well as the activation of astrocytes, resulting in further endangerment to neurons
and the further recruitment of microglia, thereby perpetuating the inﬂammatory state [7,8].
There are a number of potentially useful markers for speciﬁc microglia states [9]. Cluster of
Differentiation 68 (CD68) is a lysosomal protein expressed at low levels by resting microglia
and at high levels by activated phagocytic microglia [7,10,11]. CD68 is commonly used to
visualize activated microglia in inﬂammatory responses in the brain and is potentially a
suitable candidate for further exploring microgravity-induced microglial activation.
Studies have shown that microgravity and bedrest stimulate changes in immune
cell response. Monocytes isolated from astronauts exhibit impaired function (reviewed
in [12]). Furthermore, plasma concentrations of TNFα, IL-8, IL-1a, growth factors, and
leukocyte recruitment chemokines have been observed to be increased in plasma following
spaceﬂights [13]. Following the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), the monocyte
secretion of IL-6, TNFα, and IL-10 signiﬁcantly reduced, while IL-1β was elevated post-
ﬂight [14]. During spaceﬂight, increased white blood cell count and decreased T cell
function have been observed in astronaut crews [15]. Studies using blood collected from
human bedrest models of head-down tilt-simulating headward ﬂuid shifts in ﬂight found
changes in immune cells [16] and cytokine levels. After two-week hindlimb unloading
(HU), a rodent model commonly used to simulate weightlessness, microgravity-induced
cephalic ﬂuid shifts, bedrest and anhedonia, the mRNA expression of numerous genes
impacting immune response, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory was altered in
mouse brains [17]. HU also increased microglia activations in spinal cord [18] and neural
stem cells [19]. We previously observed an increase in IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17 in
the hippocampus after prolonged HU [20], cytokines that are known to be produced and
secreted by activated microglia [8,21], and astrocytes [22,23]. Altered gravity was also
observed to downregulate ICAM-1 expression in vitro in murine BV-2 microglial cells,
while a subtype of smaller cells of BV-2 microglial cells appeared and was assumed to be
activated cells [24]. Overall, previous studies showed that microgravity and bedrest both
induced immune response in the CNS, but the microglial activations in the hippocampus
in in vivo mouse models have not yet been investigated. We hypothesized that head-tilt
bedrest will result in microglial activations in the hippocampus.
It has been established that spaceﬂight and spaceﬂight-like stressors cause oxidative
stress responses within the hippocampus [25]. Due to the incomplete mitochondrial metabo-
lization of oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl are generated. Behavioral
and cognitive changes were associated with altered measures of oxidative stress, lipid perox-
idation, and protein and DNA oxidation in the amygdala and hippocampus, brain regions
implicated in anxiety and spatial memory [26]. The increased production of mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to increased cytokine release from microglial cells, po-
tentially indicating increased microglial activations [27,28]. Mitochondrial ROS is generated
by activated microglia [29,30], and reducing its production is believed to be a suitable target
to prevent the over-activation of microglia [27,28,31]. A mouse model for mitochondrial
ROS quenching via the overexpression of the human catalase gene targeted toward the
mitochondria (MCAT) has been previously utilized to investigate oxidative stress. MCAT
mice have increased lifespan [32], improved age-dependent pathologies [33], reduced
radiation-induced neurogenesis depletion [34], cognitive dysfunction, improved outcomes

in models of neurological conditions including ataxia-telangiectasia [35], ALS [36], and
Alzheimer’s disease [37]. MCAT mice also exhibit improved hippocampal spatial learning
and contextual fear memory [26]. Previously, we showed that MCAT mice were protected
from simulated microgravity-induced increases in cytokine expression in hippocampus. In
our lab, in the MCAT mice, ROS quenching was demonstrated by measuring 4-HNE [38,39],
catalase activity, and lipid peroxidation. We have also seen a strong genotype effect in the
MCAT mice, with a signiﬁcantly lower protein abundance of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
in the hippocampus. In a screen of forty-four cytokines and chemokines, fourteen (IFNγ,
IL-4, IL-6,IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17, MCP-1, MCSF, RANTES, MCP-5, and IP-10) were down-
regulated in MCAT vs. WT mice [20]. These results suggest that the increased expression of
these cytokines in wildtype hindlimb-unloaded mice is indictive of microglial activations
and that mitochondrial ROS play an important role in microglial activation; thus, in this
study, we used the MCAT mouse model to see if ROS quenching will mitigate HU-induced
microglial activation.
Understanding the correlations between molecular changes in the brain, behavior,
and plasma markers could reﬁne our understanding of the kinetics of neurodegenerative
changes and help ﬁnd early biomarkers before irreversible damage occurs. Increased
cytokine expression and neuroinﬂammation are associated with changes in behavior. There
is evidence that inﬂammatory factors TNFα and IL-1β are associated with increased sick
behaviors [40–42]. Theses cytokines have also been implicated in anorexic-like behavior [43].
IFNα is known to induce depression in humans [44], and TNFα is involved in depressive-
like behavior as well [45]. In a mouse model, HU resulted in anxiety-like behaviors,
which were associated with signiﬁcant changes in the pattern of neural oscillations in the
hippocampus [46]. Oxidative stress enhanced this response, and the inhibition of ROS
reduced HU-induced anxiety [47].
We previously reported signiﬁcantly reduced CD4+ T cell numbers and elevation
in twelve cytokines in singly, but not socially, housed mice under normal loading condi-
tions [48]. Singly housed mice exposed to simulated microgravity downregulated only one
cytokine, IL-13, which is involved in anti-inﬂammatory mechanisms, and these changes
were mitigated in the MCAT mouse model [20]. These data suggest that, under these
conditions, social isolation and HU may reﬂect an epistatic interaction. In this study, we
investigated the role of HU alone, without the additional isolation effect, in socially housed
animals. MCAT mice were utilized to explore the association between oxidative stress
and microglia activation in simulated microgravity. Correlations between microglia acti-
vation, cytokine expression and behavior were calculated to further our understanding
of the effects of altered gravity on the CNS. In this study, we aim to determine the role
of microglia, ROS pathways, and behavior, following head-tilt bedrest to elucidate the
underlying molecular mechanism behind neuroimmune changes, thus paving the way for
future therapies. We hypothesize that head-tilt bedrest will affect microglia activation in the
hippocampus and that, in the MCAT model, quenching ROS will mitigate these changes.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals and Strains
In this study, a subset of the socially housed (2 per cage) sixteen-week-old female wild
type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice was utilized as described in [20] and [48]. Wild
type (WT) and MCAT mice were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by cross-
ing male MCAT mice, B6. Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033 Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ
mice (from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Genotyping was performed using
the Red’N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore-Sigma, The
Woodlands, TX, USA). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC NAS-16-007-Y2) at
NASA Ames Research Center (ARC).

2.2. Hindlimb Unloading to Produce Head-Down Tilt
Mice were assigned to one of four experimental groups (See Supplementary Figure S1;
n = 8/group unless otherwise stated) and housed in a custom caging system as previously
described [48]. In accordance with our previous work and with most space rodent studies
to date, we chose females for this study. Socially housed, normally loaded (NL) controls
were maintained in standard vivarium cages. All HU groups were acclimated for three
days in HU cages prior to the onset of HU. Room temperature was maintained at a range
of 23–24 ◦C with a 12 h light: dark cycle (6 AM:6 PM lights on:off). Food and water were
provided ad libitum. Nestlets (Ancare, NY, USA) were provided for enrichment. Animal
weights and food consumption were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment.
Animals were euthanized 30 days after the start of HU via CO2 inhalation followed by
cervical dislocation.
2.3. Sample Collection and Immunohistochemistry
The left-brain hemisphere was ﬂash frozen and a tissue biopsy (1.20 mm Harris micro
punch) from the hippocampus was performed inside a cryotome chamber set at −20 ◦C
to avoid thawing. Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized in a mild lysis buffer (Tris
50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Igepal 1%, Protease Inhibitors (Millipore-Sigma, The Woodlands, TX,
USA) [49]. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 ◦C at 1000× g for 10 min and supernatants
were aliquoted and ﬂash frozen at −80 ◦C until analysis.
Cytokine protein abundance in hippocampal homogenates was analyzed using a Mouse
Cytokine/Chemokine Array 44-Plex-MD44 (EVE Technologies, Calgary, AB, Canada) in
which concentration standards are run for each cytokine. To verify the Multiplex method,
IL-3 cytokine expression was validated by ELISA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, Cat# ab113345-
IL-3). Hippocampal cytokine levels were normalized to total protein content as determined
by a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 23225). Blood was collected from
the vena cava immediately after euthanasia. Undiluted plasma was analyzed for cytokine
protein abundance as described for hippocampal homogenates. The results and raw data of
plasma and hippocampal cytokines are shown in Rubinstein et al., 2021 [20], and used here
for correlations.
The right brain hemisphere was embedded in 4% PFA overnight and transferred the
next day into 30% sucrose-PBS solution for cryoprotection. After sucrose impregnation,
brains were embedded in OCT (OCT compound 4583, Sakura, Nagano, Japan) and frozen
at −80 ◦C until cryosectioning. The brains were sectioned in a cryostat at 40 microns
and stained for CD68. Slide-mounted sections were 1x-TBS-buffered at a pH of 7.3 and
washed in H2O2 for antigen unmasking. Next, the primary antibody, rat-αmouse CD68
(Abcam ab53444, dilution 1:2000), was introduced in blocking-buffered 3% Normal Rabbit
Serum After additional TBS washes, the secondary antibody was introduced (biotinylated
rabbit-αrat, dilution 1:200 (Vector BA4001) in blocking-buffered 3% Normal Rabbit Serum).
Ampliﬁcation and ﬂuorescent staining were performed with a Fluorescein Tyramide System
(Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA, NEL701A001KT), as described by the manufacturer. The
indiscriminate nuclear staining agent 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Labs,
Mowry Ave Newark, CA, USA Vectashield, H-1200-10) was used to identify hippocampal
regions, and the Allen Brain Atlas was used for reference (http://mouse.brain-map.org/)
We chose to analyze 4 brains from each group except NL MCAT group in which 5 brains
were analyzed, all with representative sections across the entire hippocampus (CA1/2, CA3
and dentate gyrus (DG)). We used 20X magniﬁcation, and 9–15 photos per hippocampus
were taken. The unbiased microglia counting in each photo was performed manually
counting microglia in each frame, using Image J program (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
2.4. Mouse Behavioral Analysis
Video surveillance: A commercially available surveillance system that allows for both
day and night image captures was utilized. The Lorex 4K UHD 8-channel Fusion NVR
Security System with 8 “Smart Deterrence” 4K Cameras was utilized. This cage system

Life 2022, 12, 1838
5 of 15
was designed to not disturb ongoing behavior. The camera was placed horizontally to the
cage, and it is afﬁxed to a surface at a distance enabling visibility and the capture of full
ambulatory motion and all species’ typical behaviors.
Video Sampling: Mice were recorded in their home cage continuously for a 24 h
period, and samples of 15 min videos were analyzed using Excel to manually score the
duration of various behaviors; time samples were at least 2 h away from the light-to-dark
and dark-to-light transitions to ensure the acquisition of stable activity levels during each
phase of the diurnal cycle.
We sampled 15 min from the following time points: 8 AM, 11:30 AM, 4 PM, 10 PM,
12 AM, 2 AM, and 4 AM. Each behavior graph represents the percentage of time the animal
spent in engaging in a speciﬁc category from the total time measured.
Videos images were manually scored in Excel and analyzed for a range of typical
mouse behaviors that would indicate normal functioning. To obtain a more general behav-
ioral proﬁle, behaviors were pooled into the following categories: “exploratory”, “social
interaction”, “active”, and “rest/sleep”:
1.
Exploratory Behavior: burrowing in bedding, climbing, exploratory snifﬁng, and
exploratory ambulation;
2.
Social Interaction: chasing, snifﬁng another mouse, allogrooming, nestlet social en-
gagement, mounting, socializing with another mouse, and pulling another mouse.
3.
Active Behavior: active behavior contains exploratory behavior, eating, drinking, sniffing,
nestlet manipulation, self-grooming, ambulation, and all social interaction behaviors;
4.
Rest/Sleep: rest/Sleep behavior contains sleep and non-directed movement.
2.5. Behavioral Categories Deﬁnitions
Eating: Mouth is on food. Mouse has visible food in its forepaws and is using its
mouth to interact with food piece. Drinking: The animal rears up and licks the nozzle of
the drinker. Borrowing: Burrowing in its bedding, which involves the paws and snout
and exploring different cage parts. Chasing: Normally loaded animals only. Movement 3
or more steps towards the other mouse, while the other mouse is moving away. Inactive:
Stationary in one spot with most of its body not moving. Climbing: Using paws to grip on
cage in order to lift body and paws off the ground. Snifﬁng other mouse: One mouse’s nose
in near proximity of another mouse. Alogrooming: Grooming that occurs when one mouse
is grooming another mouse. Non-directed movement (during rest/sleep): Movement that
is localized to a few grids (3 grids) and does not use more than three-fourths of the animal’s
body. Sustained for no longer than 2 s. Exploratory ambulation: Movement that includes
snifﬁng and meets the deﬁnition of Stanford’s four stages of exploration: search, attend,
approach, and investigate while moving across multiple grids. Nestlet social engagement
(described in Tahimic et al., 2019 [48]): In social HU, when one mouse extends beyond
the halfway section of the shared cage and grabs a nestlet. Nestlet manipulation: Mouse
directly touching nestlet with mouth and/or forepaws. Mounting: Normally loaded
animals only. Mouse climbs on top of another mouse or has another mouse on top of it.
Snifﬁng (exploratory): Moving ahead with the nose held in the air. Ambulation: Moving
across multiple grids. Self-grooming: Mouse licking its own fur or grooming with paws.
With another mouse: Proximity and interaction between mice. Pulling another mouse:
While one mouse is climbing, the other pulls it by its mouth.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. Equal variances
across groups were evaluated by Levene’s test. If variances were equal, a one-way ANOVA
with Tukey’ or t-test post hoc was performed. For datasets with unequal variance and/or
non-normal distributions, a non-parametric Wilcoxon all pairs test was performed with
statistical signiﬁcance set at p < 0.05. Correlations were performed in JMP (SAS), Version
14.0.0. via multivariate platform and non-parametric Spearman’s ρ test. For all analyses,
the threshold for statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. HU Increased Activated Microglia in the Hippocampus
Increased CD68 levels are indicative of increased microglial activation. Hippocampal
sections were stained to visualize and quantify CD68 protein expression (Figure 1A).
Wild-type HU mice had a signiﬁcantly greater number of CD68+ cells than normally
loaded wild-type mice (Figure 1B). Interestingly, MCAT HU mice had a signiﬁcantly lower
CD68 count than wild-type HU mice (Figure 1B), indicating that mitochondrial catalase
expressions can reduce HU induced microglia activations in the hippocampus.

3.2. Correlation of CD68 Count and Hippocampal Cytokines
Correlation analysis was performed between hippocampal CD68 count and protein
expression of hippocampal cytokines (cytokine raw data are described in [20,50]). In total,
the expression of eight proteins (IL-1a, IL-3, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, RANTES, and MIP-3a)
had a signiﬁcant positive correlation with hippocampal CD68 counts (Figure 2). Five
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines were previously identiﬁed to be affected by [20], and three of
these cytokines are among the ones shown here to have a signiﬁcant correlation between
CD68 counts and cytokine proﬁles in the hippocampus (IL-3, IL-12, and IL-17).

correlations. * Statistically signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 using nonparametric Spearman’s.
3.3. Changes in Behavior Observed during Light and Dark Cycles
Observed animal behaviors were categorized into “active” (Figure 3A), “exploration”
(Figure 3B), “social interaction” (Figure 4), and “inactive” (including rest/sleep and non-
directional movement during sleep) (Figure 5). During the light cycle, MCAT HU mice
showed changes in behavior compared to wild-type HU mice, where reduced social be-

were observed.

Compared to light cycles, many more variations in behavior between most groups
were observed during dark cycles. All groups showed increased active behavior compared
to the light cycle, as expected. Only MCAT HU mice showed increased exploratory behavior
during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 3B). For social behavior, only normally
loaded mice showed increased behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles
(Figure 4). All groups but normally loaded MCAT mice had decreased rest/sleep behavior
during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 5A).
During the dark cycle, MCAT HU mice showed higher exploratory behaviors com-
pared to wild-type HU mice (Figure 3B) and higher active and exploratory behaviors
compared to normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 3A,B). For social behaviors during the
dark cycle, wild-type HU mice showed decreased behavior compared to normally loaded
wild-type mice (Figure 4), while MCAT HU mice also showed decreased behavior com-
pared to normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 4). For inactive behavior, rest/sleep activities
of normally loaded MCAT mice were greater than normally loaded wild-type mice, where
MCAT HU mice were lower than normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 5A). Moreover,
for non-directional movements during rest, wild-type HU mice had more activities than
normally loaded wild-type mice, and MCAT HU mice had more activities than normally
loaded MCAT mice (Figure 5B).
3.4. Correlations of Categorized Behaviors with Plasma and Hippocampal Cytokines
Next, we assessed correlations between categorized animal behavior during dark
cycles (in which animals perform most activities) and cytokine protein expression in the
hippocampus and in plasma (Figure 6) with the aim to identify potential biomarkers of
simulated microgravity consequences. In the hippocampus, correlations, either positive or
negative, were observed in 12 cytokines. The activity category with the most correlations
was explorative behavior, which was correlated positively with G-CSF and Mip3a and
negatively with INF γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, M-CSF, Mip2, and EPO (Figure 6).
Next, social interactions were positively correlated with IL-4, Mip2, and EPO and negatively
with G-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, and Mip3a (Figure 6). Inactive behavior correlated positively with
INF γ (rho- 0.03, data not shown). For plasma cytokines, active behavior was positively
correlated with G-CSF and KC and negatively correlated with Timp1. Inactive behavior was
negatively correlated with KC and positively with Timp1 (rho- 0.003 and 0.02, respectively,

Timp1 (Figure 6).

4. Discussion
Microgravity experienced during prolonged spaceﬂight results in neurological con-
sequences, CNS dysfunction, and potentially impairment in performances [51]. Rodent
hindlimb-unloading head-down tilt models have been utilized in ground-based studies to
elucidate stress responses in numerous tissues, the immune system, and CNS [52]. Further
investigations on the mechanisms of these responses are paramount for the identiﬁcation
of potential biomarkers as well as the development of future countermeasures. Previously,
we found that isolation also may impact the response to microgravity by masking its
effects [20]. Thus, in this current study, we were interested in assessing the effect of simu-
lated microgravity (without isolation with mice socially housed) on a subset of immune
responses of the hippocampus and behavioral outcomes.
The hippocampus is crucial for learning and memory, and any alterations in this
region can have detrimental consequences on CNS function. HU in mice led to protein
changes in the hippocampus, primarily in structural proteins and proteins involved in
metabolism [53]. A previous study reported the upregulation of CD68 in the soleus [54]
and increased microglia in spinal cord of male mice [18] that underwent HU. However,
there remains a gap with respect to HU-induced CD68 responses in the brain. We found,
in female mice that underwent HU, increased CD68 in the hippocampus, indicating an
HU-induced increased activation of microglia. Deep-space missions will expose crew
members to higher levels of radiation in addition to exposure to altered gravity. The
exposure of low doses of high-LET radiation can induce inﬂammatory processes and can
change cognition and behaviors [55]. Additionally, sex differences in cortical levels of CD68
and BDNF were observed in radiation exposure [56]. In accordance with our previous
work and with most relevant space rodent studies to date [55,57,58], we chose females
for this study. The additional reason for using females in our study was that, in studying
male behavior, there are a lot of masking effects due to male-to-male aggression when
housed in the same cage, and here, social housing was utilized. With the growing number
of female astronauts, identifying these responses in females to space environment stressors
is increasingly important. Sex differences are an important factor in the hippocampal stress

response; thus, we plan to explore these responses to simulated spaceﬂight in our future
studies and to assess if similar results will be seen in males.
There are several limitations of the HU model vs. spaceﬂight. During HU, the
forelimbs, head, and upper back remain weightbearing vs. the entire body unloading in
space. The HU model does not include the stress of launch and landing, and ﬂuid shifts are
not identical. Despite these limitations, this model is widely used and is instrumental in
demonstrating physiological changes that occur during unloading [59].
Sleep and ROS quenching have a reciprocal relationship; when there is a lack of sleep,
the accumulation of ROS might cause adverse effects [60]. Melatonin, a sleep-inducing
agent, decreased abnormal protein nitration, the accumulation of Aβ polypeptides, and
extended the lifespan in mice Alzheimer’s model brains [61]. In our study, as expected,
mice rest less during the dark cycle; interestingly, in the WT MCAT group, mice were
sleeping for the same period of time during the day and night, which could indicate a shift
in their circadian rhythm. HU mice present more non-directed movements during rest
compared to WT, which is probably led by the discomfort of HU, and these differences will
be investigated further in our future studies.
Chronic stress is a risk factor for various mental and degenerative disorders, both the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system are activated
and elicit glucocorticoids and noradrenaline, respectively. These stress pathways have both
simulating and suppressant effects on microglia depending on the speciﬁc environment [62].
Cytokines not only target microglia [8] but are also secreted by them, and their interactions
differ in normal (where cytokines work as signaling molecules) vs. pathological states,
where these pathways may spin out of control (e.g., cytokine storm) and cause a cycle of
chronic neuroinﬂammation. Acute and chronic stress, a known circumstance of prolonged
spaceﬂight, have also been shown to induce microglia activation resulting in an enhanced
release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines [10]. Mice that undergo HU have increased circula-
tory levels of corticosterone [20,48], an indicator of stress. We previously observed that HU
resulted in changes in the expression of ﬁve hippocampal cytokines. Four out of these ﬁve
cytokines (IL-3, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17) were upregulated in HU versus NL mice, while
IL-12 was downregulated. Additionally, HU elevated neutrophils and the neutrophil-to-
lymphocyte ratio [63] and IL-20 in plasma [20]. Here, hippocampal CD68 was correlated
with eight cytokines and chemokines, primarily those involved with T cell responses,
further indicating disruptions in the inﬂammatory status. Prolonged neuroinﬂammation is
associated with cognitive deﬁcits, mood disorders, and stress-related behavior [64]. In this
study, twelve hippocampal cytokines and ﬁve circulatory cytokines were correlated with
changes in exploratory and social behavior during the dark cycle. Additionally, we saw
that hippocampal IL-1, IL-13, and Mip3a have positive correlations with both hippocampal
microglia activation and negative correlations with social behavior. Similarly, hippocampal
IL-10 and IL-12p70, which are positively correlated with activated microglia, have negative
correlations with explorative behavior. IL-1 and IL-6 have previously been linked to sick
behavior and fatigue, [65] and when neutralized, they ameliorated speciﬁc neuropsychiatric
symptoms [66]. IL-10 and IL-12 are both produced by macrophages and dendritic cells.
IL-12 is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of inﬂammatory neurological diseases,
such as multiple sclerosis. Mip-3a is a chemokine recently shown to have an important role
in the autoimmune pathogenesis of the central nervous system. IL-13 has been shown to
control brain inﬂammation by enhancing activated microglia death and enhancing neuronal
survival [67].
It has been suggested before that there is an interplay between cytokines in the CNS
and behavior, which probably evolved to promote healing and self-isolating behavior to
protect other individuals from becoming infected. However, when this balance is disturbed
in age-related cognitive impairments and/or mood disorders, similar immune changes are
observed: for example, elevated CCL-11 plasma levels in schizophrenic patients [68]. The
negative correlation of the cytokines found here with exploratory behavior, together with
the elevated microglial state in the hippocampus, might illuminate similar pathways. It has

Life 2022, 12, 1838

been shown that IL-10 and IL-12 (P70) levels predict the risk of COVID-19 progression in
hypertensive patients [69]; in s similar manner, these cytokines could be used as biomarkers
for behavioral and molecular changes driven by neuroinﬂammation. It is still unclear if
cytokines drive stress-induced sickness behaviors or are a consequence of it, but since
the impact of these changes is crucial to many behavioral pathologies, ﬁnding more links
between immune and behavior changes is important for developing more speciﬁc therapies.
Altered expression levels in the plasma that correlate with inactive behavior (Timp1
and KC) could be useful as biomarkers for astronauts or patients with sedentary lifestyle.
The limitation of the correlations found in this study lays in its limited sample number; thus,
these results must be veriﬁed in larger groups. Previous studies have shown that hindlimb
unloading affects the blood–brain barrier’s integrity [70]; in future studies, it would be
also interesting to assess whether peripherally inﬁltrating microglia such as monocytes are
present in the brain of hindlimb-unloaded animals.
A prolonged inflammatory state has been linked to an increase in oxidative damage [71,72].
Spaceflight and ground-based models have demonstrated oxidative stress affecting the brain and
immune response, as reviewed previously [51,71]. Additionally, oxidative stress is associated
with physiological and cellular changes in the CNS [71,73]. In an animal chronic social defeat,
observed deficits in behavior were attributed to elevated levels of ROS and activated microglia.
While activated microglia release pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia are also activated by
cytokines released by damaged neurons. HU in mice has been shown to induce oxidative stress
in the brain, resulting in lipid peroxidation and the activation of NF-κb [25], a transcription
factor that induces the expression pro-inflammatory cytokines. This in turn, induces the
formation of ROS, resulting in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation
further perpetuating the cycle and a chronic inflammatory state. Therefore, we tested whether
mitochondrial ROS is a potential mechanism for neuroimmune deficits caused by simulated
microgravity. Previously we saw that mitochondrial ROS quenching reduced cytokine protein
levels in the hippocampus and mitigated the effects of HU and of social isolation [20]. Here, we
observed a reduction in hippocampal CD68 in MCAT mice that underwent HU compared to
the WT, indicating an important role of ROS in HU-induced microglia activation and that it is a
potential target for countermeasures (Figure 7).
Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a
biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for
the treatment/prevention of cognitive changes astronauts experience due to prolonged
spaceﬂight. Microglia activation may be suitable candidates for examining this relationship.
Microglia have been implicated in a number of neurological disorders, including multi-
ple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, strokes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson’s
disease [3], and they may be appropriate targets for prevention or treatment. Overall, our
study sheds new light on the underlying mechanism of how simulated microgravity causes
neuroinﬂammation, implicating microglial brain activation, and links this process to behav-
ioral consequences. Additionally, we show that microglial activation in the hippocampus
caused by simulated microgravity is mitigated by ROS quenching. Hence, in future studies,
it would be interesting to investigate antioxidant treatments in both astronauts and patients
with sedentary lifestyles.
