Abstract: Understanding genome wide, tissue-speciﬁc, and spaceﬂight-induced changes in gene
expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. Transcriptome analysis has been performed on
diverse tissues harvested from animals ﬂown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome
wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice ﬂown in space
for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney
from animals ﬂown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there
common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceﬂight
stimuli? Although there were tissue-speciﬁc changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes
in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen
compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of
protein kinase.

1. Introduction
Transcriptome and proteasome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from
several animal species ﬂown in space. Many gene and gene pathway changes associated with changes
due to the diverse stimuli of spaceﬂight have been identiﬁed: microgravity, radiation exposure,
reduction, and reduction of convection, to say nothing about the effects of launch, maneuvers,
and landing.
By analyzing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals ﬂown in space versus ground
control animals, we can test a unique hypothesis: Are there tissue speciﬁc gene expression pathways
activated in individual tissue types in response to spaceﬂight stimuli? For pathways that are common,
do the same genes predominate, or is the distribution of contributing pathway speciﬁc genes differ?
Using liver and kidney harvested from the same mice after spaceﬂight and identically housed ground
controls, direct comparison can be made between tissues without confounding effects of sex, strain,
species, and age, while minimizing differences in microbiome and epigenetics.

during Hurricane Katrina. We present the data now because contemporary analysis methods can be
applied to this unique data set to directly address unanswered but relevant questions.
2. Results
2.1. Gene Arrays
Liver and kidney tissues showed similar gene response to spaceﬂight. Figure 1 shows responses of
12,489 genes in liver versus kidney, expressed as a fold change in space ﬂown versus ground controls,
as analyzed by Affymetrix hybridization, along with representative heat maps for the two tissues.
(Fold change, average expression, t scores, p-values, and adjusted p values for each gene can be found
in Supplementary Table S1.) Of note, CYP4A1 was increased in space-ﬂown liver, whereas over 20
other CYP genes did not change.

(y-axis) plotted against kidney (x-axis).
2.2. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) provides a computational method to determine whether
an a priori deﬁned set of genes shows statistically signiﬁcant and concordant differences between
spaceﬂight and ground controls. GSEA calculates a score for the enrichment of an entire set of genes
rather than a single gene. It does not, however, require setting a cutoff, but does allow for an analysis of
the complete data set and thus identiﬁes the set of relevant genes as part of the analysis, providing a
robust statistical framework. Using a modiﬁed Fisher’s exact test, the replicates are integrated into the
analysis so that no data are lost [1].
Of the 785 gene ontology (GO) pathways analyzed by GSEA, 764 trended towards concordance
between liver and kidney tissue response to spaceﬂight (Figure 2).

Figure 2. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment scores for space-ﬂown vs. ground
control mouse liver and kidney. GSEA calculates a score for the enrichment of an entire set of genes
across a gene ontology (GO) pathway. A positive score indicates enrichment in the space-ﬂown mice
relative to the ground controls. In 764 of the 785 pathways analyzed, there was enrichment in both
kidney and liver in response to spaceﬂight. The nine pathways that were upregulated in liver and
downregulated in kidney are listed in the upper left corner and detailed in Table 1. The 12 pathways
that were upregulated in kidney but downregulated in liver are listed on the lower right corner and
detailed in Table 2.
Furthermore, nine pathways were upregulated in the liver and downregulated in the kidney.
Five of those pathways were related to T cell activation and the others were related to calcium
channel, extracellular matrix structure, heart development, and hormone metabolism (see Table 1
for details). Moreover, 12 pathways were upregulated only in kidney but downregulated in liver,
whereas only three of those pathways were related to peptide binding and two were related to
coagulation. The others were related to amino acid metabolism, rhodopsin-like receptor, cell division,
DNA packaging, Golgi compartment, and cytokinesis (see Table 2 for details).

2.3. Cytoscape/ClueGO
ClueGO visualizes the interactions of gene clusters in a functionally grouped network using
enrichment maps. Similar to the GSEA analysis, liver and kidney showed striking similarities in the
ways that they responded to spaceﬂight (Figures 3 and 4). Both tissues overexpressed genes in the same
four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds;
(b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation, and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.
In many cases, the exact same pathways were overexpressed in both tissues, as noted by the clusters
identiﬁed with arrows in Figures 3 and 4. Additional details of the genes for each node can be found
in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2.

3. Discussion
By analyzing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals ﬂown in space versus ground
control animals, we were able to evaluate the extent to which tissues from different organs respond to
spaceﬂight in shared ways versus organ-speciﬁc ways. We began by examining gene arrays using
Affymetrix hybridization and heat maps. We then analyzed the results through GSEA to look for
changes across sets of genes, rather than single genes, in order to identify pathways that were in
common between the tissues or unique to the particular organs. Finally, we visualized the data by
Cytoscape with ClueGO to identify interactions of gene clusters in kidney versus liver.
The ﬁrst major ﬁnding of this study was that we had not only shown tissue speciﬁc gene pathway
response to spaceﬂight, but we have identiﬁed those gene pathways.
GSEA analysis of the samples identiﬁed signiﬁcant liver-speciﬁc changes in genes for T cell
activation, calcium channel, extracellular matrix structure, heart development, and hormone metabolism.
It is likely that the upregulated T cell activation genes in the liver came from inﬁltrating T cells.
Activation of T cells in spaceﬂight has been well-described [2], as has the inﬁltration of the liver with
inﬂammatory mononuclear cells [3]. GSEA analysis also identiﬁed signiﬁcant kidney-speciﬁc changes
in peptide binding, amine receptor, amino acid catabolism, rhodopsin-like receptor, coagulation,
cell division, DNA packaging, cytokinesis, and Golgi compartment.

The second major ﬁnding of this study was that there were common gene pathways upregulated
in both the liver and kidney during spaceﬂight. Both tissues overexpressed genes in the same four areas:
(a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis
and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation, and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase. Our ﬁndings
in these areas are consistent with the other reports on the livers from mice ﬂown in space, such as an
altered ability to respond to insulin [4], impaired management of reactive oxidation (an integral part of
apoptosis) [3,5], dysregulated lipid metabolism [3,4], and altered protein kinases [5].
Blaber et al. performed unbiased, unsupervised, and integrated multi-omic analyses of metabolomic
and transcriptomic data sets on liver tissue derived from nine-week old weight-matched female
C57BL/6J mice ﬂown in space for 13.5 days [3]. They observed an increased enrichment of genes
associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. The current data sets show changes in
cell death pathways in both kidney and liver, with an emphasis on apoptosis, but also autophagy.
Blaber et al. also reported hepatic negative regulation of protein phosphorylation [3], something we
now demonstrate in space ﬂown kidney tissue.
Like Blaber et al., we saw a highly signiﬁcant increase in Cdkn1a, the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 1A (P21), in hepatic tissue and now report the same observation in kidney tissue. Cdkn1a
gene encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor with a regulatory role in S phase DNA
replication, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. The effect of Cdkn1a activation is apparent in the
overexpression of apoptosis-regulating pathways in both liver and kidney tissues in space.
Baba et al. analyzed gene and protein expression of 11 cytochrome P450s and stress-associated
molecules in liver tissue from male Sprague–Dawley rats, aged 65 days at launch and ﬂown in space
for nine days [6]. The gene and protein expression of stress-related proteins CYP4A1and Cirp gene
expression was signiﬁcantly increased whereas HSP90 and p53 gene expression was signiﬁcantly
decreased in the ﬂight group than in the ground control. Combined with histology, it was concluded
that the effects of spaceﬂight on the liver may be similar to mild cold stress or fasting. From our data,
we can conﬁrm a large increase in hepatic CYP4A1 during spaceﬂight, as 47 other hepatic CYPs did not
change in space. This is consistent with the ﬁnding of Brown et al. in the rotating wall vessel, that rat
hepatocytes maintained CYP functions and albumin production for more than 30 days in suspension
culture [7]. In our data, HSP90 and p53 gene expression were decreased in the ﬂight group similar to
the observations of Baba et al. [6], but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
Baqai et al. harvested liver, spleen, and thymus from female C57BL/6 mice ﬂown for 13 days
in order to study the effects of spaceﬂight on innate immune function and antioxidant gene
expression [5]. During the ﬂight, animals had a reduction in liver, spleen, and thymus masses,
compared with ground controls; splenic lymphocyte, monocyte/macrophage, and granulocyte counts
were signiﬁcantly reduced in the ﬂight mice. Baqai et al. concluded that exposure to the spaceﬂight
environment can increase anti-inﬂammatory mechanisms. No transcriptome analysis was performed.
We observed an alpha-beta T-cell activation that is heavily liver-speciﬁc, suggesting different immune
responses in the liver and kidney during spaceﬂight.
Martinez et al. found a signiﬁcant reduction of key gene expression in early T-cell activation
in C57BL/6J wild-type female mice of similar age and weight ﬂown in space for 15 days [2].
They demonstrated decreases in gene expression for IL2, IL2Rα, and IFNγ during spaceﬂight.
In our data IL2, IL2Rα, and IFNγ gene expression was decreased in the ﬂight group similar to
the observations of Martinez et al., but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance [2].
Pecaut et al. studied age- and weight-matched, 11-week-old female C57BL/6J mice ﬂown in
space for ~13 days [4]. There were increases in liver expression proﬁles related to fatty acid oxidation
with decreases in glycolysis-related proﬁles. They suggested that, given the clear link between
immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, a similar link may be involved in
spaceﬂight-induced decrements. Our data demonstrates changes in lipid metabolism in both liver and
kidney tissues in space and further clariﬁes the gene pathway mediators.

In the kidney, we conﬁrm many of the pathways implicated in responses to spaceﬂight and
rotating wall suspension culture in renal proximal tubular cells [8,9].
During spaceﬂight, we
conﬁrmed changes we previously observed in kidney gene pathways, including apoptosis and cellular
response to peptides [8]. During the rotating wall suspension culture of renal proximal tubular cells,
we observed changes in phosphorylation and protein kinase activity similar to the changes incurred in
spaceﬂight [9].
Spaceﬂight is a complex mixture of changes in gravity, convection, radiation exposure, and other
stressors. While we do not have a detailed similar date on the isolated stimuli for comparison, changes
in cell cycle, DNA packing, and oxygenation are consistent with changes in these pathways observed
in a number of other systems [10].
We report tissue-speciﬁc gene expression pathways in liver and kidney during spaceﬂight, and for
gene pathways that are common, there is a substantial concurrence of the genes that predominate
many pathways in both tissues. The conﬁrmation of data from single tissue ﬁndings in the literature
suggests that our study is reliable. Utilizing liver and kidney tissue harvested from the same mice
after spaceﬂight and identically housed ground controls, is a powerful protocol to optimally remove
confounding effects of sex, strain, species, and age, while minimizing differences in micro biome
and epigenetics.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Reagents
All reagents were purchased from Sigma Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA), unless otherwise noted.
4.2. Spaceﬂight Conditions and Ground Based Controls.
Working in collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center and Bioserve Space Technologies,
female C57BL/6J mice were housed in the animal enclosure module (AEM) with special food bars,
redundant lixit water supply, and a waste management system. The experiment consisted of six AEMs
each with eight mice per AEM. On the space shuttle, three AEMs ﬂew and three served as ground
controls. The protocol was reviewed by the Ames IACUC (that served as the Flight IACUC) and was
approved on 8 August 2001. The title of protocol was “Investigation of osteoprotegerin as a treatment
for spaceﬂight induced osteopenia on UF-1:STS-108:CBT M-01 payload” and the protocol number
was 01-028A-1.
The mice were in space for 11 days and 19 hours. Animals were removed from the space shuttle,
released from the AEMs, euthanized, kidney and liver tissues harvested as rapidly as practical,
and snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen. In each group, eight mice were analyzed. The animals were
controls in a study conducted by Amgen, after review by NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. The present study examines used tissues discarded from Amgen’s
studies and therefore did not undergo separate review by the committee.
4.3. RNA Extraction
Samples were transferred to pre-chilled tubes that contained 10 microliters of RNAseOUT (400 U)
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Added to the tubes and tissues was 3 mL of Trizol homogenized on
ice. RNA was extracted using our standard protocol [8,11]. RNA purity was conﬁrmed by the ratio of
OD260 nm to OD 280 nm, which averaged 1.7 and 1.8, and by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with 18S
and 28S ribosomal bands corresponding to sizes on a ladder.
4.4. Gene Arrays
Gene arrays were performed on Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) GeneChip®Murine
Genome U95Av2.1 (MG-U95Av2.1) set arrays.
This array contains transcript coverage of the
mouse genome to study the expression level of more than 60,000 murine genes and expressed

sequence tags, including ~12,000 sequences characterized in terms of function or disease association.
Hybridization controls included bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre. Poly A controls were dap, lys, phe, thr,
and trp. Housekeeping/control genes were glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin,
transferrin receptor, and interferon-stimulated gene factor-3. Gene arrays were performed at the
Medical College of Georgia.
4.5. Data Analysis and Statistics
Affymetrix Gene Chip microarray data underwent strict quality control processing using the affy
package [12] in Bioconductor [1] in the R statistical programming environment. Log-scale Robust
Multiarray Analysis was used for normalization to eliminate systematic differences across the arrays.
Signiﬁcant differentially expressed genes were identiﬁed using a linear regression model with an
empirical Bayes method for parameter estimation from the limma package [13] in the Bioconductor.
The False Discovery Rate method was employed to control for multiple hypothesis testing.
To perform GSEA, we used Gene Ontology (GO) pathway gene sets found at the Molecular
Signatures Database. The DNA microarray data was compared between space ﬂown and ground
control tissues and analyzed as to whether the majority of genes in a set fell in the extremes of the
list: the top (overexpressed) and bottom (underexpressed) of the list, corresponding to the largest
differences in expression between the two conditions. If the gene set was signiﬁcantly overexpressed
or underexpressed, it was taken to be related to phenotypic differences.
4.6. Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis
We obtained gene ontology annotations of murine genes using ClueGO. ClueGO is a Cytoscape
plug-in that visualizes the non-redundant biological terms for large clusters of genes in a functionally
grouped network. ClueGO network is created with kappa statistics and reﬂects the relationships
between the terms based on the similarity of their associated genes.
GO biological processes that were too speciﬁc (containing less than ﬁve genes) or too general
(containing greater than 300 genes) were excluded from the analysis.
Given a query set of genes, we used the hyper geometric test to obtain a P value, estimating the
signiﬁcance with which the set is enriched with genes annotated to a given biological process, relative
to a gene universe deﬁned as the set of genes with usable data for both static and rotating conditions.
4.7. Cytoscape Analysis Using ClueGO
We visualized GO enrichment results with enrichment maps that were generated using an
approach similar to the Enrichment Map Cytoscape Plugin v1.1 [10,14,15]. In contrast to the plugin,
the nodes in each map were clustered with Markov cluster (inﬂation = 2), using the overlap coefﬁcient
computed by the plugin as the similarity metric (coefﬁcients less than 0.5 were set to zero). Nodes
in the same cluster were assigned the same node color and a cluster label was determined based on
common themes in the processes within the cluster.
5. Conclusions
Liver and kidney show both tissue-speciﬁc and shared tissue-common responses to the stress of
spaceﬂight. Liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to
peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat
cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.
CYP4A1 was increased in
space-ﬂown liver, whereas over 20 other CYP genes did not change. Cdkn1a, which encodes a
potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor with a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication, DNA
damage repair, and apoptosis was particularly signiﬁcantly overexpressed in both liver and kidney
tissues in space.
