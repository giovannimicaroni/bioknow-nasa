The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone
growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth
plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen
and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the
roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/
6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-
matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain ﬁlm at the 12 weeks old. We
conﬁrm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice
(p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and
hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of
ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body
length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERa in
growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three
groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERa antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERb antagonist
(PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the
groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for
6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin
deﬁciency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal
bone growth. These ﬁndings suggested that region-speciﬁc expression of ERa might
be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/
ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin
deﬁciency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to
be explored in future work.

INTRODUCTION
Leptin, a protein encoded by obese gene (ob), has been shown to have regulative effects on
longitudinal bone growth, spongiosa maturation, and bone turnover between cortical and
cancellous bones (1). The mammalian second growth spurt period occurs at puberty. One of the
characterizations for the growth spurt is rapid skeletal longitudinal growth. Results in a clinical

investigation, in order to clarify the relationship between
anthropometric data and concentrations of serum leptin in the
catch-up growth procedure, showed that increasing leptin
concentrations might trigger catch-up growth in children
recovering from malnutrition (2). Furthermore, leptin was
considered as an important facilitator in early puberty (3). In
addition, ﬁndings of leptin deﬁciency in mice and humans
leading to abnormal bone development suggested that leptin
plays a novel role in the linear growth of bone (4–7).
Endochondral bone formation is the key procedure for growth
plate(GP),inwhich GPchondrocytes undergoa series oforganized
procedures including proliferation, maturation, hypertrophic
differentiation, and calciﬁcation (8–10). These complex and
delicate programs of endochondral bone formation are
responsible for the skeletal elongation. The femoral GP of ob/ob
mice is abnormal combined with poorly organized collagen ﬁbril
anddecreasedtheexpressionleveloftypeXcollagen(7).Furtherlab
investigations showed that leptin could enhance the proliferation
and differentiation of GP chondrocytes ex vivo (11). Additional
leptin treatment increased condyle height in an organ model (12).
Importantly, supplementation of leptin to ob/ob mice could reverse
the defects in femoral GP and bone morphology (7, 12, 13).
However, interesting different growth patterns have been shown
in ob/ob mice with a shorter femora length and a longer vertebral
length than wild-type (WT) mice (7), while the underlying
mechanism of this contrasting phenotypes still remains unclear.
Although leptin played an important role in the abnormal
skeletal bone growth, leptin was a multiple-effect hormone,
affecting energy metabolism, appetite, thermogenesis, immune
system, and neuroendocrine (14, 15), each of which could
independently determine the growth pattern of skeletal bone
longitudinal growth (16). Leptin is responsible for the secretion of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and leptin deﬁciency directly
leads to a reduced level of estrogen in ob/ob mice (17). Estrogen
and its receptor (ERa and ERb) signaling pathway played an
essential role in skeletal growth, and the absence of estrogen in
rats presented an accelerated bone elongation as compared with
that in normal female rats (18, 19). Effects of differentERs (a and b)
on the axial and appendicular bone elongation were distinct, which
were proved by ER knock-out mice. ERa knock-out mice showed a
decreasing bone growth, while mice with inactivation of ERb had
increased appendicular bone growth (20–22). Our previous study
also showed that blocking different ERs presented opposite effects
on the appendicular longitudinal growth (23). Recently, a crosstalk
effect between leptin and ERs in the endochondral bone formation
has been reported in our previous study (24), and a stage-speciﬁc
effect of leptin on the ER expression was obvious during the
hypertrophic differentiation stage in a model of chondrocyte
differentiation in vitro (25). The integration of estrogen and leptin
signaling, which is responsible for contrasting growth patterns in
appendicular and axial longitudinal growth via ERs, is
still unknown.
Therefore, we hypothesize that leptin deﬁciency may
inﬂuence the ER expression in axial and appendicular GP
in vivo, contributing to the contrasting phenotypes of skeletal
growth in ob/ob mice. The current study was designed to
determine the role of ERs in the skeletal longitudinal growth of
leptin deﬁciency mice. We examine the femur and spinal GP using
densitometric, histomorphometric, and immunohistochemical
techniques to expand our current understanding of how the
absence of leptin affects axial and appendicular growth.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Animals
Three-week-old female B6/JGpt-Lepem1Cd25/Gpt mice on the
C57BL/6 background (ob/ob mice, n = 6/group) and 3-week-
old female C57BL/6 (n = 6/group) mice were purchased from
Nanjing GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. Animals were housed and
kept in 12-h daylight and nightlight conditions with standard
mouse feed and sterile water. Our animal protocol was approved
by the animal experiment ethical committee of Peking University
People’s Hospital.
Experimental Procedures
In total, 24 C57BL/6 mice and 24 ob/ob mice were purchased
from GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China) and were
randomly divided into eight groups. In the ﬁrst stage, C57BL/6
was used as WT (n = 6), ob/ob mouse was used as ob/ob (n = 6).
These two groups of mice did not receive any drug treatment and
were euthanized for tissue collection. In order to determine the
role of ERs in skeletal growth of ob/ob mice, the second stage was
performed as follows: WT, ob/ob control (ob/ob + ctrl), ob/ob
mice treated with methyl-piperidino-pyrazole, an ERa-selective
antagonist (ob/ob + MPP), and ob/ob mice were treated with 4-
(2-phenyl-5,7-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)pyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidin-3-
yl)phenol, an ERb-selective antagonist (ob/ob + PHTPP). After 1
week of adaptive feeding, mice were treated with different kinds
of ER antagonists during the puberty of female mice (4 to 10
weeks). The control group ob/ob mice were subcutaneously
injected with 100 ml of saline solution. The MPP group mice
and PHTPP group mice were intraperitoneally injected with
MPP [0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1‰ dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)] and PHTPP (0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1‰
DMSO), respectively, according to previous studies (23, 26).
All the groups received injections at 5 days/week for 6 weeks. The
body weight of each mouse was recorded every week.
X-Ray Radiography Image
At the end of each stage, X-ray radiography (Shanghai United
Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) was used to get
the images of all mice, which were in the prone position. Femur
length and spine (L1–L6) length were quantiﬁed using ImageJ
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The femur length was recorded
as appendicular length, and the spine length was recorded as
axial length.
Tissue Sample Length Measurements
and Collection
After euthanasia, the femur and lumbar L5 vertebrae were ﬁxed
in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 h. Ten percent

ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used for
decalciﬁcation of these bone tissues for at least 3 weeks. After
decalciﬁcation, the femur and spine were embedded in parafﬁn
for future histological analysis.
Quantitative Histology of Axial and
Appendicular Growth Plate Using
H&E Staining
H&E staining and the quantitative analysis of GP were
performed according to previous studies (23). Brieﬂy, 4-mm-
thick two nonconsecutive sections were made from parafﬁn of
femur and lumbar (L5 vertebrae) tissues of each mouse and were
then deparafﬁnized with xylene, followed by staining with H&E
according to the manual protocol. The quantitative analysis was
carried out by measuring the GP under the ×10 magniﬁcation
using Nikon Eclipse microscope (Nikon, Japan). The height of
GP was recorded by the mean values of 20 measurements per
section. Furthermore, the height of the proliferative and
hypertrophic zones was analyzed by 20 columns in each
section and was recorded as an average. ImageJ (NIH,
Bethesda, MD) was used to measure the height of the femur
and lumbar GP height in a blind method.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, the traverse sections
were baked for 50 min at 60°C, then rehydrated in xylene and
graded ethanol, and ﬁnally washed with water, with 5 min in
each step. Sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 in order to
eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity; then phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) was used for washing. After retrieval and
blocking, these sections incubated with rabbit antibody of anti-
Collagen II (1:200, Afﬁnity, USA, Catalog AF0135),
anti-Collagen X (1:250, Afﬁnity, USA, Catalog DF13214), anti-
Aggrecan (1:200, Abcam, USA, Catalog ab216965), and
anti-MMP13 (1:250, Afﬁnity, USA, Catalog AF5355) at 4°C
overnight. After being washed with PBS thrice, these slides
were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, these slides were incubated
in ABC complex for 30 min. Staining was detected with 3,3′-
diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxide substrate solution for 3 min,
followed by rinsing in distilled water. The sections were
dehydrated by graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted
with permount medium after counterstaining with Gill’s
hematoxylin solution for 3 min. The results were analyzed and
photographed by a digital microscope (Nikon, Japan).
TUNEL Assay (Apoptosis Analysis)
The TUNEL assay was performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, USA). Brieﬂy, the apoptotic
GP cells were identiﬁed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(TdT)-mediated deoxy UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) IHC.
The DAB method was used to detect the staining. The positive
cells were counted within the GP and presented as a percentage
of the total cells.
Quantiﬁcation of Immunohistochemistry
Staining
The semiquantitative analysis method was used to evaluate the
intensity of these immunoreactivity, measured by histological
score (HSCORE) according to our previous study (23). The
average results were addressed in a ×40 image. Brieﬂy, the
immunohistochemical localization was evaluated in a
semiquantitative fashion focused on the intensity of staining
area. The immunoreactive intensity of COL II, aggrecan, COL X,
MMP13, ERa, and ERb was assessed semiquantitatively
according to categories of intensity: 0, no staining; 1, weak but
detectable staining; 2, moderate or distinct staining; and 3,
intense staining. In each ﬁeld, the staining area was evaluated
by summing the percentages of the area. The total score of each
group was calculated as follows: HSCORE = Si I × Pi (i
represents the score of intensity, and Pi is the corresponding
percentage of the areas).
Femur Growth Plate Harvest and
RNA Extraction
The distal femur or vertebrae were median incised using a
surgical blade, and the GP can be seen under the ﬁeld of a
microscope. Micro-forcep was used to harvest the GP tissue. The
harvested GP tissues were immediately placed in TRIzol reagent
(Life Technologies). A homogenizer was used to make the
homogenized GP. Then, the total RNA was extracted
according to our previous studies (23, 25). NanoDrop
spectrophotometer was used to quantify RNA, and 0. 5 mg was
reverse transcribed into cDNA.
Real-Time Quantitative PCR
Gene expression was evaluated by qPCR using a Roche
LightCycler® 480II (Roche Diagnostics). PCR ampliﬁcation
was performed with TB green premix Ex Taq (Takara)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The forward and
reverse primer sequences were as follows: ERa: 5′-CCTC
CCGCCTTCTACAGGT-3′ and 5′-CACACGGCACAGTAG
CGAG-3′; ERb: 5′-CTGTGCCTCTTCTCACAAGGA-3′ and
5′-TGCTCCAAGGGTAGGATGGAC-3′; b-actin: 5′-
GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′ and 5′ -CCAG
TTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′. The progress of qPCR
contained two steps: ﬁrst, an initial 30 s of heating to 95°C and
then 20 cycles consisting of 5 s at 95°C followed by 20 s at 60°C.
The DDCt method was used to evaluate the transcript levels, and
data were normalized for input based on b-actin and expressed
relative to mice in the control group.
Western Blotting Analysis
The distal femur or vertebrae were median incised using a surgical
blade, and the GP can be seen under the ﬁeld of a microscope. All
GP tissues were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
buffer (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China), and the protein concentration
was analyzed using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Beyotime,
Jiangsu, China). The tissue lysates (35 mg) were separated by 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-
PAGE) using electrophoresis, and then the proteins were

transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane. After
being blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, the membranes were
incubated with primary anti-ERa (1:1,000, afﬁnity, USA, Catalog
No. AF6058), anti-ERb (1:1,000, afﬁnity, USA, Catalog No.
AF6469), and GAPDH (1:5,000, ProteinTech, China, Catalog No.
10494-1-AP) at 4°C overnight. After being washed thrice with PBS,
the membranes were incubated with an appropriate secondary
antibody. Finally, the membranes were determined by Bio-Rad
ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) and were quantiﬁed
by ImageJ software.
Statistical Analysis
All the data were presented as mean ± SD. The unpaired t-test
was used to analyze the differences in parameters between WT
and ob/ob mice, the differences between control group and
treated groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA methods,
and post-hoc analysis was carried out with Bonferroni’s test.
Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed to correlate the
HSCORE of ERa and limb/spine length. A p-value <0.05 was
considered as statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analysis was
performed using the SPSS (IBM, 22.0, USA) software.
RESULTS
At the end of mice’s puberty, X-ray was performed to collect
images of the femur and lumbar spine. As shown in Figure 1, the
femur of ob/ob mice was shorter than that of WT mice, and the
lumbar length of ob/ob mice was longer than that of WT mice,
which suggested that leptin deﬁciency mice had the contrasting
phenotypes between femoral and lumbar spinal growth
compared with those of WT mice. H&E staining of femoral
and vertebral sections was used to investigate the thickness of GP
in WT mice and ob/ob mice. The body weight (Figure 1D) of ob/
ob mice was higher than that of WT mice at the beginning of the
experiment (4-week-old mice), which was in line with the
phenotype of obese ob/ob mice. The femur GP height of ob/ob
mice was thinner than that of WT mice (Figures 2A, B), while
the spinal GP of ob/ob mice was thicker than that of WT mice
(Figures 2F, G). Additional histological analysis for the
proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone of femur GP showed
that both zones were decreased in the ob/ob mice compared with
WT mice (Figure 2C), while the ratio of hypertrophic/
proliferative zone of femoral GP was higher in ob/ob mice
than in WT mice (Figures 2D, E). Located at the spinal GP,
the proliferative zone in ob/ob mice was thicker than that of WT
mice. However, there was no difference in the hypertrophic/
proliferative zone ratio between ob/ob and WT mice
(Figures 2G–J).
During the terminal differentiation procedure, GP
hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis with calciﬁcation
of cartilaginous matrix followed by deposition of new bone. The
positive number of TUNEL (+) chondrocytes at the hypertrophic
zone were evaluated using a percentage of the total number of
cells in the hypertrophic zone. At the end of our experiment (12-
week-old WT mice), the mean percentage of apoptotic TUNEL-
positive cells among the femur GP hypertrophic chondrocytes
was 14.38 (Figure 3A). However, in 12-week-old ob/ob control
mice, the percentage of apoptotic vertebral GP chondrocytes in
the hypertrophic zone was greater (35.1%). The apoptosis rate in
the vertebral GP chondrocytes of ob/ob mice was lower than that
of WT mice (Figure 3B).
The above results showed that ob/ob mice have opposite
growth pattern between axial and appendicular growth
compared with that of WT mice at the end of pubertal time.
To determine the proliferation and hypertrophy fate of GP
chondrocytes in the femur and spine, we performed IHC
staining with proliferative marker (collagen II and aggrecan)
and hypertrophic marker (collagen X and MMP13) on the femur
and spinal GP (Figure 4). Collagen II and aggrecan were
decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice compared with those
of WT mice (Figure 4). Interestingly, we found that the
expression of collagen II and aggrecan was higher in the spinal
GP of ob/ob mice compared with the WT mice or the femur GP
of ob/ob mice (Figure 5). Similarly, the expression of collagen X
and MMP13 was also decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice,
while the hypertrophic markers were highly expressed in the
spinal GP of ob/ob mice. Overall, the reverse expression pattern
of differentiation and hypertrophic markers demonstrated that
leptin deﬁciency decreased the femur length via decreasing the
expression of proliferative and hypertrophic marker genes and
increasing the spinal length by enhancing these markers’ expression.

Previous studies have reported that ERs (a and b) play an
important role in regulating the longitudinal bone growth. To
further investigate mechanisms of contrasting growth
phenotype of axial and appendicular growth, the Western
blotting (WB), IHC, and qPCR methods were used to
determine whether an opposite expression pattern of ERs
existed in the femur and spinal GP (Figure 6). Interestingly,
we found that the expression level of ERa was not only
decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice. The spinal GP of
ob/ob mice highly expressed the ERa compared with spinal GP
of WT mice or the femur GP of ob/ob mice. In addition, the
results of Spearman’s analysis showed that axial length and
appendicular length were positively correlated with the
expression level of ERa (Figures 5L, M). Collectively, the
region-speciﬁc expression of ERa in the spinal and femur GP
of ob/ob mice may play a role in the reverse growth pattern
between axial and appendicular bone growth.
In order to determine the role of ERa in skeletal growth
pattern of ob/ob mice, ERa and ERb antagonists (MPP and
PHTPP) were used. As shown in Figure 7, in the WT mice,

blocking ERa led to a decreased femur length, and blocking ERb
resulted in an increased femur length compared with that in the
non-treated WT mice. Furthermore, ER antagonists did not
present regulative effects on the spinal length. The results of
H&E staining, as shown in Figure 7, also showed that blocking
ERa resulted in a thinner femur GP, and blocking ERb increased
the thickness of femur GP compared with that in non-treated
WT mice, while ER antagonists did not inﬂuence the vertebral
GP. These data were in line with our previous study (23).
However, in ob/ob mice, any kind of ER antagonists did not
present regulatory effects on the femur length and GP.
Collectively, these data demonstrated that the absence of leptin
might disturb the regulatory effects of ERs on the femur growth
pattern. Precision mechanisms of region-speciﬁc ERa expression
in femoral and vertebral GP in ob/ob mice still need to be
explored in the future.
DISCUSSION
Although the contrasting phenotypes in bone of the limb and
spine were observed in leptin deﬁciency mice, the reason and
mechanisms remain unclear and need to be explored. The
current study provides further evidence for the effects of leptin
deﬁciency on the contrasting phenotypes on axial and
appendicular bone growth, in which leptin deﬁciency results in
region-speciﬁc expression of ERa at the femoral and vertebral
GP in ob/ob female mice. According to the axial and
appendicular bone length results, we showed that ob/ob mice
have a shorter femur length and a longer spinal length than WT
mice. IHC staining results also showed opposite results of
proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral and spinal
GP of ob/ob mice. Expression of ERs using IHC, WB, and qPCR
methods demonstrated that femur GP has a lower level of ERa,

and spinal GP has a higher level of ERa in ob/ob mice compared
with those of WT mice. No differences were observed in the
expression of ERb of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice.
Spearman’s analysis showed that body length was positively
correlated with the expression level of ERa. Antagonists of ERs
showed a different regulatory effect on femur length in WT mice,
but blocking different ERs did not present regulatory effects on
the skeletal longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Taken together,
our data suggested that the contrasting phenotypes in bone
growth of spine and limb induced by leptin deﬁciency may

partially attribute to region-speciﬁc expression of ERa in the
femoral and spinal GP. Leptin deﬁciency also blunted the
regulatory effects of ER antagonists on the longitudinal growth
in ob/ob mice. Still, the underlying mechanisms of the cross talk
between leptin and ER signaling need to be studied in the future.
Puberty was the second growth peak in mammals. Except for
the secondary sexual characteristics, body longitudinal growth
was one of the important markers of the puberty (27). In
addition to the regulation of metabolism and reproduction,
leptin was reportedly important for the skeletal bone growth
(12). Recently, leptin deﬁciency has been shown to lead to a
shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length compared
with WT mice using the 6-month-old and prepubertal female
ob/ob mice (7, 28, 29). Supplementation of leptin has been
shown to increase femoral length in ob/ob mice, but it could
not achieve absolute re-established length as compared with WT
mice (28, 30). In the present study, we conﬁrmed that leptin
deﬁciency induced a shorter femoral length and a longer
vertebrae length in the post-pubertal (12-week old) ob/ob mice
compared with WT mice, which suggested that the absence of
leptin may be the primary factor for the contrasting growth
pattern between limb and spine during the whole life of ob/ob

female mice. Previous studies have shown that leptin receptor
was expressed in cartilaginous skeletal growth centers, articular
cartilage, and osteoblasts (31, 32). Our previous study also
showed that leptin receptor was expressed in the femur and
spinal GP (33). The in situ expression of leptin receptor at the GP
supported that leptin directly affected the GP. GP thickness was
an important histological marker for the longitudinal bone
growth (34). Here, we focused on the GPs and found that the
femoral GP was thinner than that of WT mice, and the spinal GP
was thicker than that of WT mice. Leptin deﬁciency decreased
the proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone height in the
femoral GP compared with the WT mice, but the ratio of
hypertrophic/proliferative zone was higher in ob/ob mice. The
contrasting GP patterns of the femur and vertebrae were in line
with the general femoral and spinal length observation. As we
know, endochondral ossiﬁcation was the major process that
contributed to skeletal bone longitudinal growth (9). During
this procedural transition from cartilage to bone, the potential
abilities of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy were
important for GP thickness and were further responsible for
longitudinal bone growth (35). Chondrocytes in different phases
of GP secreted unique matrix proteins. Collagen II and aggrecan
were used as the markers of GP cellular proliferation. Meanwhile,
collagen X and MMP13 were the typical features of GP

hypertrophy (36–38). The results of our study demonstrated that
leptin deﬁciency decreased the expression of extracellular matrix
marker proteins in femur GP as compared with those in the WT
mice, which was in line with the results of Tuner and colleagues
(28). Interestingly, the extracellular matrix makers were at a
higher level in the spinal GP as compared with those in the spinal
GP of WT mice and the femur GP of ob/ob mice. Collectively,
the results of the extracellular matrix maker expression patterns
in femoral and spinal GP support the contrasting phenotypes in
bone growth of the limb and spine.

To explore the mechanism of this interesting phenomenon,
we further focused on the expression of ERs in the femoral and
spinal GP. Estrogen was a key hormone in puberty of female
mammals, and it was also an important factor that may inﬂuence
the process of skeletal bone line growth (36). ERs mediated
cellular response of estrogen, and previous studies using different
global ER knock-out mouse models have suggested that ERa and
ERb presented opposing effects on longitudinal bone growth in
female mice (20, 22, 39). ERb knock-out adult mice have
increased skeletal length compared with WT female mice,
while ERa knock-out mice presented decreased longitudinal
bone growth (20, 22). A previous study has shown that the
expression level of ERs (especially ERa) was high at the arcuate
nucleus in ob/ob mice (40). Furthermore, in our previous studies
(24, 25), there were cross-talk effects between leptin and ERs
in vitro. However, no reports have been focused on the
expression pattern of ERs located at the spinal and femoral GP
in ob/ob mice in vivo. In the present study, our data ﬁrst showed
that the expression level of ERa was lower in the femoral GP of
ob/ob mice compared with the WT mice, and the level of ERa
was higher in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice compared with WT
mice or the femoral GP of ob/ob mice. In addition, there were no
signiﬁcant changes in ERb located at the femoral and spinal GP.
ERa was considered as a growth promoter in the skeletal
development (20, 39). These interesting ﬁndings of our study
may partially explain the mechanisms of contrasting phenotypes
in bone growth of limb and spine. Low expression of ERa in
femoral GP resulted in short limbs, and high expression of ERa
in spinal GP resulted in long vertebrae. The expression level of
ERa was positively correlated with axial and appendicular bone
length according to the results of Spearman’s analysis.
Furthermore, ER antagonists were used to determine the role
of ERa in regulating the longitudinal bone growth. In line with
our previous study (23), the present data showed that ERa
blocking directly resulted in decreasing appendicular
longitudinal growth, whereas ERb blocking led to increasing
appendicular longitudinal growth in the WT mice. However,
selective ER antagonists did not present regulative effects on the
longitudinal growth of the ob/ob mice. Taken together, our
results show that leptin deﬁciency directly induced the
different expression patterns of ERa at femoral and vertebral
GP and low serum estradiol level in ob/ob mice during puberty,
and the regulative effects of ER antagonists were disturbed by the
absence of leptin. Given the complex effects of leptin deﬁciency
in regulating the bone growth, more speciﬁc mechanisms are
needed to be explored.
In conclusion, we found that leptin deﬁciency presented
contrasting phenotypes in axial and appendicular growth of
ob/ob mice at the end of puberty, with reduced level of
proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral GP and an
increased level of these markers in spinal GP. Furthermore, we
ﬁrst found a signiﬁcant change of expression of ERa located at
femoral and spinal GP (lower in femoral GP and higher in spinal
GP as compared with that in WT mice). These ﬁndings suggested
that region-speciﬁc expression of ERa might be associated with
the formation of contrasting phenotypes of axial and
appendicular bone growth in the ob/ob mice. However, further
studies are needed to clarify the relation between ERs and leptin
in regulating endochondral ossiﬁcation.
