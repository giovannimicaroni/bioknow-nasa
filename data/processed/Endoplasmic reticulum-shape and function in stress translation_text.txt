The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a very versatile organelle.
Besides its major role as the gateway to the secretory pathway
the ER is central to adaptation against abiotic and biotic stress.
Here, we summarize the current knowledge on ER dynamics and
architecture, the association and interaction of the ER with other
organelles as well as its role in stress translation and adaptation
(Figure 1).
The ER is a dynamic network of membrane tubules and sheets.
Movement of the ER along the actin cytoskeleton has a signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence on both its architecture and dynamics. Members
of class XI myosin motor proteins have recently been shown
to control the movement of the ER and other organelles such
as Golgi bodies, peroxisomes and mitochondria. Grifﬁng et al.
(2014) explore a subset of class XI myosins with a focus on their
role in regulating ER network remodeling by affecting ER tubula-
tion, sheet formation and the persistence of these structures. In
addition to the importance of these ER network dynamics for
organelle communication, the ER may further directly provide
the source membrane for vacuole biogenesis, as hypothesized by
Viotti (2014). The majority of soluble vacuolar proteins travel
from the ER to the Golgi complex. A growing number of reports
however indicate that some proteins, including some vacuolar
membrane proteins appear to reach the vacuole without visiting
intermediate compartments of the endomembrane system.
An essential function of the ER is the synthesis of secreted pro-
teins. To insure that only correctly folded proteins are exported
from the ER, eukaryotes have evolved ER quality control (ERQC)
mechanisms, which supervise the folding process. Protein folding
is monitored through the stepwise modiﬁcation of oligosaccha-
ride side chains on glycoproteins, and proteins that fail to fold
correctly are extracted from the folding process and subjected to
ER associated degradation (ERAD). Li and Liu (2014) describe
the protein folding process and how client proteins are cho-
sen for ERAD. Proper function of the ER is particular relevant
under stress where the demand for secreted proteins exceed the
ER working load capacity. Under such conditions, ER home-
ostasis requires cellular communication between the ER and
the nucleus. Therefore, eukaryotes have signaling proteins on
the ER membrane that sense impaired ER function (ER stress)
through the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and
that employ different strategies to signal the nucleus. Some of
these communication strategies are common to all eukaryotes,
while others are unique to plants. Ruberti and Brandizzi (2014)
compare the ER stress signal pathways between yeast, plants and
animals and review the responses in plants, which vary from
adaptive measures to cell death. The bZIP transcription factor
bZIP28 represents an ER stress signaling factor that is tethered

Brandizzi et al.
Endoplasmic reticulum and stress translation
to the ER membrane under unstressed conditions but is mobi-
lized and transferred to the nucleus upon stress. Srivastava et al.
(2014) describe the structure of bZIP28 and underlying principles
of bZIP28 mobilization in response to stress.
ER stress activates the unfolded proteins response (UPR) and
the ERAD system to eliminate misfolded proteins, which is vital
for the establishment of an effective immune system. Tintor and
Saijo (2014) introduce the signiﬁcance of the ERQC in the syn-
thesis of immune receptors and provide further insights into the
causalities of ER function (UPR) and plant immunity. Despite its
role in immunity, the ER has been hijacked by viruses to pro-
mote viral pathogenesis. As reviewed by Verchot (2014), viruses
have developed sophisticated strategies to overload the ER pro-
tein folding machinery with viral encoded proteins in infected
cells. Interestingly, this activates the UPR and up-regulates cel-
lular chaperones that further aid in virus protein folding. The
overall signiﬁcance of the ER in stress adaption is however
apparent and underlined by the review of Nakano et al. (2014)
which, in addition to the biogenesis and evolution, discusses the
putative function of ER bodies in abiotic and biotic stress. As
ER-derived compartments ER bodies contain stress-associated
proteins (e.g., various β-glucosidases of the PYK10 family) that
are thought to enhance stress resilience by activating glucosi-
nolates and glucosylated phytohormones. The study of Höwing
et al. (2014) further identiﬁed an immune-active function of the
ER-localized cysteine endopeptidase AtCEP1. In addition to its
function in developmental processes, AtCEP1 is expressed and
localized to the ER network, which condenses around haustoria
during powdery mildew infection. Knockout of AtCEP1 results
in enhanced susceptibility, suggesting that AtCEP1 is involved
in restricting fungal infection, possibly by controlling a defense-
related programmed cell death (PCD) at the late stages of the
interaction.
Cells mount adaptive responses (e.g., UPR) to mitigate the
damage caused by ER stress. However, when stress becomes so
excessive that the ERQC system cannot meet the demands, then
PCD ensues. Williams et al. (2014) review the possible links
between the UPR and PCD and discuss the involvement of cal-
cium signaling and N-rich proteins in promoting PCD and the
role of ER chaperones in limiting it as well as the connection of
pathogens to ER-mediated cell death. Cai et al. (2014) ﬁnally com-
pare the activation and/or regulation of ER stress-induced PCD in
animals and plants and highlight the signiﬁcance of caspase and
caspase-like activities in underlying PCD processes.
The articles published in this e-book summarize our cur-
rent knowledge of the multi-functionality of the ER in stress
adaptation. By providing a stable microenvironment for the syn-
thesis of metabolites and secreted proteins, the ER functions as
an intracellular stress sensory organelle and, accordingly, initi-
ates and regulates adaptive responses to environmental stress.
Understanding the molecular basis of these processes and the
role of ER architectural dynamics therein is of high relevance for
sustainable crop production. We hope our e-book will stimulate
research in the ﬁeld to further enhance our knowledge of ER
biology in plants.
