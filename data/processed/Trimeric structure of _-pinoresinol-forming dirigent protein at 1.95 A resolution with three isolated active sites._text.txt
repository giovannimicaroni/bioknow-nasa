Background: Dirigent protein (DP) discovery gave new paradigm for monolignol-derived coupling in planta.
Results: ()-Pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) three-dimensional structure was obtained at 1.95 Å resolution.
Conclusion: The tightly packed trimeric DP has three putative substrate binding sites spatially far apart, suggesting that each
site involves monomer coupling directly.
Significance: New insights into monolignol radical-radical coupling in planta.
Control over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions in
vivo in vascular plants was enigmatic until our discovery of diri-
gent proteins (DPs, from the Latin dirigere, to guide or align).
The first three-dimensional structure of a DP (()-pinoresinol-
forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group
H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric struc-
turewithaneight-stranded-barreltopologyforeachDPmono-
mer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling
site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for inter-
molecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site
enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl
alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly,
there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording
either the ()- or ()-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative
binding site and region known to control stereoselectivity. DPs
are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas dirigent domains/
sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.
In terrestrial vascular plants, monolignol coupling affords
the lignans (1), as well as the polymeric structural lignins (2),
with the latter being the most abundant plant biopolymers next
to cellulose. The former are, however, a very diverse class of
vascular plant natural products, typically dimers and/or higher
oligomers, whose physiological roles in planta are considered
mainly involved in plant defense, particularly in leaf, (heart)-
wood, knot, and seed coat tissues. Many lignans are optically
active and can have diverse coupling modes, although the 8–8
interunit (dimer) linkage is perhaps the most commonly
encountered (1). Some are also medicinally important, such as
podophyllotoxin, or its semi-synthetic derivatives, etoposide,
teniposide, and Etopophos widely used in cancer therapies (1).
The entry point into presumed phenoxy radical-radical cou-
pling to the 8–8 lignan class involves one electron oxidation of
the monolignol, e.g. coniferyl alcohol (Fig. 1A, 1), which in the
presence of a specific type of dirigent protein (DP; from the
Latin dirigere, to guide or to align)2 (3), can undergo distinct
forms of stereoselective coupling to afford either the ()- or the
()-antipode of pinoresinol (Fig. 1A, 2a or 2b) (1, 3–6). Mech-
anistically, one electron oxidation (e.g. catalyzed by laccases,
peroxidases) is envisaged to generate the corresponding
coniferyl alcohol (1)-derived free radical intermediate (CA),
which then binds to the DPs. Bound substrate orientation sub-
sequently occurs in such a way as to enable 8–8 coupling at the
si-si face with concomitant intramolecular cyclization to afford
()-pinoresinol (Fig. 1A, 2a), such as in Forsythia intermedia
(3), Thuja plicata (4), Schizandra chinensis (5), or pea (Pisum
sativum) (7), or alternatively re-re coupling to give the ()-
antipode (Fig. 1A, 2b) as in Arabidopsis (1, 5, 6) and flax (Linum
usitatissimum).3 Of these, the ()-pinoresinol-forming DP in
pea is annotated as PsDRR206 (9), and the ()-pinoresinol-
forming DP in Arabidopsis thaliana is named AtDIR6 (5).
In this investigation, determination of the x-ray crystal struc-
ture of the ()-pinoresinol-forming DP PsDRR206 is reported.
These results are discussed with regard to previously proposed
mechanisms for DP-mediated CA coupling (10) and a pub-
lished homology model of AtDIR6 (11), as well as existing x-ray
structures of allene oxide cyclase (AOC) (12, 13). AOC is a plant
enzyme that forms 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, an intermediate
in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, from a reactive allene oxide
precursor, 12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate (14). AOC
shares distant sequence similarity to DPs.

PCR amplification with gene specific primers (DRR206 for-
ward, ATGGGTTCCAAACTTCTAGTACTA, and DRR206
reverse, TTACCAACACTCAAAGAACTTGAT). Vector con-
struction and transformation were carried out using biolistic
bombardment technology as described by Seneviratne et al. (7),
as was expression and purification of the ()-pinoresinol-
forming PsDRR206 recombinant DP in tomato cell culture.
Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Initial crystalli-
zation conditions for the PsDRR206 protein were obtained
using the microbatch under oil method employing 1536-well
microassay plate high throughput screening (15) at the Haupt-
man Woodward Institute (Buffalo, NY). Four conditions from
preliminary screening produced microcrystals: condition 265,
0.1 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M CAPS pH 10, PEG8000 20% (v/v); con-
dition 1006, 0.1 M NH4Br, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8, PEG 400 40% (v/v);
condition 1077, 5% 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetra-
fluoroborate (w/v), 0.09 M Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.8, and 27%
PEG 3350; and condition 1474, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M NaOAc, pH
5.0, PEG 400 80% (w/v). Initial “hits” were scaled up in-house as
hanging drop vapor diffusion methods on VDX 24-well plates
(Hampton Research, CA) incubated at 22 °C with a drop size of
3 l consisting of equal volumes of protein at a concentration of
4–5 mg/ml in 40 mM MES, pH 5, 20 mM Na2SO4, 20% glycerol,
and reservoir solution. Each drop was equilibrated against a
500-l reservoir and monitored periodically. Crystallization
conditions were further optimized using grid screening. Dif-
fraction quality crystals were obtained from the final optimized
crystallization condition 1077, comprising 4% 1-butyl-2,3-di-
methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (w/v), 0.1 M Bis-Tris pro-
pane, pH 7.8, and 35% PEG 3350. Crystals appeared within
5–10 days and grew to the size of 170  170  150 m within 10
weeks. The PsDRR206 crystals were subsequently flash cooled
in a cryoprotectant crystallization buffer, stored in cryovials,
and shipped to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light-
source for data collection.
Native PsDRR206 crystals, diffracting to 1.95 Å resolution,
belong to the rhombohedral space group H32 (see Table 1). A
complete data set comprising 600 images with a rotation angle
of 0.2° was collected from a single PsDRR206 crystal on Stan-
ford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource Beamline BL12-2
using x-rays at 12,658 eV (0.98093 Å) and a PILATUS 6 M PAD
detector running in the shutterless mode. The data were pro-
cessed with XDS (16) and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4
suite of programs (17). The Matthews coefficient (18) assuming
two molecules in the asymmetric unit was 2.0 Å3/Da (39% sol-
vent content). The final data collection statistics are given in
Table 1 (19).
Data Processing, Structure Determination, and Refinement—
PsDRR206 structure was solved by molecular replacement
using the homology model generated for the ()-pinoresinol-
forming DP AtDIR6 from A. thaliana (PM0078038 (11)), which
was derived from an x-ray structure of A. thaliana AOC2
(AtAOC2; PDB code 2BRJ (12)). The sequences of PsDRR206
and AtDIR6 were aligned and the AtDIR6 model was converted
into a pseudo-DRR206 model using the program CHAINSAW
(20) from the CCP4 suite (17). Identical residues in the two
sequences were retained, and those that differed were trun-
cated at the C atom. A weak molecular replacement solution,
with a weighted R factor of 0.61, and a score of 0.42 was
obtained with the program MOLREP (21). This solution was
refined for 15 cycles using REFMAC (22) giving crystallo-
graphic R factor and Rfree values of 0.48 and 0.54, respectively,
and 2Fo  Fc and Fo  Fc electron density maps were calculated.
Inspection of the electron density showed that the molecular
replacement solution was correct, with side chains truncated by
CHAINSAW clearly visible in the 2Fo  Fc and Fo  Fc maps.
Refinement of PsDRR206 structure was completed with the
PHENIX suite of programs (23) and manual building of the
model using the molecular graphics program COOT (24).
Water molecules were added at structurally and chemically rel-
evant positions, and the atomic displacement parameters for all
atoms in the structure were refined isotropically. The final
refinement statistics are given in Table 1.
Atomic coordinates and structure factors for PsDRR206
were deposited to the Protein Data Bank (25) with PDB code
4REV. Superpositions were performed using the SSM proce-
dure (26) as implemented in COOT (24) and the program
LSQKAB in the CCP4 suite (17). The figures were generated
using PyMOL (27). The surface topography was analyzed with
CASTp (28) using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Conserved residues
were mapped onto the structure using ConSurf (29).
Computational Docking Experiments—PsDRR206 and two
ligands were prepared in AutoDockTools4 (30) with default
bonded and nonbonded parameters. One ligand approximated
the coniferyl alcohol quinone methide radical (CA), with C7
and C8 set to be trivalent, trigonal planar carbon atoms copla-
nar with the ring carbon and quinone oxygen atoms. A second
ligand was the 8–8 linked bis-quinone methide. Both syn and
anti isomers, referring to the relationship between C8 and the
methoxyl group, were used in the docking experiments, and
rotation about the C7-C8 bond was not allowed in CA, reflect-
ing its partial double bond character in the resonance hybrid.
Flexibility was allowed for the side chains of residues Asp40,
Phe79, Tyr101, Ser111, Leu113, Ile161, Thr163, and Leu174. The grid
box was centered upon the ligand with sufficient size to cover
the ligand, and all flexible residues and a grid spacing of 0.375 Å.
Autodock Vina (31) was used to perform the docking
calculations.
Homology Modeling—Homology models of AtDIR6 were
built in SWISS-MODEL (32).
RESULTS
Fungally challenged pea (P. sativum) pods have an overall
non-host disease response that includes induction of a gene
called PsDRR206 (Disease Resistance Response 206), whose pro-
tein biochemical function until recently (7) was unknown (33–
35). PsDRR206 shares 54% sequence identity with AtDIR6 over
the extent of the mature polypeptide. For its study in vitro,
recombinant PsDRR206 was constitutively expressed using the
strong CaMV 35S promoter of pART17 (5). Large scale (3 liters)
suspension culture of transformed tomato (Solanum peruvia-
num) cells was obtained by gradually increasing the culture
volume (starter volume, 40 ml) with fresh liquid medium for 4
weeks at weekly subculturing intervals. Proteins were isolated
using a series of strong cationic column chromatographic steps

(7) with 400 g of PsDRR206 protein obtained from the 3-li-
ter culture.
Detailed biochemical characterization next established it to
be a ()-pinoresinol-forming DP (7), and a homologue to our
much earlier discovery of this protein type and its physiological
function from Forsythia species (3). Thus we have now discov-
ered DPs producing both pinoresinol antipodes, with the recent
discovery of a ()-pinoresinol-forming DP in Arabidopsis
(AtDIR6) (1, 5). Interestingly, the function of AtDIR6 was
also reported independently by others (6). Of the various
DPs under investigation thus far, however, crystallization
conditions have only been identified for PsDRR206, the
focus of this investigation.
Overall Structure—PsDRR206 structure was solved by
molecular replacement and refined at 1.95 Å resolution (Table
1). The asymmetric unit contains two independent molecules
related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold rotation axis and con-
nected by a single salt bridge between Glu169 and Arg173. Mol-
ecule A comprises residues 28–43, 65–105, 110–135, 138–
166, and 169–184, whereas molecule B contains residues
28–42, 66–104, 109–135, 138–166, and 168–184 (see PDB
code 4REV for details). Superposition of the two independent
molecules gives a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.4 Å
for 124 matching C atoms. The structure of the PsDRR206
monomer (Fig. 2A) can be best described as an eight-stranded
antiparallel -meander forming a -barrel. The displacement
(shear number) at the suture between 1 and 8, caused by
twisting of the -sheet, is ten residues. The gaps in the structure
correspond to the seven N-terminal residues and loops
between strands 1–2, 3–4, 5–6a, and 7–8. In all of
these gaps, the electron density was either very weak or missing
completely, such that the residues in the loops could not be
fitted. Interestingly, the four missing loops are all at one end of
the -barrel, designated here as the top of the molecule (Fig. 2,
A and B). N-Linked glycans assumed to be present at Asn50 and
Asn120 in PsDRR206 based on their occurrence at the equiva-
lent residues in AtDIR6 (11) are also missing in the electron
density map.
Alternatively, the -barrel can be viewed as two highly
curved anti-parallel sheets formed by strands 2, 3, 4, and 5
(-sheet 1) and by strands 6, 7, 8, and 1 (-sheet 2) (Fig.
2B), respectively. Moreover, strand 6 is divided into two
shorter strands such that the first part of the strand (6a) forms
the outer strand of -sheet 2, whereas the C-terminal end (6b)
adds a fifth strand to -sheet 1. The bifurcation of 6 occurs at
a -bulge at residues Val145-Thr146; a similar bulge is present at
the equivalent position in AOC.
Analysis of the crystal symmetry shows that PsDRR206
forms a tightly packed trimer, with the trimer axis being orien-
tated along the 3-fold axis of the H32 space group (Fig. 3). Nev-
ertheless, formation of the trimer buries almost 2500 Å2 of sur-
face per monomer and over 30% of the total surface of each
monomer. Calculation of the electrostatic surface of the
PsDRR206 monomer shows that the outer surface is hydro-
philic (left side of Fig. 4A), whereas the inner surface involved in
trimer interface formation is predominantly hydrophobic (Fig.
4A, right side, and B). Along with a large number of hydropho-
bic contacts at the trimer interface, the monomers are also held
together by six hydrogen bonding interactions (three for each
monomer-monomer pair), and two electrostatic interactions
(not shown). Inspection of the trimer shows that the loop
between the first two strands is involved in a domain-swapping
event (Fig. 3B), wherein the loop does not simply reverse direc-
tion and become the second -strand in the same monomer.
Instead, it traverses the interface into the neighboring mono-
mer, such that the N-terminal half of the first strand 2 is
inserted into the second monomer next to its strand 2 (Fig. 3,
A and B), adding a sixth strand to -sheet 1. The electron den-

sity in this region clearly shows the N-terminal extension of this
strand (Fig. 3C). This extension of strand 2 provides an addi-
tional nine hydrogen bonds, which include seven main chain
interactions with strand 2 from the second monomer and two
interactions with side chain atoms from the 2-3 loop (Fig.
3C).
At the top of each barrel and slightly toward the outside of
the trimer is a substantial pocket lined mostly with hydropho-
bic residues (Figs. 4C and 5, A and B). Several conserved resi-
dues cluster around this pocket including strictly conserved
charged polar residues Asp40 and Arg141 (Fig. 5A). This narrow
pocket is approximately 12 Å deep, 12 Å wide, and 5 Å across.
The solvent excluded molecular surface area (Connolly surface)
of the pocket is 339 Å2, and its volume is 463 Å3.
Adjacent to Asp40 and on the opposite side of the -sheet is
found His39, one of three conserved residues in an unusual clus-
ter of highly conserved residues that also includes Thr84 and
Ser91. The latter two residues occur in an omega loop between
strands 2 and 3 that folds back upon the exterior of the barrel
(Figs. 2B and 5A). An omega loop is a nonregular secondary
structure element characterized by a loop of varying structure
with its N and C termini located on adjacent secondary struc-
ture elements, typically -strands, close together in space (36).
Comparison of PsDRR206 to AOC—A Dali search of the PDB
(37) identified several -barrel proteins as being closely related
to PsDRR206, including AOC (the first nine hits with Z scores
ranging from 12.1 to 11.5), followed by five proteins of
unknown function (PDB codes 2Q03, 3G7G, 2OOJ, 3C5O, and
4PUX) with Z scores between 10.5 and 7.8. Unlike AOC, these
latter proteins do not form trimeric structures. The Dali search
also identified numerous structures from the avidin/streptavi-
din fold family, but all with Z scores less than 7.0. Like AOC,
these are eight-stranded -barrel proteins with shear number
10; however, they meander in the opposite direction around the
barrel.
A structure-based sequence alignment of PsDRR206 and the
highest scoring Dali hit, Physcomitrella patens AOC (PpAOC2;
PDB code 4H69) (13) with bound inhibitor, identified 109 res-
idues within spans of 151 and 164 residues in the PsDRR206
and AOC crystal structures, respectively, that could be aligned
with 2.2 Å RMSD for the backbone atoms (Fig. 6, A and B).
Similar alignments can also be generated with AtAOC2 struc-
tures (12). Most of the aligned residues constitute the common
core barrel structure of both proteins, whereas the unaligned
portions are in loops linking -strands. Many of these loops also
have substantial insertions and deletions, relative to their coun-
terparts in the other structure. However, the prominent pocket
or cleft on each PsDRR206 monomer aligns well with its coun-
terpart in the AOC structure. The shapes of the PsDRR206 and
AOC pockets are somewhat similar (Fig. 6A), and their volumes
are also quite similar. The size and length of AOC ligands such
as vernolic acid (PDB code 2DIO) are comparable with pinores-
inol (2).

Computational Docking Studies—Because the putative sub-
strate for PsDRR206 is a reactive radical species, experimental
investigation of the protein-substrate complex is not straight-
forward. Accordingly, computational docking studies were
conducted using the PsDRR206 x-ray structure and models of
both the coniferyl alcohol quinone methide radical (CA) and
the 8–8 bis-quinone methide, with the latter being the puta-
tive intermediate in pinoresinol (2) formation following (CA)
radical coupling prior to cyclization of the furan rings (Fig. 1A).
These docking studies suggest that the binding site can accom-
modate at least one CA (Fig. 7A) and that its dimensions are
appropriate for the long axis to span the distance from Arg141 to
Asp40, with the quinone oxygen and the 9-OH potentially inter-
acting favorably with these charged residues.
DISCUSSION
The study herein obtained the ()-pinoresinol-forming
DP (PsDRR206) in crystalline form, and at 1.95 Å resolution.
In this regard, determination of the PsDRR206 three-dimen-
sional structure, and its analysis suggests that the corre-
sponding trimer has three identical substrate binding sites
that are spatially distributed so that intermolecular coupling
apparently cannot occur between two distinct substrate
binding sites in the trimer model. Furthermore, this trimer
observation is in agreement with our earlier studies (3),
where the Forsythia DP was considered as a 78-kDa trimer
based on gel filtration analyses, in contrast to subsequent
mass spectrometric data obtained, which had suggested a
dimeric protein (38).
As indicated above, we also established that PsDRR206 is an
eight-stranded -barrel with the same -meander topology and
remarkably similar trimeric quaternary structure as AOC.
Together with the previously mentioned low (17% identity),
but likely meaningful, sequence similarity between DP and
AOC protein families, this suggests a possible common ances-
tor for these functionally distinct proteins.
Although there are striking structural similarities between
PsDRR206 and AOC, it remains to be seen whether there are
mechanistic similarities as well. Studies of AOC with and with-
out a bound inhibitor suggested that conformational changes in
the binding pocket upon formation of a tight enzyme-substrate
complex precede the catalytic cycle and that steric restrictions
in the active site determine the stereoselectivity of the cycliza-
tion reaction (12, 13). Both of these characteristics could be
seen to be important in a protein guiding stereoselective phe-
noxy radical coupling. Conceivably, the trimeric -barrel
DP/AOC scaffold is well suited for these roles.

DP Surface Features and Patterns of Conserved Residues—
We hypothesize that the prominent outward facing pocket near
the top of each barrel is the substrate binding (active) site
located within the internal cavity of the barrel, based upon com-
parison with the structures and similar dimensions of P. patens
AOC1 and AOC2 with bound substrate analog (PDB codes
4H69 and 4H6B (13)). We further propose that this is the bind-
ing site for one or possibly two coniferyl alcohol phenoxy radi-
cals (CA) in PsDRR206. Conserved residues Thr163 and Phe172
line the edge of the putative binding pocket (Fig. 8, A–D) (29),
and disordered loop residues for which electron density is miss-
ing occur around the edge of the pocket. Two polar residues,
Asp40 and Arg141, conserved in all pinoresinol-forming DPs but
not AOCs, are also located at either end of the pocket (Figs. 5A
and 7A). The span between them is 12–14 Å, suitable for a
single trans coniferyl alcohol molecule or quinone methide rad-
ical, whose lengths are 8–10 Å. Residues in the interior of the
pocket are less conserved, however, possibly because they help
determine substrate specificity.
In PsDRR206, but not AOC, an omega loop consisting of
approximately eight residues (Leu85–Lys92) occurs at the bot-
tom of the trimer between 2 and 3 and folds back upon the
outside of the barrel (Fig. 5A). A cluster of three highly con-
served polar residues (His39, Thr84, and Ser91) also occur (Fig.
8D) where this loop contacts the exterior surface of the barrel.
These three residues are conserved in all characterized ()- and
()-pinoresinol-forming DPs (Fig. 1B), whereas they are not
conserved in AOCs. The cluster adjoins the active site pocket,
and indeed His39 neighbors conserved residue Asp40 in the
putative active site region, although on the opposite side of the
strand in the -barrel (Fig. 5A). This proximity of conserved
residues thus provisionally suggests the omega loop may be the
site of an interaction that modulates either substrate orienta-
tion or binding in the active site. As indicated above, because
the proposed pockets point outwards relative to the trimer axis,
a substrate in one pocket is unlikely to be able to couple with
those in other pockets elsewhere in the trimer.
Another notable residue conserved in DPs, although not in
AOCs, is Phe73 (Tyr in FiDIR and some other DPs), which lies
near its symmetry mates on the exterior surface of the barrel at
its topmost point and near the rim of the putative active site.
This positioning suggests it may serve as a hydrophobic anchor
point (Figs. 5 and 8 (A and B)). Its conservation and location on
the surface suggest it is maintained there by selective pressure.
Because they do not appear likely to be necessary for stabiliza-

tion of the structure, these conserved surface-exposed hydro-
phobic side chains might instead indicate interaction site(s) for
an oxidase, other dirigent proteins, or perhaps even a surface
such as that of an actively growing lignin polymer. Several other
conserved residues in DPs are also found buried in the trimer
interface, supporting the idea that the trimer is the functional
form of this and probably other DPs.

ScDIR and AtDIR6, ()- and ()-pinoresinol-forming DPs,
respectively, were made using the very distantly related AOC
structures as potential templates. The x-ray structure of
PsDRR206, however, now allows construction of accurate
homology models of AtDIR6 (50% amino acid identity to
PsDRR206).
Modeling of missing loop residues permits consideration of
loop regions surrounding the putative active site where weak or
missing electron density prevented fitting of the structure. All
of the known ()-pinoresinol-forming DPs have six more res-
idues in the longest of these loops, between strands 1 and 2
(Leu42 to Gly74 of PsDRR206), than the ()-pinoresinol DPs.
This difference is conserved in various plant species (Fig. 1B).
This correlation with stereoselectivity may indicate a role
for this loop in binding or orientation of the substrate, for
example by acting as a “lid” that closes on the active site as
substrates bind.
Furthermore,thepreciseresiduesessentialfordistinctstereo-
selectivities in PsDRR206 and AtDIR6 were of considerable
interest, because previously this was only narrowed down to the
Region B in the DPs (Fig. 1B) (5). That is, using a region swap-
ping approach, we established regions in the DPs that affected
different stereoselectivities resulting in formation of opposite
antipodes of pinoresinol (2) (5).
Our recent characterization of pea (7) and flax (8) DPs, how-
ever, now expands the number of DPs of known function to
eleven in seven different plant species, namely F. intermedia,
T. plicata, A. thaliana, S. chinensis, Piper regnellii, P. sativum,
and L. usitatissimum. Among them, seven DPs (FiDIR,
TpDIR5, TpDIR8, ScDIR, PrDIR, PsDRR206, and LuDIR1)
afford ()-pinoresinol (2a), whereas four others (AtDIR5,
AtDIR6, LuDIR5, and LuDIR6) generate ()-pinoresinol (2b).
Interestingly, flax has both ()- and ()-pinoresinol-forming
DPs (LuDIR1 versus LuDIR5 and LuDIR63, respectively).
Although previously we had noted 14 residues differentially
conserved in ()- and ()-pinoresinol-forming DPs (5), the
recent identification of pea and flax DPs enabled us to narrow
down candidate residues further to six. These now include
Gly95, Leu113, Phe115, Phe117, Phe130, and Ile/Leu161 in the ()-
pinoresinol-forming DPs (numbering is based on PsDRR206),
as well as Ala98, Phe116, Tyr118, Leu120, Ile133, and Phe164 in the
()-pinoresinol-forming DPs; the numbering is based on
AtDIR6 (Fig. 1B, with residues marked with green dots). Inter-
estingly, except for Ile161 of PsDRR206 (and Phe164 in the ()-
pinoresinol-forming DP), all of these residues are located in
Region-B (Lys90–Leu138 of AtDIR6) that was previously found
responsible for altered stereoselectivity by region swapping (5).
Furthermore, residues Leu113 and Phe115 of PsDRR206 (Phe116
and Tyr118 of AtDIR6) are located within the putative active site
region (Fig. 5, A and B), with both residues being on the 4
strand and having their side chains positioned at distances less
than 10 Å to the conserved polar residues Asp40 and Arg141; the
latter provisionally appears to be positioned in a way that could
determine whether the si or re face of bound CA is exposed and
available for coupling. Accordingly, in the future, site-directed
mutagenesis will examine whether one or more of the six resi-
dues determine distinct stereoselectivities.
Homology Modeling of the Putative Active Site in ()-Pinores-
inol-forming AtDIR6—The backbone RMSD between PsDRR206
and the published AtDIR6 homology model of Pickel et al. (11)
is 5 Å, varying depending on which residues are superim-
posed. Three -strands are out of register by two residues each
with respect to their counterparts in the experimentally deter-
mined x-ray structure. Although the same side chains occupy
the core of the -barrel, they are misplaced because of incorrect
alignment of neighboring strands. Our own models (5) were
similarly poor. Such results are not unexpected given the low
sequence similarity (17% identity in the core -barrel)
between AtDIR6 and AtAOC2, the template used to generate
the homology model.
Nonetheless, the model of Pickel et al. (11) was sufficient to
obtain a molecular replacement solution for the PsDRR206
crystal structure. This is because the core -barrel of the tem-
plate, AtAOC2 (PDB code 2BRJ) aligns very well with that of
PsDRR206 (RMSD 3.2 Å over 113 residues). The structure has a
RMSD 2.2 Å with P. patens AOC (PpAOC2, PDB code 4H69;
Fig. 6B, which itself has a 1 Å RMSD alignment with AtAOC2).
More specifically, because side chain atoms are not typically
used in finding structure solutions by molecular replacement,
the misalignment of several -strands did not matter in this
instance so long as positions of backbone atoms in the barrel are
not perturbed by the misalignment.
Using the PsDRR206 x-ray structure as a template, a new
homology model of AtDIR6 was thus constructed to investigate
the basis for differing stereoselectivities in pinoresinol-forming
DPs. (Fig. 9). Five of the six residues that are differentially con-
served among ()- and ()-pinoresinol-forming DPs from a
range of plant species cluster together in the deep interior of the
putative active site pocket. A seventh active site residue (Val176
in PsDRR206), not included in the original set because it is
substituted with Thr in one ()-pinoresinol-forming DP,
becomes Met in ()-pinoresinol-forming DPs. These residues
are located opposite each another on either side of the pocket,
in the center of one or the other of the two highly curved anti-
FIGURE 9. AtDIR6 homology model (lavender) generated from the

parallel -sheets that form the -barrel. Other active site resi-
dues nearer the mouth of the pocket are strictly conserved, such
as Asp40, Arg141, and Thr163. We propose that the two different
sets of differentially conserved residues force CA to bind such
that only the si (for ()-pinoresinol (2a)) or the re (for ()-
pinoresinol (2b)) face is exposed and available to couple with a
second CA (or possibly CA), which itself must be oriented
properly, perhaps by residues in the 1-2 loop. Uncovering
specific details of the mechanism, such as the actual roles of
Asp40 and Arg141 and the orientation of each substrate, will
likely require structural characterization of DPs with substrate
or product analogues. Missing residues in loops surrounding
the putative active site at the top of the -barrel were also mod-
eled to establish the range through which their motion can
occur assuming the core barrel structure remains intact (Fig.
10). In particular, the 23 missing residues in the 1-2 loop
span a distance of 32 Å, conceivably providing ample poten-
tial to adopt a range of conformations.
Mechanistic Considerations—The trimeric DP structure
shows that each active site is isolated from the others and will
not allow two substrates bound at two different active sites to
interact. In light of this finding, the most likely mechanism is
that a single active site binds two substrates that combine to
form product. The putative PsDRR206 binding pocket would
thus bind two CA in an orientation allowing si-si coupling to
form the ()-pinoresinol antipode (2a), whereas the homo-
logue AtDIR6 would afford the corresponding ()-enantiomer
(2b) through re-re coupling. However, a variation in which one
CA and one coniferyl alcohol (1) bind and react cannot be ruled
out.
Docking studies (Fig. 7) suggested that two CA substrates
could bind in the active site, as could an 8–8 bis-quinone
methide (Fig. 1A). Although two positions of the methoxy
group (syn or anti) with respect to C8 are possible in the qui-
none methide, discrimination of si and re faces that determine
the stereochemistry at C8/8 in pinoresinol (2) does not require
the methoxy group to be in one position or the other. After the
bis-quinone methide is formed, each of the 9/9 -OH groups
could nucleophilically attack the C7/C7 quinone methide moi-
eties to form the pinoresinol furanofuran product. Both cycli-
zations apparently occur stereospecifically, with no rotation
about C7-C8, because this would instead lead to 7-epi-pinores-
inol (or bis 7-epi-pinoresinol if a 180° rotation about both
C7-C8 bonds occurred). This suggests that the bis-quinone
methide intermediate is not released from the active site and
that both substrates are bound such that both 8–8 coupling
and C7-O9 and C7-O9 ring closure occur in the bound state.
Pinoresinol (2) formation probably concludes with proton-
ation of the quinone oxygen after rearomatization to form a
phenol. Residue Asp40 in the putative binding pocket could be
the source of this proton. Alternatively, if CA is bound in the
opposite lengthwise orientation, the positively charged side
chain of Arg141 could stabilize the quinone form of the phenolic
oxygen in CA, helping to localize the radical at C8 and favor
coupling there. Indeed, binding in either orientation potentially
provides ample opportunity for -stacking interactions with
aromatic residues in the active site (Fig. 7B). Asp40 and Arg141
are conserved in all DPs, whereas AOC does not have the cor-
responding residues, suggesting that they are required for sub-
strate binding and activity specific to DPs, rather than for struc-
tural stability.
The 2-fold rotational symmetry of the pinoresinol molecule
may have helped shape previous hypotheses (10, 11) for the
mechanism of its formation involving a DP dimer with a single
CA substrate bound to each monomer. The structure pre-
sented here is not consistent with such a mechanism, without
invocation of a substrate-induced head to head joining of two
trimers, for which there is currently no evidence.
Interestingly, in addition to stereoselective control over
monolignol coupling in lignan biosynthesis, another study has
also reported DP domain involvement in lignification in the
root Casparian strip (39). Although this is in conceptual agree-
ment with our earlier considerations of DPs and proteins har-
boring dirigent (substrate binding) sites/domains for lignan
biosynthesis and lignification (8, 40), respectively, it must be
emphasized that most DPs still await discovery of their true
physiological functions, as well as in terms of chemical struc-
tural and in vitro function analyses. In due course, we will
obtain definitive mechanistic models for substrate binding, ori-
entation, coupling, intramolecular cyclization, and product
release.
