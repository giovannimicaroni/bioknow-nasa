The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the
impact of spaceﬂight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were col-
lected from four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3
days), during (Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82,
R + 194 days) spaceﬂight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The
collection process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot
cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule
HEPA ﬁlter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to
obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were
shipped to our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and
biobanking. This paper provides an overview of the extensive biospecimen
collection and highlights their processing procedures and long-term bio-
banking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As
such, this study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-
quality human, microbial, and environmental samples for aerospace medicine
in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can aid future
human spaceﬂight and space biology experiments.
Our human space exploration efforts are at a unique transition point in
history, with more crewed launches and human presence in space than
ever before1. We can attribute this to the commercial spaceﬂight sector
entering an industrial renaissance, with multiple companies forming
collaborative and competitive networks to send commercial astro-
nauts into space. The recent advancements in human space explora-
tion offer a signiﬁcant chance to gather more biological research
samples and enhance our comprehension of spaceﬂight’s effects on

human health. This is vital, asour knowledge of the biological reactions
to the unique environment of space, marked by microgravity and the
space radiation, remains incomplete2. The impact of spaceﬂight on
human health includes musculoskeletal deconditioning3, cardiovas-
cular adaptations4, vision changes5, space motion sickness6, neuro-
vestibular changes7, immune dysfunction8, and increased risk of rare
cancers9, among other changes2. However, we are still at the initial
stages of documenting biological responses to spaceﬂight exposure at
the molecular and cellular resolution.
Prior work has characterized molecular changes that occur
during spaceﬂight in astronauts. These include changes in cytokine
proﬁles8,10,11, urinary albumin abundance12, and hemolysis13. Further-
more, multiomic assays have provided genomic maps of structural
changes in DNA14–16, RNA expression proﬁles11,17,18, sample-wide pro-
tein measurements17,19,20, and metabolomic status17. Additionally,
International Space Station (ISS) surfaces have been studied with
longitudinal microbial proﬁles to track microbial pathogenicity and
evolution to assess their potential inﬂuence on crew health21,22. To
better improve our understanding of both human and microbial
biology in space, it is critical that these analyses continue and expand
as more spacecraft and stations are built and ﬂown.
Combining and comparing work from prior missions in these new
spacecraft and stations is especially important to overcome the small
sample sizes and highlights a need for standardization between mis-
sions. In addition, recruiting large cohorts of astronauts is difﬁcult, as
the ISS typically can only house up to six astronauts at a time. As of the
time of writing, only 647 humans have been to space, starting with the
launch of Yuri Gagarin in 1961. Studies have spanned the Vostok pro-
gram, Project Mercury, the Voskhod program, Project Gemini, Project
Apollo, the Soyuz program, the Salyut space stations, MIR, the Space
Shuttle Program, SkyLab, Tiangong Space Station, and the ISS. From the
breadth of experiments that have been performed on the ISS, only a
minority have speciﬁcally been human research-oriented23,24, and just a
subset involve omics studies. The NASA Twin Study created the most in-
depth multi-omic study of astronauts prior to Inspiration4, but was
limited to one astronaut and one ground control17. These factors have
limited the statistical power of astronaut omic experiments and
increased the difﬁculty of providing robust scientiﬁc conclusions.
Standardizing biospecimen collections across multiple missions will
create larger sample sets needed to draw these conclusions.
Here, we establish the standard biospecimen sample collection and
banking procedures for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA). A
key goal of SOMA is to standardize biospecimen collection and pro-
cessing for spaceﬂight, to generate high-quality multi-omics data across
spaceﬂight investigations, and to enable follow-up experiments with
viably frozen cells and biobanked samples. This paper provides sample
collection methods built for standardized ﬁeld collections across dif-
ferent crews and missions. We cover the decentralized sample collec-
tion process from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission from the point of
collection to the preservation of samples for downstream biochemical
and omics processing at our centralized lab at Weill Cornell Medicine
(WCM). These protocols can produce synchronized datasets with
enhanced statistical strength, amplifying our scientiﬁc ﬁndings from
spaceﬂight studies. Additionally, we showcase metrics related to sample
collection outputs, references of past astronaut sample collections in
scientiﬁc publications, and suggestions to reﬁne sample collection for
upcoming missions. In its inaugural use case, these samples were col-
lected from the I4 astronaut cohort and are currently in use for several
other missions (Polaris Dawn, Axiom-2), which will enable continued
utilization for future crewed space missions.
Results
Biospecimen collection overview
We formulated and executed a sampling plan that spans a wide range
of biospecimen samples: venous blood, capillary dried blood spots
(DBSs), saliva, urine, stool, skin swabs, skin biopsies, and environ-
mental swabs (Fig. 1a). The collection of various types of samples
covered the scope of previous assays on astronaut samples (Supple-
mentary Table 1), but also enabled newer omics technologies, such as
spatially resolved, single-molecule, and single-cell assays.
For the I4 mission, sample collection spanned three-time points
pre-launch (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), three-time points during ﬂight (Flight
Day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and four-time points post-return (R + 1, R + 45,
R + 82, R + 194 days). Venous blood, urine, stool, and skin biopsies were
collected during ground timepoints only, while capillary DBSs, saliva,
and skin swabs were collected both on the ground and during ﬂight
(Fig. 1b). Environmental swabs of the Dragon capsule were collected
pre-ﬂight in the crew training capsule and during ﬂight in the space-
craft launched from Cape Canaveral (Fig. 1b).
Samples were collected across a variety of locations based on the
crew’s training and travel schedule. L-92 and L-44 were collected in
Hawthorne, CA at SpaceX Headquarters, L-3 and R + 1 were collected at
Cape Canaveral, FL at a facility near the launch site. FD1, FD2, and FD3
were collected inside the Dragon capsule while in orbit. R + 45 was
collected at the crew members’ individual locations (which spanned
the US States NY, NJ, TN, and WA), R + 82 was collected at Weill Cornell
Medicine, NY and R + 194 was collected at Baylor College of Medicine,
TX (Fig. 1c). All samples from ground timepoints were processed
within 16 hours of collection. All samples from the ﬂight were pro-
cessed immediately after retrieval from the ﬂight.
Samples were stored at −80 °C at each site immediately after
processing and aliquoting (processing steps are outlined below). All
samples were shipped via FedEx using Overnight Shipping to Weill
Cornell Medicine for storage in the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Bio-
bank (CAMbank) within 1 week of collection on dry ice in styrofoam
boxes and spent <2 days in transit. No samples were shipped on a
Thursday or Friday to avoid weekend shipping delays. All samples
arrived at Weill Cornell Medicine with dry-ice still in the packaging and
samples frozen. Samples were immediately transferred to −80 °C for
long-term storage and biobanking. Any exceptions to this process will
be noted below. In total, we collected 2,911 sample aliquots, which
were then processed in our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for
downstream assays (Supplementary Table 2). Some samples were
processed immediately at ﬁeld laboratory facilities (Supplementary
Data Fig. 1). DNA and RNA yields are also reported below from col-
lection kits (saliva and stool) after arrival at WCM.
Blood collection and derivatives
Blood was collected using a combination of venipuncture tubes to
collect venous blood and contact-activated lancets to collect capillary
blood from the ﬁngertip. Each crew member provided blood samples,
collected into one BD PAXgene blood RNA tube (bRNA), four BD
Vacutainer K2 EDTA tubes, two BD Vacutainer cell preparation tubes
(CPTs), one Streck cell-free DNA tube (cfDNA BCT), one BD Vacutainer
serum separator tube (SST), and one DBS card per time point. Tubes
were transported from the collection site to the ﬁeld laboratory at
room temperature. From these tubes, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs,
serum, and cell pellet samples were collected (Supplementary Table 3).
Sample yields are reported below. Samples were aliquoted for long-
term storage and biobanking (Supplementary Table 4).
bRNA tubes were collected in order to isolate total RNA using the
PAXgene blood RNA kit (Fig. 2a). Yield ranged from 3.04 to 14.04 µg/
tube of total RNA across all samples, and the RNA integrity number
(RIN) ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 (mean: 6.95) (Fig. 2b). RNA was stored at
−80 °C after extraction. The collection of total RNA enables a variety of
downstream RNA proﬁling methods. It will allow comparative studies
to prior RNA-sequencing performed on astronauts, particularly
snoRNA & lncRNA biomarkers analyzed from Space Shuttle era
blood25,26, mRNA & miRNA measured during the NASA Twin Study17,18,
and whole blood RNA arrays from the ISS27,28. Additionally, RNA yields

are more than sufﬁcient to perform direct-RNA sequencing using
Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms, which require
500 ng of total RNA per library (Manufacturer’s protocol, ONT kit SQK-
RNA002). This enables the study of RNA modiﬁcation changes during
spaceﬂight to create epitranscriptomic proﬁles for the ﬁrst time in
astronauts.
Four K2 EDTA tubes were drawn at each timepoint from each crew
member (Fig. 2c). One K2 EDTA tube was submitted to Quest Diag-
nostics to perform a complete blood count (CBC, Quest Test Code:
6399). One tube was used to isolate extracellular vesicles and particles
(EVPs) for proteomic quantiﬁcation (Fig. 3a). Total EVP quantities
varied from 2.71-28.27 ug (Fig. 2d). Two K2 EDTA tubes were used to
isolate PBMCs for single-cell sequencing (10X Chromium Single Cell
Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression and Chromium Single Cell Immune
Proﬁling workﬂows). After collection, a Ficoll separation was per-
formed to isolate PBMCs, which ranged from 340,000-975,000 cells
per mL of blood (Fig. 2e). One prior single-cell gene expression
experiment, NASA Twin study, was performed on astronauts, which
found immune cell population speciﬁc gene expression changes and a
correlation with microRNA signatures11,18.
Additional PBMCs, plasma, and serum were collected from CPTs
(Fig. 4a), cfDNA BCTs (Fig. 4d), SSTs (Fig. 4c), as well as red blood cell
pellets. CPTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Fig. 3b). Plasma volume per tube ranged from 3000-
14,000 uL per tube (Fig. 4d). Because of technical issues in the sample
processing procedure, three instances occurred where plasma retrie-
valfrom the CPT tubes was not possible. Plasma can be used to validate
or refute previous studies, including cytokine panel10,29, exosomal
RNA-seq25,26, extracellular vesicle microRNA30, and proteomic20,31–33
results. PBMCs were also collected, aliquoted into 6 cryovials per CPT,
and stored in liquid nitrogen after slowly cooled in a Mr. Frosty to
-80 °C. These can be used to follow-up on previous studies on adaptive

The
remaining red blood cell pellet mixtures from below the gel plug in
each CPT Tube were stored at −20 °C.
cfDNA BCT (Streck) tubes were collected to isolate high-quality
cfDNA from plasma. cfDNA BCTs were spun and aliquoted according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3c). The remaining cell pellet
mixture was frozen at −20 °C. Plasma volume per timepoint ranged
from 1500-5000 uL (Fig. 4e). 500 uL aliquots were frozen at -80 °C.
cfDNA extracted from these tubes can be analyzed for fragment
length, mitochondrial or nuclear origin, and cell type or tissue of
origin40–42.
The SST was spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Fig. 3d). Serum volume ranged from 2000-8000 uL per
timepoint (Fig. 4f). Similar to plasma, serum can be allocated for
cytokine analysis and can also be used to perform comprehensive
metabolic panels, including one we used at Quest (CMP, Quest Test
Code: 10231) for metrics on alkaline phosphatase, calcium, glucose,
potassium, and sodium, among other metabolic markers. The
remaining cell pellet mixture from each SST tube was stored at −20 °C.
In addition to venous blood, capillary blood was collected onto a
DBS card using a contact-activated lancet pressed against the ﬁn-
gertip (Fig. 5a). Capillary blood was collected onto a Whatman 903
Protein Saver DBS card to preserve nucleic acids and proteins. Each
of the ﬁve spots on the DBS card hold 75-80uL of capillary blood,
however, the amount of capillary blood collected across timepoints
varied (Fig. 5b, c) according to how much blood could be collected
before the lancet-puncture closed.
Saliva collection
Saliva was collected at the L-92, L-44, L-3, FD1, FD2, FD3, R + 1, R + 45,
and R + 82 timepoints using two methods. First, saliva was collected
using the OMNIgene Oral Kit (OME-505), which preserves nucleic acids
(Fig. 6a) during the ground timepoints. From these samples, DNA,
RNA, and protein were extracted. DNA yield ranged from 28.1 to
3187.8 ng, RNA yield from 396.0 to 3544.2 ng (less the two samples had
concentrations too low for measurement), and protein concentration
from 92.97 to 93.15 ng.
Second, crude saliva (i.e., saliva with no preservative added) was
collected into a 5 mL DNase/RNase-free screw top tube during the
ground and ﬂight timepoints. Saliva volume varied from 150 to 4000 uL
per tube (Fig. 6b). Crude saliva was also collected during ﬂight (FD2 and
FD3), in addition to the ground timepoints.
Saliva collections have been conducted throughout spaceﬂight
studies for assessing the immune state of crews, particularly in the
context of viral reactivation. Previously identiﬁed viruses that reacti-
vate during spaceﬂight include Epstein–Barr, varicella-zoster, and

cytomegalovirus43. Responses to reactivation of these viruses can be
asymptomatic, debilitating, or even life-threatening, thus assessing
these adaptations is beneﬁcial in understanding viral spaceﬂight
activity as well as crew health. In addition to viral nucleic acid quanti-
ﬁcation, numerous biochemical assays can also be performed,
including measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, dehy-
droepiandrosterone (DHEA), and cytokines, among others10,43–46.
Urine collection
Urine was collected in sterile specimen cups at the L-92, L-44, L-3, R + 1,
R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints. Specimen cups were collected 1-2 times
per day. For preservation, urine was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C.
Half the urine had Zymo Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB) added
before
freezing,
to
preserve
nucleic
acids.
Samples
yielded
23–155.5 mL of crude urine and 21 - 112 mL of UCB urine per specimen
cup (Fig. 7a). Urine was split into 1 mL - 15 mL aliquots before freezing
at -80 °C.
A wide variety of assays can be performed on urine samples.

included

kidney stones54,55, proteomics11, telomere measurements57, and various
biomarkers and metabolites17,49,58–61.
Stool collection
Stool was collected at the L-92, L-44, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 time-
points. Stool samples were stored into two collection containers at
each timepoint, one DNA Genotek OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) kit with
a preservative for metagenomics and another (ME−200) with a pre-
servative for metabolomics (Fig. 7b). Stool was the least consistent
sample collected due to the limited windows available for sampling
during collection timeframes. DNA and RNA were extracted from ali-
quots of the OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) tubes for downstream
microbiome analysis. DNA yield ranged from 358.5 to 16,660 ng, RNA
from 690 to 2010 ng (Fig. 7c). Large variations in yield are attributable
to variable stool mass collected between kits.
Stool samples enable various biochemical, immune, and micro-
biome changes studies. Previous metagenomic assays have found that
shannon alpha diversity and richness during long-duration missions to
the ISS62.
Skin swabs
Body swabs were collected at all timepoints.Samples were collected by
swabbing the body region of interest for 30 seconds, then placing the
swab in a sterile 2D matrix tube (Thermo Scientiﬁc #3710) with Zymo
DNA/RNA shield preservative. For the ﬁrst two swab locations, the oral
and nasal cavity, the swab was placed directly on the body after
removal from its sterile packaging (dry-swab method; Fig. 8a). For the
remaining body locations, the swab was brieﬂy dipped in nuclease-
free, DNA/RNA-free water before proceeding (wet-swab method).
Eight distinct sites were swabbed with the wet-swab method: post-
auricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal
crease, glabella, and the toe-web space (Fig. 8b). The astronaut
microbiome has previously been studied in the forehead, forearm,
nasal, armpit, navel, postauricular, and tongue body locations, and
changes have been documented during ﬂight. Changes in alpha
diversity and beta diversity were documented, as well as shifts in
microbial genera62. However, the impact of these changes on skin
health and immunological health are not well understood.
Acquiring extensive swab samples from the crew skin allows for
characterization of the habitat environment, crew skin microbiome
adaptations, and interactions with potential human health adaptations
resulting from spaceﬂight exposure. This is very relevant for crew health,
considering astronauts become more susceptible to infections during
spaceﬂight missions63, with the relationship between microbe-host
interactions from spaceﬂight exposure, which may be a causative factor
of astronauts immune dysfunction, which is still not well understood.

Skin Biopsies
A skin biopsy on the deltoid was obtained from the L-44 and R + 1
timepoint. Biopsies were also collected in advance of a ﬂight to
ensure the biopsy site is fully healed before the ﬂight so there is no
risk of complication. The wet-swab method was used to collect the
skin microbiome before the skin biopsy. The skin biopsies were 3–4
millimeters in diameter and were collected for histology and
spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) (Fig. 8c). One-third of the
sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to
perform histology. The remaining two-thirds of the sample was
stored in a cryovial and placed at -80 °C for SRT (Fig. 8c). This is the
ﬁrst sample collected from astronauts for spatially resolved tran-
scriptomics. The skin is of high interest due to the inﬂammation-
related cytokine markers such as IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-17A, and IL-1810,17
and skin rash’s status as the most frequent clinical symptom
reported during spaceﬂight64.
Environmental swabs and HEPA ﬁlter
Environmental swabs were collected in ﬂight during the F1 and F2
timepoint. Additionally, environmental swabs were collected from the
ﬂight simulation capsule at SpaceX headquarters after days of crew
training during the L-92 and L-44 timepoints. Environmental swabs
were collected using the wet-swab method. Ten environmental swabs
were collected per time point at the following locations in the capsule:
an ambient air/control swab, the execute button, the viewing dome,
the side hatch mobility aid, the lid of the waste locker, the head section
of one of the seats, the commode panel, the right and left sides of the
control screen, and the g-meter button (Fig. 9a-d). Additionally, the

spacecraft’s high-efﬁciency particulate absorbing (HEPA) ﬁlter was
acquired post-ﬂight. This ﬁlter was cut into 127 rectangular pieces (1.2”
x 1.6” x 4”) and stored at −20 °C.
Previous microbial proﬁling of spacecraft environments has
revealed that equipment sterilized on the ground becomes coated in
microbial life in space due to interactions with crew and the intro-
duction of equipment that has not undergone sterilization65. Sub-
sequent microbial monitoring assays performed on the ISS have
detected novel, spaceﬂight-speciﬁc species on the ISS66. Once in space,
surface microbes are subject to the unique microgravity and radiation
environment of ﬂight, which will inﬂuence evolutionary trajectory. The
potential impact of this inﬂuence on pathogenesis is a concern for
long-duration space missions, especially given that changes in host-
pathogen interactions may also be affected during spaceﬂight67.
Discussion
We report here on biospecimen samples collected from the SpaceX I4
Mission, the most comprehensive human biological specimen collec-
tion effort performed on an astronaut cohort to date. The extensive
archive of biospecimens included venous blood, dried blood spot
cards, saliva, urine, stool, microbiome body swabs, skin biopsies, and
environmental capsule swabs. The study objective was to establish a
foundational set of methods for biospecimen collection and banking
on commercial spaceﬂight missions suitable for multi-omic and
molecular analysis. Biospecimens were collected to enable compre-
hensive, multi-omic proﬁles, which can then be used to develop
molecular catalogs with higher resolution of human responses to
spaceﬂight. Select, targeted measures in clinical labs (CLIA) were also
performed immediately after sample collection (CBC, CMP), and
samples and viable cells were preserved in a long-term Cornell Aero-
space Medicine Biobank, such that additional assays and measures can
be conducted in the future.
Great care was put into the standardization of sample processing
between ﬁeld laboratories in Hawthorne, Cape Canaveral, and Hous-
ton. Despite our best efforts to control for all preanalytical variables68,
there are some inconsistencies in sample processing that were una-
voidable during this mission. Of note, there was no access to cold
stowage during ﬂight, causing all samples to be stowed at room tem-
perature until they arrived back on Earth. Of the three sample types
collected during ﬂight, two were stable at room temperature (skin/
capsule swabs stored in DNA/RNA shield and capillary blood collected
on dried blood spot cards). The third (saliva samples), were not stored
in a preservative and, for this reason, will have a distinct proﬁle com-
pared to other timepoints. This limits the context in which these
samples will be useful, but will still provide biological insights in more
targeted biological studies. We can imagine situations in the future
where there will be tradeoffs between standardization of sample col-
lection with previous missions and mission-speciﬁc constraints inﬂu-
encing the selection of biospecimen collection methods.
However, there are several reasons why rigorous biospecimen
collection methods for commercial and private spaceﬂight missions
must be developed, which are scalable and translational across
populations, missions, and mission parameters. First, little is known
about the biological and clinical responses that occur in civilians
during and after space travel. While professional astronauts are gen-
erally young, healthy, and extensively trained, civilian astronauts have

been, and likely will be, far more heterogeneous. They will possess a
variety of phenotypes, including older ages, different health back-
grounds, and greater medication use, and may experience different
medical conditions, risks, and comorbidities. Careful molecular char-
acterization will be beneﬁcial for the development of appropriate
baseline metrics and countermeasures and, therefore, beneﬁcial for
the individual spaceﬂight experience. In the future, such analyses may
enable precision medicine applications aimed at optimizing counter-
measures for each individual astronaut who enters and returns safely
from space69,70.
Second, multi-omic studies inherently present a large number of
measurements within a small set of subjects. These high-dimensional
datasets present numerous potential challenges with regard to the
ampliﬁcation of noise, risk of overﬁtting, and false discoveries71. At all
times, scientists engaged in multi-omic analyses must take special care
that true biological variance is what has been measured. The intro-
duction of experimental variance through the progression from sam-
ple collection, transport, and storage, to sequencing and analysis can
introduce artifacts of variance that render the detection of true bio-
logical variance and interpretation of results more difﬁcult. For this
reason, tight adherence to experimental controls or annotation at
every step of the experimental condition is crucial. Careful annotation
allows for the assignment of class variables in post hoc analysis. Among
such applications are the attempt to detect batch effects or determine
the impact of variations in temperature (collection, storage, or
transport)72.
The necessary means to address experimental variance are long-
itudinal sampling and specimen aliquoting. Longitudinal sampling (i.e.
collecting numerous serial samples from each test condition) from
pre-ﬂight, in-ﬂight, and post-ﬂight allows for greater statistical power
when assessing changes attributable to spaceﬂight. In addition, each
sample collected should be divided upon collection into multiple ali-
quots. This better assures that freeze-thaw cycles can be avoided in the
analysis stage, as freeze-thaw events can introduce considerable
experimental variance depending on the molecular class being mea-
sured. Maintaining all samples at their optimal storage temperature at
all times, typically -80 °C or lower (e.g. liquid nitrogen for cells), is
crucial73. Special attention must be given to how the collection and
storage methods in-ﬂight vary in relation to the conditions on Earth.
Spaceﬂight presents considerable differences in the operating envir-
onment, where ground conditions are far easier to control than ﬂight.
In practice, this may limit the types of samples that can be collected
during ﬂight.
Third, rigorous methods must be developed and followed to
pursue comparisons across missions with varying design para-
meters. In this consideration, there is an argument for the devel-
opment of specimen collection, transport, storage, processing,
analysis, and reporting standards. At the same time, this must be
balanced with the ﬂexibility required for innovation since standards
can sometimes limit advancement in methodology. In the present
study, common methods were used for the I4 and the Polaris Dawn
and Axiom-2 missions. However, selected methods may require
optimization for Polaris Dawn-like missions, to increase the yields
during sample processing and adapt to unique parameters imposed
by the anticipated spacewalk (extravehicular activity; EVA). More-
over, within standards or best practices, unique research for each
mission may require alteration of previously successful methods.
With these considerations in mind, we must balance methodology

standardization with advances in methodology options and mission-
speciﬁc objectives.
As the commercial spaceﬂight sector gains momentum and more
astronauts with different health proﬁles and backgrounds have access
to space, comprehensive data on the biological impact of short-
duration spaceﬂight is of paramount importance. Such data will fur-
ther expand our understanding and knowledge of how spaceﬂight
affects human physiology, microbial adaptations, and environmental
biology. The use of integrative omics technologies for civilian astro-
nauts has revealed novel responses across genomics, proteomics,
metabolomics,
microbiome,
and
transcriptomics
measures74–83.
Creating multi-omic datasets from spaceﬂight studies on astronaut
cohorts will further advance our understanding, inform future mission
planning, and help discover what appropriate countermeasures can be
developed to minimize future risk and enhance performance.
Validating sample collection methodologies initially in short-
duration commercial spaceﬂight is a key step for future human
health research in long-duration and exploration-class missions to
the Moon and beyond. To help meet these challenges, we have
established the SOMA protocols, which detail standard multi-omic
measures of astronaut health and protocols for sample collection
from astronaut cohorts. Although the all-civilian I4 crew pioneered
the ﬁrst use of the SOMA protocols, the methodology outlined here
is robust and generalizable, making it applicable to future astronaut
crews from any commercial mission provider (e.g., SpaceX, Axiom
Space, Sierra Space, Blue Origin) or space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA,
ROSCOSMOS). Furthermore, the SOMA banking, sequencing, and
processing methods are a springboard for continuing biospecimen
analysis and expanding our knowledge of multi-omic dynamics
before, during, and after human spaceﬂight missions, providing a
molecular roadmap for crew health, medical biometrics, and possi-
ble countermeasures.
Methods
Venous blood draw
Venipuncture was performed on each subject using a BD Vacutainer®
Safety-Lok™blood collection set (BD Biosciences, #367281) and a
Vacutainer one-use holder (BD Biosciences, 364815). The puncture
site was located near the cubital fossa and was sterilized with a BZK
antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Blood was col-
lected into 1 serum separator tube (SST, BD Biosciences: #367987,
Lot: #1158449, #1034773), 2 cell processing tubes (CPT, BD Bios-
ciences: #362753, Lot: #1133477, #1012161), 1 blood RNA tube (bRNA,
PAXgene: #762165, Lot: #1021333), 1 cell-free DNA BCT (cfDNA BCT,
Streck: #230470, Lot: #11530331), and 4 K2 EDTA blood collection
tubes (BD Biosciences, #367844, Lot: #0345756) per crew member
per time point. For samples collected in Hawthorne, blood was drawn
at SpaceX headquarters, then immediately transported to USC for
processing. Samples collected at Cape Canaveral were processed
on-site.

Blood tube processing
For processing, serum separator tubes (SST) were centrifuged at1300x
g for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of serum were aliquoted into 1 mL
Matrix 2D Screw Tubes (ThermoFisher, 3741-WP1D-BR) and stored at
-80 °C. SST tubes were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the
red blood cell pellet.
Cell processing tubes were centrifuged at 1800xg for 30 minutes.
Plasma was aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at
-80 °C. 5 mL of 2% FBS (ThermoFisher, #26140079) in PBS (Thermo-
Fisher, #10010023) was added to the CPT tube to resuspend PBMCs.
PBMC suspension was transferred to a clean 15 mL conical tube. The
total volume was brought to 15 mL with 2% FBS in PBS. The tube was
centrifuged for 15 minutes at 300x g. Supernatant was discarded.
PBMCs were resuspended 6 mL of 10% DMSO (Millipore Sigma,
#D4540-500mL) in FBS. 1 mL of PBMCs were moved to 6 cryogenic
vials (Corning, #8672). Cryovials were placed in a Mr. FrostyTM (Ther-
moFisher, #5100-0001) and stored at -80 °C. CPTs were recapped and
stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. There was one
outlier to this sample collection, the R + 194 timepoint, where CPT
sodium citrate tubes were used (BD Biosciences, Cat no. 362760).
cfDNA BCTs were centrifuged at 300xg for 20 minutes. Plasma
was transferred to a 15 mL conical tube. Plasma was centrifuged
5000xg for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of plasma were aliquoted into
1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. cfDNA BCTs were
recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet.
PAXgene blood RNA tubes were processed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, tubes were left upright for a
minimum of 2 hours before freezing at −20 °C. For RNA extraction,
tubes were thawed and processed with the PAXgene blood RNA kit
(Qiagen, #762164).
Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) Isolation
One 4 mL K2 EDTA tube was shipped on ice overnight to WCM for
processing. Blood was centrifuged at 500x g for 10 minutes, then
plasma was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 3000 x g for
20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C for
EVP isolation. Plasma volumes ranged between 0.6 - 1.7 ml. Plasma was
later thawed for downstream processing, when concentrations were
measured. Plasma samples were thawed on ice, and EVPs were isolated
by sequential ultracentrifugation (Hoshino et al., 2020). Samples were
centrifuged at 12,000x g for 20 minutes to remove microvesicles, then
EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter
Optima XE or XPE ultracentrifuge at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. EVPs
were then washed in PBS and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation at
100,000x g for 70 minutes. The ﬁnal EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS.
Dried blood spot (DBS)
Crew members warmed their hands and massaged their ﬁnger towards
the ﬁngertip to enrich blood ﬂow toward the puncture site. The
puncture site was sterilized using a BZK antiseptic towelette (Dynarex,
Reorder No. 1303). Skin was punctured using a contact-activated lan-
cet (BD Biosciences, #366593) or a 21-gauge needle (BD Biosciences,
#305167), depending on crew member preference. Capillary blood was
collected onto the Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS cards (Cytiva,
#10534612). Blood was transferred by touching only the blood droplet
to the surface of the DBS card. DBS cards were stored at room tem-
perature with a desiccant pack (Cytiva, #10548239).
Saliva
To collect crude saliva, crew members uncapped and spit into a sterile,
PCR-clean, 5 mL screw-cap tube (Eppendorf, 30122330). Crew spit
repeatedly until at least 1 mL was collected. Saliva was transported to a
sterile ﬂow hood and separated into 500uL aliquots. Aliquots were
frozen at -80 °C. To collect preserved saliva, crew members used the
OMNIgene ORAL kit (OME-505). Crew members spit into the kit’s tube
until they reached the ﬁll line. The tube was re-capped, which released
the preservative liquid. Tubes were inverted to mix the saliva and
preservative before being placed at −20 °C for storage. After all time-
points were collected, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted using the
AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein kit (Qiagen, #47054). Sample concentra-
tions were measured with Qubit high sensitivity dsDNA and RNA
platform. Proteins were quantiﬁed with the Pierce™Rapid Gold BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc, #A53225) on Promega GloMax
Plate Reader.
Urine
Crew members urinated into sterile specimen containers (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, #13-711-56). The container was stored at 4 C until it was
prepared for long-term storage. To prepare urine samples for long-
term storage, urine was aliquoted into 1 mL, 15 mL, and 50 mL tubes.
Half of the urine was immediately placed at −80 °C. The other half had
urine conditioning buffer (Zymo, #D3061-1-140) added to the sample
before placing in the -80 °C freezer.
Stool collection
Crew members isolated a stool sample using a paper toilet accessory
(DNA Genotek, OM-AC1). Stool was transferred into and OMNIgen-
e•GUT tube (DNAgenotek, OMR−200) and an OMNImet•GUT tube
(DNA Genotek, ME−200). Tubes were placed at -80 °C for long-term
storage. For nucleic acid extraction, 200uL of each tube was allocated
for DNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro kit and 200uL was
allocated to RNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerViral kit. The
remaining sample was split into 500uL aliquots and re-stored at -80 °C.
Swab collection
Crew members put on gloves and remove a sterile DNA/RNA swab
(Isohelix, SK-4S) from its packaging. For collection of the post-
auricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal
crease, glabella, toe web space, and capsule environment regions,
swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water (this step was skipped for
oral and nasal swabs) for ground collections. For in-ﬂight collections,
HFactor hydrogen infused water was used in place of nuclease-free
water. Each body location was swabbed for 30 seconds, using both
sides of the swab. Swabs were then placed in 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw
Tubes containing 400uL of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo). The tip of the
swab was broken off so that only the swab tip was stored in the Matrix
2D Screw Tube. Tubes were stored at 4 C.
Skin biopsies
Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm. Each
site was prepared by application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was
induced with administration of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epi-
nephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter
piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3
sections. The smaller piece was added to a formalin-ﬁlled specimen jar.
The larger piece was placed in a cryovial and stored at -80 °C. Surgical
defects were closed with 1 or 2 5-0 or 4-0 nylon sutures.
HEPA ﬁlter
HEPA Filter was taken apart and sectioned under a chemical hood to
avoid contamination. The ﬁlter contained two parts, an activated car-
bon component and a HEPA ﬁlter. The activated carbon component
was discarded and the ﬁlter was sectioned using a sterile blade. Sec-
tions were placed in individual specimen containers and stored
at −20 °C.
Human subjects research
All subjects were consented and samples were collected and processed
under the approval of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Pro-
tocol 21-05023569.
