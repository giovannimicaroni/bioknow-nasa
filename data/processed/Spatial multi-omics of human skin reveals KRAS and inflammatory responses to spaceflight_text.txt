Spaceﬂight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis
and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear.
To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceﬂight on the skin, we con-
ducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after
(R + 1) ﬂight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™Digital Spatial
Proﬁler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics,
we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune
changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner
epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-ﬂight samples showed sig-
niﬁcant up-regulation of genes related to inﬂammation and KRAS signaling
across all skin regions. These spaceﬂight-associated changes mapped to spe-
ciﬁc cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage,
epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration
were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial
disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC
single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our ﬁndings present the
inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for
future space missions and response countermeasures.
During both short- and long-duration spaceﬂight, the human body is
exposed to various factors that are unique to the space environment,
including weightlessness (e.g., microgravity), increased radiation, iso-
lation, and conﬁnement1,2. Due to the unique remote and spaceﬂight
environment, lifestyle and hygienic practices are different from an
Earth setting and often simpliﬁed due to the minimal resources and
space available in a spacecraft (e.g., lack of showers, restrooms, limited
clothing available)3. Moreover, signiﬁcant physiological adaptations
and overall shifts in biological homeostasis occur from spaceﬂight
exposure, including musculoskeletal deconditioning, cardiovascular
ﬂuid shifts, vision loss (e.g., spaceﬂight-associated neuro-ocular syn-
drome),
metabolic
shifts,
and
mitochondrial
and
immune
dysfunction4,5. Several studies have identiﬁed the effects of spaceﬂight
on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, including ﬂuid
redistribution, orthostatic intolerance, changes in heart rate, blood
pressure, cardiac output, arterial stiffening, bone loss, atrophy of the
striated and cardiac muscle groups, and increased risk of bone
fracture1,6–12.

The body’s largest organ, the skin, is another key physiological
system sensitive to environmental changes. Human skin serves multi-
ple functions, including physical and immunological protection, sup-
porting microbiota (containing bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses)
homeostasis, thermoregulation, ﬂuid retention, and metabolism13–15.
Also, since the skin is the outermost layer of the body and exposed to
the direct, external environment, it is usually the ﬁrst substrate affec-
ted by environmental changes an individual experiences, including
environmental adaptations resulting from spaceﬂight. The skin serves
as a unique organ for investigating the impacts of spaceﬂight on the
human body as it encompasses a range of physiological elements, from
surface microbiota and connective tissue to vasculatures, follicles, and
the nervous and immune systems, alongside various skin cell types. It
offers a comprehensive platform to understand the multifaceted
effects of spaceﬂight. Unfortunately, few studies exist on the space-
ﬂight environment’s impacton the skin, and observations to-date show
that spaceﬂight may cause epidermal hypersensitivity and irritation,
rarefaction of the cutaneous ﬁber network, and impaired epidermal
proliferation and repair16–20. Nonetheless, the skin remains an under-
studied organ in the ﬁeld of space biology; to date, fewer than ten
astronaut case evaluations have been conducted3. Furthermore, only a
few existing studies have examined transcript-level changes, and none
of these studies has contextualized spatial or whole transcriptome
gene expression or investigated the multiple omics components of
skin adapting from spaceﬂight exposure3,21,22.
Our study investigates skin samples collected from the SpaceX
Inspiration4 mission and, for the ﬁrst time, explores the spatial-
transcriptomic characterization of short-duration spaceﬂight’s impact
on skin tissue. We comprehensively proﬁled skin microenvironment
changes in response to spaceﬂight by performing a multi omics ana-
lysis using 4 mm skin punch biopsies from the crew members (n = 4)
44 days before launch (L-44) and 1 day after return (R + 1) of the 3-day
mission. Tissue location speciﬁc gene expression levels were quanti-
ﬁed using Nanostring GeoMx™Digital Spatial Proﬁler (DSP) system
across four regions of interest (ROI) targets, Outer Epidermis (OE) and
Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA) com-
partments. From immunoﬂuorescence images, we identiﬁed epi-
dermis, dermis, and vascular area and subdivided epidermis ROIs into
outer and inner layers, which corresponded to granular and spinous
layer (OE) and basal layer (IE). In total, we analyzed 95 astronaut skin
ROIs using the human whole-transcriptome atlas (WTA, 18,676 genes).
We also correlate these transcript level ﬁndings with matched meta-
genomic and metatranscriptomic data from skin swabs obtained prior
to biopsy, as well as single-cell sequencing data (10X multiome single-
cell ATAC and gene expression (GEX) characterizations) from isolated
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
Results
Transcriptome-wide changes in response to spaceﬂight
To understand the impact of spaceﬂight to skin and tissue micro-
environment, paired 4 mm skin punch biopsies from Inspiration4 crew
members’ upper arms were used for pathology evaluation and spatial
transcriptomics proﬁling (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, 95
ROIs were collected across 16 slides for processing, with the GeoMx
whole transcriptome proﬁling probe set (18,422 probes). Based on
imaging we selected four region types of interest, including the outer
epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and the vasculature (OE, IE,
OD, and VA). We also performed a skin histopathology analysis from
the biopsied samples, which showed no signiﬁcant abnormalities or
changes in tissue morphologies or gross architecture (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2).
From GeoMx spatial transcriptomics analysis, unsupervised clus-
tering of all ROIs showed large clustering around compartmental
identities. Slight shifts in response to spaceﬂight, and batch effects
from both technical and biological replicates were not apparent after
normalization (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Differential gene
expression analysis comparing post-spaceﬂight to pre-spaceﬂight
samples found signiﬁcant upregulation in 95 genes (log2FC > 0 and q
value < 0.05 by DESeq2) including ARHGAP31, GALNT9, CPNE2, NMB,
GPR50, CLDN2, OOSP2, and downregulation in 121 genes (log2FC < 0
and q value < 0.05 by DESeq2) such as AP3B1, LMNA, COL6A2, VIM, HLA-
B, PPP1CB, PABPC1 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore,
proteins associated with cell junctions and extracellular matrices—
particularly those from vimentin (VIM) and keratin (KRT) family—were
the primary transcripts lost based on the DEG analyses.
Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
revealed statistically signiﬁcant enrichment in kirsten rat sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog (KRAS) signaling pathways, while transcripts
associated with cell junctions and protein (i.e., apical junction, unfol-
ded protein response) decreased (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Data 2).
From expression levels, cell type composition for each ROI was esti-
mated and compared across timepoints. We also observed statistically
signiﬁcant decreases in the cell type associated gene signatures of the
major skin cell types and immune cells (e.g., melanocyte, pericyte,
ﬁbroblast, and T cells) (Fig. 1e).
Region-speciﬁc expressions and spaceﬂight-induced changes
We then investigated region-speciﬁc expression changes across pre-
and post-spaceﬂight samples for each ROI type label (OE, IE, OD, and
VA). OE and IE regions were selected based on and corresponds to
stratum granulosum and spinosum/basal, respectively. OD ROIs were
selected by capturing a minimum of 200 cells inside of the basal cell
layer (therefore mostly papillary layer), while VA ROIs were collected
based on epithelial (FAP) and ﬁbroblast (αSMA) staining (Fig. 1a). We
observed transcripts speciﬁc to each ROI label and timepoint (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3b, c).
For each ROI type, differential gene expression analyses were
performed comparing postﬂight samples relative to preﬂight samples
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 1). For example, we found that the
decrease in transcripts related to ﬁbroblast and junction genes (e.g.,
DES, ACTA2, TLN1, TAGLN) speciﬁcally near the vasculature sites (VA).
Loss of KRT14 as well as other keratin family transcripts (KRT1, 5, and
10) were found predominantly in the dermal layer (OD). Taking the
intersections of these DEGs to identify unique and overlapping genes
across ROI types, we conﬁrmed that most of the gene overlaps occur
within ROI types that are relatively close to each other (i.e., VA and OD)
(Fig. 2b). In particular, changes in AP3B1, a transcript related to granule
formation, cytokine production, and inﬂammatory responses, were
found in multiple comparisons (overall, OE, and OD) and was ortho-
gonally validated with another technology, RNA scope (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4a–c)23. In the inner layers of the tissue (OD and VA), we found
overlapping DEGs related to stress and growth factor associated
pathways, such as COL6A2, CRKL, HLA-B.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed the consistent
increase of KRAS signaling and inﬂammatory responses across all
regions while speciﬁc immune pathways such as Interferon alpha and
gamma response showed positive enrichment only in epidermal
regions (OE and IE) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 2). Pathways such
as DNA repair, apoptosis, and UV response, reactive oxygen species
were enriched only in the OE. We observed downregulation in genes
involved with mitochondrial metabolism (e.g., myc target genes and
oxidative phosphorylation) across all regions, particularly stronger in
IE and OD ROIs. Also, the myogenesis pathway and EMT-related genes
showed stronger decrease in enrichment scores in the VA ROIs,
underscoring the region- and layer-speciﬁc responses to spaceﬂight.
Comparing the pathway-level changes to blood sequencing datasets
from the same mission and previous mission (NASA Twin Study,
although with different duration of exposure), we found consistent
changes
in
pathways
such
as
KRAS
signaling,
epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 4d)5.

In addition to differential analyses, we also found that the mar-
ker genes reported to be speciﬁc to each skin layer and cell type
corresponded to the expression levels in each ROI type and were
consistent with the previous ﬁndings (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c)24–26.
Based on the reference datasets, deconvolved cell type abundances
were compared across ROI types and timepoints (Supplementary
Fig. 5a). We found a loss of melanocyte related gene signatures
speciﬁcally in the middle layers (IE and OD), not in the outermost
region (OE) or vascular region deeper in the dermal layer (VA). On the
contrary, ﬁbroblast related gene expressions were decreased across
all regions except for the outermost epidermal layer (OE). Although
ﬁbroblast is an unanticipated cell type in the epidermis ROIs,
decreased ﬁbroblast signature could indicate loss or damage of cel-
lular and matrix interactions, consistent with previous reports high-
lighting

ﬁbroblasts

regeneration
(Supplementary Fig. 5b, c)27,28.
Epithelial barrier disruption and regeneration observed in post-
spaceﬂight samples
To investigate the phenotypic impact of spaceﬂight, we then focused
on genes and pathways related to skin barrier formation, disruption,
and regeneration. From the pathway analysis, we found enrichment
changes in apical junction, UV stress response, hypoxia, and TGFβ
signaling (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 2). Speciﬁcally, we observed
a decrease in ﬁlaggrin (FLG) expression, a gene related to skin barrier
function and plays a crucial role during epidermal differentiation by
controlling interactions across cytoskeleton components, in postﬂight
relative to preﬂight samples29. The decrease of FLG was the most evi-
dent in the OE region (Supplementary Data 1). Related to this obser-
vation, we also observed decreases in transcripts such as HAS1, HAS2,
HAS3, OCLN, CLDN, TGM2 in the OE region (Fig. 3a).
The decrease in protein production and response potentially are
connected to decrease in keratinocyte and increase in immune

signatures (potentially related to interactions with T cells and ﬁbro-
blasts) in OE region ROIs (Fig. 3b)30. Although weaker, the IE region
shows a similar trend of cell proportion fold changes. Speciﬁcally,
among ﬁbroblast populations we also found that gene signatures of
reticular ﬁbroblast increased in postﬂight samples while there were no
statistically signiﬁcant changes in papillary ﬁbroblast, suggesting dis-
ruptions in regeneration processes (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c)31,32.
Taking co-occurrence of the proportion changes, cellular interactions
within the ROIs were estimated. While cluster disruption was relatively
minimal, an increase in melanocyte-macrophage interactions were
found in the epidermis (OE and IE) ROIs (Fig. 3c). In addition, expres-
sion changes related to vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells and
pericytes varied across the skin regions. The most pronounced cell
signaturechanges were seen in the OE and VA compartments. In the OE
compartment, we observed an increase in signatures related to lym-
phatic endothelial cells, potentially indicating the changes in the skin’s
vascular and immune system (Fig. 3b). While blood and lymphatic
capillaries are not typically found in the epidermis, these adaptations
may be suggestive of a wound-healing phenotype with the skin, which
is supported by our results showing increased damage, inﬂammation,
apoptosis, ROS, hypoxia, angiogenesis, TGF-beta expression, etc., in
the epidermis (Fig. 2c)33,34. On the other hand, in the VA compartment,
there was an increase of gene signatures related to blood endothelium
and decrease in lymphatic endothelium, also associated with vascular
remodeling events.
Skin-microbiota interaction changes during spaceﬂight
To test whether immune activation and epithelial barrier disruption
can be explained with external environmental change, we performed
metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis on the skin swabs
collected right before biopsies (Supplementary Fig. 6a). After assign-
ment of taxonomic labels to DNA sequences, we identiﬁed 826 bac-
terial and 9819 viral species with non-zero counts from metagenomics
analysis, and 88 bacterial and 1456 viral species from metatran-
scriptomics analysis (Supplementary Data 3). From PCA analysis, no
major clustering was observed, although post ﬂight samples were
located closer to one another in the PCA space (Fig. 4a). The shifts of
the samples were mostly from species from Staphylococcus and
Streptococcus family, along the PC2 axis. Slight decrease in overall
numbers of bacterial and viral species was observed in postﬂight
samples relative to preﬂight, with one exception of C003 in metage-
nomics data and of C004 in metatranscriptomics data (Fig. 4b). Gross
comparison of bacterial species by family showed decreased abun-
dance in Actinobacteria (e.g., Actinomyces sp000220835) while

and Proteobacteria/Pseudomonadota (e.g., Caulobacter vibrioides,

(Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 6b). When grouped into genus,
several species, including Cutibacterium (e.g., Cutibacterium acnes/
avidum/modestum/porci), Mycobacterium (e.g., Mycobacterium para-

domonas aeruginosa/nitroreducens) showed statistically signiﬁcant
decrease (p values < 0.05). Several species including Streptococcus
(e.g., Staphylococcus capitis, Streptococcus mitis BB) and Veillonella
(e.g., Veillonella atypica/parvula/rogosae) showed signiﬁcant increase
(Fig. 4d). Also, species under the Staphylococcus genus, such as sta-
phylococcus capitis/epidermidis/saprophyticus showed slight decrease
while the relative abundances were highly variable across biological
replicates.
Changes of bacterial species were then linked to skin gene
expression proﬁles, especially dermatitis-related genes (i.e., STAT3,
STAT5B, FLG, CDSN, and ADAM17) previously associated with Staphy-
lococcus species, as Staphylococcus aureus-dependent atopic derma-

microbe diversity35–37 (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 6c). When sub-
setting previously reported bacterial species and associated genes, we
found Staphylococcus species show an inverse relationship with JAK1
(Fig. 4e). In particular, Staphylococcus correlates closely to FLG,
SPINK5, and DSG1, all of which are related with epithelial barriers
(stratum corneum and junctional barriers)38. Also, microbes belong to
Carnobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Nanosynbacteraceae, and Week-
sellaceae families showed high correlation with both barrier and
immune genes (CDSN, DSP, DSG1, SPINK5, FLG, and JAK1), whereas
common skin microbes from Dermatophilaceae and Dermabacter-
aceae families showed no correlation. Although larger sample size is
needed, it is possible that skin microbiome disruptions, such as those
observed in these bacterial families, also contribute to barrier dis-
ruption and immune activation during short-term spaceﬂight.
In addition, from alignment to known viral assemblies we found
statistically signiﬁcant decrease in abundance of reads associated with
those
from
Uroviricota
(i.e.,
Fromanvirus,
Acadianvirus,
Arm-
strongvirus, Amginevirus, Bixzunavirus) and Naldaviricetes (i.e., Alpha-
baculovirus), and increased abundance of reads associated with those
from Negarnaviricota (i.e., Almendravirus, Orthotospovirus) and Cos-
saviricota (i.e., Betapapillomavirus, Betapolyomavirus) (p values <
0.05). Virome changes are limited by the depth of the sequencing and
skin virome knowledge, however we also report relative abundances of
both bacterial and viral species (Supplementary Data 3). To explore
microbiota-skin interactions, we also identiﬁed potential associations
between microbiome shifts from metagenomics/metatranscriptomics
data and human gene expression from skin spatial transcriptomics
data; these included associations were with viral phyla (i.e., Uroviricota,
Cressdnaviricota, Phixviricota), which is a potentially interesting area
to explore as more crew samples are collected. (Supplementary
Fig. 6d, e and Supplementary Data 3).
Immune changes in response to spaceﬂight
To investigate immune changes that occur beneath the epidermis we
also examined changes in immune cells in the proﬁled vascular regions
vs. PBMCs. We saw overall decrease of T cells and increase of macro-
phage DCs in VA ROIs (Fig. 3b), indicating an immune-epidermis
interaction. Related to this, we also observed increased cytokines and
inﬂammatory signals including IL4, IL5, and IFNG in the inner regions
(VA and OD ROIs) of the tissue (Fig. 5a)39,40. As a conﬁrmation, we
observed that these speciﬁc cytokines are also shown to be increased
in cytokine assays from the crew members’ serum samples (Fig. 5b). To
compare immune change observations from VA ROIs to system-wide
immune system changes, we performed leveraged 10X multiome
sequencing (dual snRNA and ATAC sequencing from each cell) on
timepoint-matched PBMCs from the crew members (Supplementary
Fig. 7a). We analyzed 151,411 cells across 9 gross cell types and per-
formed differential expression analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c).
Overall, we observed ﬂuctuations of T-cells across timepoints, con-
sistent to the observations from skin spatial transcriptomics data
(Fig. 5c, d and Supplementary Fig. 7d). Among 555 DEGs from multi-
ome samples and 446 DEGs from GeoMx VA ROIs, 12 overlapping DEGs
were found (both log2FC > 0.1 and p values < 0.01, DESeq2), including
ATP11A, CEP85L, CEPT1, DMXL1, DOP1A, EVI5, GSAP, MDFIC, SENP7,
TBCK, VAV3, and VPS13C (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Several of
these genes are related to cellular metabolism and cytosolic trans-
ports. In particular, VAV3, one of signaling adapters in NK/T cell acti-
vation, has been previously reported to be associated with atopic
dermatitis onset41–43. While all these overlapping DEGs were temporary
in PBMCs, i.e., upregulated in the immediate postﬂight samples (R + 1
timepoint) and returned to pre-ﬂight expression levels, the chromatin
accessibility of these genes stayed slightly longer, up to R + 45 time-
point (Fig. 5d).
Finally, we derived cell type- and spaceﬂight-speciﬁc gene sig-
natures from the multiome data, to examine any enrichment in the
GeoMx samples (using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, or
ssGSEA approach) (Fig. 5e). Most of the immune cell speciﬁc postﬂight
DEGs enrichments were near the innermost ROIs (OD and VA), except
for T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+), which showed enrichment in the
postﬂight OE ROIs. While it was previously reported that spaceﬂight
stressors change the immune system, increased enrichment of the
T cells in the epidermal region correlates with activated T cell activity
and connects to inﬂammatory responses and barrier disruptions44–48.
Lastly, we found that these increased T cell signatures in the OE region
may not have direct connection to Th17 T cells or psoriasis, rather have
closer connection to the antigen-associated and lymphatic T cells
inﬁltrated from inner layers of the skin (Fig. 5f)49,50. Also, the ssGSEA
analysis using skin disease-associated gene signatures showed a slight
increase in melanoma signatures. The slight increase can be explained
with previous observations throughout this manuscript, including
increase in cell death, immune activation, and stress response (Sup-
plementary Fig. 7e, f), but more research is needed to prove the direct
connection or causality of gene expression shifts.
Discussion
In this study, we applied a battery of omics methods of the Inspiration4
crew to discern the impact of spaceﬂight on the skin, collecting and
integrating skin spatial transcriptomics data with clinical, metage-
nomic, metatranscriptomic, and single-cell sequencing data. By per-
forming spatially resolved sequencing of astronaut skin biopsies
before and after short-term spaceﬂight, we see varying transcriptomic
and cellular changes and responses speciﬁc with their four skin layers
(outer and inner epidermis, dermis, and vasculature) across 95 ROIs
from all four crew members. To provide a more comprehensive view of
these changes in response to the spaceﬂight environment and stres-
sors, we correlated the spatial expression proﬁles with the metage-
nomics and metatranscriptomics data with the skin swab and PBMC
single-cell sequencing data collected from the same crew member and
from the same biopsy locations.
The Inspiration4 mission was a short-term (3-day ﬂight) space-
ﬂight, with minimal exposure to radiation (about 2.7 mGy-Eq based on
NASA Q quality factors and 50% FAX ModelEffective dose). Most of
these changes are expected to be temporary, based on prior missions’
data, and due to ﬂuid redistribution and stress from the spaceﬂight
itself. At the molecular level, we observed consistent changes in
immune signals and extracellular matrix and junction proteins in the
postﬂight samples relative to preﬂight. Most evidently, we see a strong
increase in gene expression of the KRAS pathway, which has previously
been discussed in the context of space radiation51. In the context of
skin, KRAS is known to alter epidermis homeostasis and induces
redundant skin, papillomas, defective skin cell proliferation and dif-
ferentiation and associated with many skin diseases such as melor-
heostosis, lymphangiomatosis, and vascular stenosis52–54. Activated
KRAS, as a part of RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, is responsible for
many angiogenic pathways, cytokine/chemokine productions, bio-
chemical pathways (e.g., PI3K, RAF, etc.), and cellular proliferation/
renewals55. When activated, the KRAS oncogene has the greatest
mutation rate of all cancers, and is linked to several difﬁcult to treat,
highly lethal cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, non-
small-cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer56.
In the context of keratinocyte biology, KRAS plays various roles
including proliferation, survival, cell-cell adhesion, and polarity and
redox balance, and the Ras pathway is also activated by integrins and
negatively regulated by cell-cell adhesion57. KRAS has many roles
across three key cell types, including: (1) endothelial cells (i.e.,
mechanotransduction pathways and integrin-associated events58), (2)
ﬁbroblast reprogramming (i.e., inﬂammatory gene expression and
tissue extracellular signaling effectors, which polarizes immune
populations while preventing tissue repair59), and (3) pericytes (i.e.,
wound healing and scarformation, and endothelial tubulogenesis, plus

apical membrane and cytoskeletal polarization, which mediates the
interaction between endothelial cells and pericytes60,61). From our
results, we also see changes in various cell populations, including
melanocyte, pericyte, ﬁbroblast, and lymphatic endothelial cells, with
KRAS being a likely mechanistic pathway being altered from space-
ﬂight exposure within these cell populations leading to their pheno-
type changes. The impairment of skin cell proliferation is consistent
with relative decrease in melanocytes and ﬁbroblasts in postﬂight
samples.
Related to this observation, other non-inﬂammatory pathways
such as WNT-βcatenin, TGFβ, Notch, ROS, glycolysis, apoptosis, oxi-
dative phosphorylation, G2M checkpoints, also show signiﬁcant
changes. These pathways may provide more context as to why KRAS is
changing, as well as the phenotypic adaptations and distribution
changes seen with the cell populations. For example, from a metabolic
perspective, an increase in glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative
phosphorylation is tied with apoptotic events, decreased oxygen
supply/hypoxia (e.g., change in cardiovascular function, increased
inﬂammation, increased wound healing, etc.), as a compensatory
response to the environmental insult. TGFβ is involved with ECM
remodeling, inﬂammatory pathways, and these various cell types
affect these biological events. Notch and WNT-βcatenin are involved
with cytoskeletal/cell-cell adhesion processes. Furthermore, looking at
the host of inﬂammatory pathways changing (interferon, TNFα, com-
plement, interleukin), primarily pro-inﬂammatory given the timeframe
of this mission as well as environmental insults (e.g., radiation expo-
sure, weightlessness) that also exacerbate the biochemical pathways
that are being shifted after spaceﬂight (e.g., metabolic, cell pheno-
typic, increased apoptosis, etc.).
The spatial analysis enabled a unique study of gene expression
changes, at higher resolution across the layers of skin, plus also within
distinct tissue compartments. While all regions show varying but
consistent enrichment in inﬂammation-related pathways, we are able
to locate damage and repair related pathways (i.e., DNA repair, apop-
tosis, and UV response, reactive oxygen species) in epidermal (mostly
outer layers) regions, suggesting that the skin’s stressors from space-
ﬂight occur primarily in the outermost region. Space radiation can
cause damage to DNA directly through interaction of charged particles
with DNA itself or indirectly through the production of free radicals
(which we also see from the increased oxidative stress transcripts)62.
The type of DNA damage can also differ, from single-strand to double-
strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, copy number variation, and
other genomic changes. The level of DNA repair depends on the cell
type and its capacity for repair as well, with more rapidly replicating
cell types (e.g., epithelial cells vs. endothelial cells) having more active
DNA repair mechanisms63. Of note, spaceﬂight can also cause
increased reactive oxygen species production, likely also from radia-
tion exposure64–68. We also identify speciﬁc keratin (KRT) transcripts in
dermal layer and loss of ﬁbroblast and cell junction transcripts
including DES, ACTA2, TLN1, and TAGLN in vascular regions, which may
be related to epithelial barrier disruptions and hindered regeneration.
Various spaceﬂight and ground-analog studies have shown spaceﬂight
induces oxidative damage to cell junctional proteins and adhesion.
Further supporting epithelial barrier disruptions, we show
decrease in barrier-related transcripts (i.e., FLG, HAS, OCLN, CLDN) and
relate the loss of these proteins to microbiome changes using meta-
genomics and metatranscriptomics data from the swabs. Some of
these changes may be related to the changes in skin microbiota.
Consistent to previous reports from the International Space Station
(ISS), we ﬁnd changes in microbes such as Corynebacterium, Actino-
myces, and Staphylococcus in the Inspiration4 crew skin samples,
despite the small sample size69. We then correlated microbiome
changes with gene expression ﬂuctuations and identiﬁed gene-
microbe clusters. While many of these changes are known to be
associated with the microbial composition within the capsule,
systematic studies spanning spaceﬂight environment, skin surface,
and gene expression will provide additional insights to which coun-
termeasures are needed70,71.
Connecting the ﬁndings in the immune system, we cross-validated
these results with 10X multiome proﬁling of PBMCs and reported
consistent immunological changes. We identify overall loss of immune
cells in vascular ROIs, while T-cell signature increases in the outermost
epidermal layers. T-cell migration and inﬁltration in epidermal layers
have been previously associated with skin inﬂammation and several
disease conditions72, and several other studies have connected
immune system dysregulation and adaptations to spaceﬂight expo-
sure. For example, consistent adaptive immune system changes (for
example, T cells generally shift toward a Th2 phenotype) are consistent
with our observation that T cells shifts can lead to ﬂuctuations in
cytokine concentration44,73. We also found increases in macrophages
and various chemotactic markers (e.g., CCL2, CCL4, CXCL5), which are
previously associated with spaceﬂight. These changes, which were
predicted in peripheral, circulating blood cells, are shown within the
vasculatures of the skin tissue microenvironment. Furthermore, by
taking intersections of DEGs from both skin spatial proﬁling and PBMC
single-cell, we saw an enrichment of genes related to neutrophils. Such
observation is consistent with previous observations from space
shuttle ﬂights studies74. It has been shown that neutrophils increase in
postﬂight
samples,
likely
due
to
inﬂight
stress
rather
than
microgravity.
Related to this observation, the changes in the microvascular
network seen (both blood and lymphatic), may also be suggestive of
local tissue adaptations resulting from ﬂuid redistribution and inter-
stitial
pressure
changes.
It
has
been
previously
shown
that
microgravity-induced capillary transmural pressure (blood to tissue)
change may reduce lymphatic ﬂow and is discussed in the context of
ocular health8,75. These changes in lymphatic ﬂow and cellular micro-
environment are also crucial for immune and stem cell interactions
and turnovers, therefore deeper investigations to characterize the
changes and develop countermeasures are crucial76,77.
Overall, we present a thorough model of skin tissue (1) inter-
acting with microbes and viruses on the surface, (2) changing
expression proﬁles layer-by-layer, and (3) signaling from circulating
PBMCs that likely interact with the peripheral skin vasculature. Our
study is limited by four crew members, two timepoints, and a short-
term mission, but to mediate this limitation, the data has been
compared with other research and analog models (Henry Cope and
Jonas Elsborg et al., Nature Communications, in review). In addition,
some limitations are due to the unique challenges associated with
the
astronaut
samples,
including:
their
difﬁcult
procurement
(biopsy), their rarity (there are few missions being conducted), and
limited
infrastructure
for
on-site
sample
collection
and
processing78–83. Nonetheless, these ﬁrst structural and molecular
views into the epidermal response to spaceﬂight highlight key KRAS,
immune, and related pathways that can be integrated in the future
missions and on-site monitoring of crews84 to help researchers
understand the long-term effects of the spaceﬂight stressors and
cellular changes we identiﬁed in this study.

Sample collection
Skin biopsy and swabs. The biopsies were collected from all four crew
members’ right (preﬂight) and left (postﬂight) deltoid (or upper arm)
that were anatomically the same, matched locations, except for one
crew member. For this crew member, both timepoints were collected
from the right arm, approximately 1.5 inches away from one another.
The average age of the crew members was 41.5 and consisted of two
males and two females. Prior to biopsy, the selected areas were
swabbed for 30 s with pressure using an Isohelix Swab dampened with
DNase and RNase free water. The swabs were stored in the pre-labeled
Thermo Fisher 2D barcoded tubes with DNA/RNA Shield Stabilization
Solution (Zymo Research, cat# R1100-250) added. After the swab, the
area was disinfected using CloraPrep (BD Biosciences) followed by
injection of 1% lidocaine and 1/100,000 epinephrine. The biopsies were
performed using a trephine punch (Miltex). If desired, the surgical sites
were either closed with two 5-0 Vicryl sutures or applied pressure to
stop bleeding. To prevent infection and allow healing, bacitracin
ointment or sterile petrolatum was applied to the biopsied site fol-
lowed by Band-Aids and after-care instructions. The resected piece was
cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3 sections. The smaller piece was
ﬁxed with formalin and stored at room temperature for histology and
pathology. The larger piece was ﬂash frozen for GeoMx analysis.
PBMC isolations. For each crew member, 8 ml of venous blood was
collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant
tubes. Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from
whole blood using the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail or
by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a
granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µl/ml of blood) for 20 min at room
temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate
PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2%
FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to
remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion
cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient cen-
trifugation. Granulocytes were identiﬁed using side scatter and the
lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm noz-
zle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into
two fractions to generate single-cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or
Multiome (GEX and ATAC) libraries.
Spatial transcriptomics analysis
GeoMx digital spatial proﬁling. Skin biopsy samples from four crew
members were collected and frozen in cryovials pre and post ﬂight.
Collected skin was ﬂash embedded in OCT blocks. Three or four
replicate of OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide per
subject including pre and post ﬂight replicates. Tissues were then
cryosectioned at 5 µm thickness and attached to glass microscope
slides (Fisher Scientiﬁc, cat# 22-037-246).
Immunoﬂuorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin

and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R&D Systems cat# IC1420R, Alexa
Fluor® 647, clone 1A4, 1:200 dilution) were used for region or interest
(ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to
assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides
were thawed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 °C
followed by PBS washes for thorough ﬁxation. After washes, slides
were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Pre-
paration Protocol for ﬁxed frozen samples, digesting samples with
1.0 µg/ml proteinase K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at
100 °C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the
GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM
ﬁnal concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology
markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13
(DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per
slide. Slides incubated with 225 μl of morphology marker solution at
RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP
instrument. The 20x scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide
selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal
(OD) and vascular (VA) regions. OE ROIs covered spinous and granular
layers, while IE ROIs covered the basal layer, identiﬁed from the
staining of the tissue. To ensure proper selection and to avoid overlaps
across different ROI types, small gaps between each ROI type were
made, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were com-
piled into FASTQ ﬁles corresponding to each ROI. FASTQ ﬁles were
then converted to digital count conversion ﬁles using the NanoString
GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the normalized count matrix, DESeq2
was used to perform differential expression analysis (Supplementary
Data 1), and FGSEA was used for pathway enrichment analysis, which
uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like enrichment score test to obtain statis-
tics (Supplementary Data 2). GSVA was used to run ssGSEA analysis
with custom gene signatures obtained from published single-cell and
bulk skin datasets25,26. The methods used to perform data exploration
and visualization have been published previously78.
PBMC single-cell sequencing analysis
Library preparation and sequencing. To capture T cell and B cell
variability, diversity, and joining (VDJ) repertoire, single-cell gel beads-
in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x
Genomics). Prior to single-cell Multiome ATAC and gene expression
sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in
100 µl of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM
NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin,
1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for
4 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 ml cold wash buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA,
0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation
(1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in diluted nuclei
buffer (10x Genomics Single-Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a con-
centration of 6000 nuclei per µl. Single-cell libraries were generated
via the Chromium Next GEM Single-Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene
Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
The
libraries
were
sequenced
on
the
NovaSeq
6000 sequencing system. GEX and ATAC libraries were processed
using Cell Ranger arc v2.0.0. VDJ libraries were processed using Cell
Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome.
Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis
DNA/RNA library preparation and sequencing. Samples were col-
lected prior to processing as isohelix swabs stored in 400 ul of Zymo
Research DNA/RNA shield (cat# R1100) in Thermo Fisher Matrix 1.0 ml
ScrewTop Tubes (cat# 3741-WP1D-BR). Prior to beginning the extrac-
tion protocol, samples were vortexed for 5 s using the MO BIO Vortex
Adapter tube holder (cat# 13000-V1-24) to ensure maximum biomo-
lecular yield from the collected swabs. Due to loss in DNA/RNA shield
during sample collection, sample volume was transferred into AllPrep
Bacterial Bead Tubes provided by the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/
RNA/Protein Kit (cat# 47054) and the volume of samples were adjus-
ted to 350 ul prior to further processing to ensure sufﬁcient input
volume for the extraction protocol. DNA/RNA/Protein extraction was
performed using the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit
(cat# 47054). Steps one and two were omitted from the Qiagen Allprep
Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit manufacturer’s protocol as these
samples were not generated through bacterial culture. Aside from this
omission, samples were extracted following the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. Following the completion of the extraction protocol, the

extracted DNA was quantiﬁed using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS
Assay (cat# Q33231), extracted RNA was quantiﬁed using Thermo
Fisher Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q32855), and extracted protein
was measured using the Thermo Fisher Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay
(cat # A53225). All quantiﬁcation protocols were conducted per man-
ufacturer’s instructions.
Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted
DNA and cDNA (from RNA) samples for Illumina Whole genome
sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT®
for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96
Samples). In total, 408 DNA samples (4 × 96-well plates and 24 samples
on a 5th 96-well plate) were library prepared and pooled into a total of
4 pools—96 samples were pooled into 1 (for plates 1, 2 and 3), except
for plates 4 and 5, where 120 libraries were pooled into 1. Each library
pool was sequenced using 2 × 150 Paired end sequencing on S4 ﬂow
cell using NovaSeq 6000 sequencer, one pool per lane of the S4
ﬂow cell.
Genomic data preprocessing and quality control. All metagenomic
and metatranscriptomic samples underwent the same quality control
pipeline prior to downstream analysis. Software used was run with the
default settings unless otherwise speciﬁed. The majority of our quality
control pipeline makes use of bbtools (V38.92), starting with clumpify
[parameters: optical = f, dupesubs = 2, dedupe = t] to group reads,
bbduk [parameters: qout = 33 trd = t hdist = 1 k = 27 ktrim = “r” mink = 8
overwrite = true trimq = 10 qtrim = “rl” threads = 10 minlength = 51
maxns = −1 minbasefrequency = 0.05 ecco = f] to remove adapter
contamination, and tadpole [parameters: mode = correct, ecc = t,
ecco = t] to remove sequencing error79. Unmatching reads were
removed using bbtool’s repair function. Alignment to the human
genome with Bowtie2 (parameters: --very-sensitive-local) was done to
remove potentially human-contaminating reads80.
Taxonomic abundance quantiﬁcation. We used the XTree (https://
github.com/GabeAl/UTree) [parameters: –redistribute] to quantify the
bacterial and viral taxonomic compositions of the metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic samples. XTree is the recent version of Utree81; it
implements an optimized alignment approach and increased ease of
use. In brief, XTree is a k-mer based aligner (akin to Kraken282, but
faster and designed for larger databases) that uses capitalist read
redistribution in order to pick the highest-likelihood mapping between
a read and a given reference based on the overall support of all reads in
a sample for said reference83. Notably, it reports the total coverage of a
given query genome, as well as total unique coverage, which refers to
coverage of regions found in only one genome of an entire genome
database.
We generated an XTree k-mer database [parameters: XTree BUILD
k 29 comp 0] from the Genome Taxonomy Database representative
species dataset (Release 207) and aligned both metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic samples. For the metagenomic sequencing, we
ﬁltered for genomes that had at least 0.5% coverage (i.e., approxi-
mately 15 genes in 3000 genes, each 1000 bp) and/or 0.25% unique
coverage. Relative abundances were calculated by dividing the total
reads assigned to a given genome by the total number of reads
assigned to all genomes in each sample.
Cytokine assay
Biochemical assays from the serum samples obtained from the same i4
crew members was performed using the bead-based multiplexed assay
protocols
provided
by
Eve
Technologies
(https://www.
evetechnologies.com/cytokine/). Two biomarker proﬁling panels
were used: (1) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay®
Array (HD71) and (2) Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex
Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9). Concentration values from the
assay were extrapolated using a 4 of 5 parameter logic standard curve.
Chromogenic in situ hybridization
Using additional sections from the same FFPE blocks, AP3B1 tran-
scripts were quantiﬁed using custom RNA probe. Five-micron thick
sections were cut from the parafﬁn blocks and mounted on glass
slides. For each block two duplicate serial sections were mounted on a
single slide, stained, and analyzed. Chromogenic in situ hybridization
was performed on an automated stainer (Leica Bond RX, Leica Bio-
systems, Deer Park, IL) with RNAscope 2.5 LS Assay Reagent Kit-Red
(Cat. # 322150, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) and Bond
Polymer Reﬁne Red Detection (Cat. # DS9390, Leica Biosystems) fol-
lowing manufacturer’s standard protocol. A probe was designed to
detect region 301-1333 of human AP3B1 gene, NCBI Reference
Sequence 126221 (Cat. # 1262218-C1; Advanced Cell Diagnostics).
Positive control probe detecting a housekeeping gene (human PPIB,
cat # 313908, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and a negative control probe
detecting bacterial (Bacillus subtilis) dapB gene (cat #312038,
Advanced Cell Diagnostics) were used to conﬁrm adequate RNA pre-
servation and detection, and absence of non-speciﬁc signal, respec-
tively. The chromogen was fast red and the counterstain hematoxylin.
Positive RNA hybridization was identiﬁed as discrete, punctate chro-
mogenic red dots under brightﬁeld microscopy. Images were acquired
with an Olympus VS200 slides scanner and VS200 ASW 3.4.1 software
(Evident Scientiﬁc, Hamburg, Germany) using a 40X/0.95NA objective
and extended focal imaging mode to generate whole slide images with
a pixel size of 0.1369 µm. Images were analyzed using Halo
3.5.3577 software and ISH module 4.2.3 (Indica Labs, Albuquerque,
NM). The entire epidermis region was annotated manually and ana-
lyzed. As melanin pigment was observed in the epidermis it was set as
an exclusion stain in order to avoid its false detection as red stain.
Probe size was set at 1.0000 µm2. Average probe copy number per cell
was reported. Image acquisition and analysis were performed by a
board-certiﬁed veterinary pathologist.
