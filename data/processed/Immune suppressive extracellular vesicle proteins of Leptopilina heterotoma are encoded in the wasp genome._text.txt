ABSTRACT Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their Dro-
sophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The
venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred
to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have
remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses
of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identiﬁed 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, in-
fection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional
proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports
vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the
whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome
revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results
explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical in-
heritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for
co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over
their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of ﬁgitid and related wasp species.

Parasitic wasps are among the most abundant insects; they are vital to
biodiversity and contribute to biological control of agricultural pests
(Narendran 2001; Rodriguez et al. 2013). A common strategy for
reproductive success of parasitic wasps is suppression of immunity in
their larval hosts. Parasitic wasps produce viruses or virus-like particles
in tissues associated with the ovary. Wasps of the Ichneumonoidea
superfamily produce symbiotic polydnaviruses (PDVs), which package
circular dsDNA. PDV (Bracovirus (BV) in braconid wasps; Ichnovirus
(IV) in ichneumonid wasps) genomes are integrated within the wasp
genome as islands of viral genes. Upon oviposition, PDVs suppress host
immunity. BVs and IVs derive from nudivirus and large DNA cyto-
plasmic viruses, respectively (reviewed in Strand and Burke 2015;
Drezen et al. 2017; Gauthier et al. 2018, and references therein).
Immune-suppressive virus-like particles (VLPs) (e.g., VcVLPs in
the ichneumonid Venturia canescens and FaENVs in the braconid
Fopius arisanus) lack proviral DNA segments, but are of viral origin

and transfer virulence proteins into host cells (Pichon et al. 2015;
Burke et al. 2018). Viral genes encoding VLP proteins are either
dispersed in the wasp genome (as in VcVLP) or present in discrete
genomic areas (as in FaENV). Thus, various independent viral endo-
genization events have been important for successful parasitism by
these wasps (Strand and Burke 2015; Gauthier et al. 2018).
Here, we focus on immune-suppressive particles of ﬁgitid wasps
in the genus Leptopilina, that infect Drosophila spp. and are gaining
importance as models for natural host-parasite interactions (Keebaugh
and Schlenke 2014). Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh), L. victoriae (Lv), and
L. boulardi (Lb) produce VLPs in their venom glands. The VLPs of
Leptopilina spp. and their proteins have been linked to parasite success
(Rizki et al. 1990; Dupas et al. 1996; Morales et al. 2005; Labrosse et al.
2005; Chiu et al. 2006; Heavner et al. 2014). Evidence for DNA in
Leptopilina VLPs is lacking, and because of the absence of a published
wasp genome, the chromosomal vs. extrachromosomal location of
MSEV protein genes is not known. Our goals here are (a) to describe
additional proteins in the MSEV proteome and examine their relation-
ship with PDV and other viral proteins, and (b) determine whether
MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome.
We recently described 161 proteins in the VLPs from two Lh strains
in three classes: conserved eukaryotic with cellular function (Class 1),
infection- and immunity-related (Class 2), and unannotated (novel)
without similarity to known proteins (Class 3) (Heavner et al. 2017).
Class 1 proteins include several vesicular transport and endomembrane
system proteins. Class 2 proteins include predicted modulators of immune
response, e.g., metalloendopeptidases, RhoGAPs, a knottin-like protein,
and a new family of prokaryotic-like GTPases whose genes lack introns. A
striking example of Class 3 proteins is p40, with three-dimensional struc-
tural similarity to Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) needle-tip proteins,
IpaD/SipD/BipD from Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella, Shigella and
Burkholderia. Earlier results have indicated that the p40 gene (unlike the
GTPase genes) is expected to have introns. These results suggested that Lh
VLPs have novel properties with elements of the prokaryotic and
eukaryotic secretion systems and possess a functionally diverse array
of immune-suppressive proteins. We therefore renamed VLPs as
Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs). Their variable mor-
phologies distinguish them from ordered PDV morphologies. Addi-
tionally, genes encoding abundant MSEV proteins p40 and GTPase
are present even in antibiotic-treated wasps. These results favored a
non-microbial nature for MSEVs (Heavner et al. 2017).
Here, we present an analysis of an additional 246 proteins from the
Lh 14 MSEV proteome to obtain a more comprehensive description. A
combined analysis of these and previous results reinforce the idea that
the MSEV proteome is enriched in exosomal proteins and that Class
3 proteins are not shared with either Lb or an unrelated Ganaspis spp.
Whole-body transcriptome of adult Lh wasps validated the expression
of the MSEV genes. De novo genomic assembly and analyses revealed
90% of conserved Insecta Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortho-
logs (BUSCOs), as well as a majority (375/407; 90%) of the MSEV
proteins are encoded in the wasp genome. While we cannot rule out a
viral origin of MSEVs, in aggregate, our results provide a clearer un-
derstanding of the current nature of these complex structures and
strengthen the idea that specialized extracellular vesicles transfer wasp
virulence factors and other parasite proteins into Drosophila host cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Insects
Isogenized Lh strains New York (NY; (Chiu and Govind 2002; Chiu
et al. 2006)) and Lh 14 (Schlenke et al. 2007), were raised on the y w
strain of D. melanogaster that were reared on standard cornmeal, yeast,
and agar ﬂy food at 25 as described by Small et al. (2012). Adult wasps
were collected from parasitized hosts, 25 days after infection at 25.
Male and female wasps were stored on ﬂy food with 70% honey on
“buzz” plugs.
Analysis of MSEV super-set ORFs
Previously undescribed open reading frames (ORFs) from the Lh
14 MSEV proteome and sequenced as part of Heavner et al. (2017)
(PXD005632) are analyzed in the context of the published female ab-
dominal (Goecks et al. 2013) and whole body (this study) Lh 14 tran-
scriptomes. We have not observed any difference in venom activities of
Lh 14 and Lh NY (Morales et al. 2005; Schlenke et al. 2007), or in wasp
success under laboratory conditions. The Lh 14 ORFs were aligned
against transcripts from BioProject: PRJNA202370, Accession number
GAJC0000000 (Goecks et al. 2013) as previously described in Heavner
et al. (2017). Proteins with an ORF and a transcript were run through
the BLAST2GO (v 5.2; downloaded June 2018) annotation pipeline
with an E-value threshold of 1x1027 (Conesa et al. 2005; Götz et al.
2008). Results were organized and classiﬁed based on Gene Ontology
(GO) terms from UniProt and InterPro (Ashburner et al. 2000; Jones
et al. 2014; Uniport Consortium 2015; The Gene Ontology Consortium
2019). Proteins were considered “virulence-related” based on GO terms
indicating involvement with infection, host evasion, inﬂammation, and
immune response. ORFs that did not return results via BLAST or
InterProScan (Class 3 proteins) were run through Conserved Domain
Search (CDD) on NCBI (version 3.16) (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2017).
The E-value cut off for CDD search was 1x1022. Proteins were
considered to have a signal peptide if one was predicted using
Phobeus and Signal P (Käll et al. 2004; Käll et al. 2007; Nielsen
2017; Almagro Armenteros et al. 2019). Transmembrane domains
were considered to be present if they were predicted using Phobeus
and TMHMM (Sonnhammer et al. 1998; Krogh et al. 2001; Käll et al.
2004; Käll et al. 2007).
The GhostKOALA algorithm (Kanehisa et al. 2016) was used to assign
KEGG ortholog (KO) numbers for the MSEV superset protein sequences.
If a primary KO number failed to be assigned by GhostKOALA, a sec-
ondary number assignment with a score .= 50 was used. Redundant KO
numbers were excluded.
MSEV proteins were included in the enrichment analyses only if a
human ortholog exists; the gene identiﬁers for human orthologs were
obtained from the MSEV KO and the UniProt mapping utility (Li et al.
2015; Uniport Consortium 2015). (Human orthologs were chosen
because a robust proportion of Vesiclepedia’s data are derived from
human vesicle proteomes.) The orthologs of human genes were an-
alyzed for enrichment with the FunRich algorithm (Pathan et al.
2015; Pathan et al. 2017) against the Vesiclepedia database (Kalra
et al. 2012; Pathan et al. 2019).
Finally, the MSEV proteome was used as a query using BLASTp for
the following databases: “non-redundant” (nr), nr restricted to Taxid:
Viridae (10239), nr restricted to Taxid: Polydnaviridae (10482), and nr
restricted to Taxid: Unclassiﬁed Polydnaviridae (40273) (E-value thresh-
old: 1.0x1023, %ID minimum: 20%, performed 04/16/2019). tBLASTn
of L. boulardi and G. hookeri (previously called Ganaspis spp. 1) (Goecks
et al. 2013) transcriptomes was performed on 03/10/2019; the thresh-
old for homologs in Lb and G. hookeri were 25% ID and an E-value of
1.0x10210.
Genomes sequencing and assembly
Library preparations, sequencing reactions, and associated validations
were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainﬁeld, NJ, USA).

Genomic DNA was extracted from 50 mg of tissue (100 wasps) of
Lh males and females separately using mixed bead beating and Pure-
Link Genomic DNA extraction kits following manufacturer’s protocol.
Quantiﬁcation of extracted DNA was performed using Nanodrop and
Qubit2.0 Fluorometer (Live Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Integ-
rity of genomic DNA was veriﬁed by gel electrophoresis (0.6% agarose).
DNA libraries were prepared for each wasp gender by acoustic shearing
fragmentation using a Covaris S220. Fragments were end repaired and
adenylated prior to adapter ligation on 39 ends (NEB NextUltra DNA
Library Preparation kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Enrich-
ment and indexing of adapter-ligated DNA was done through
limited cycle PCR. DNA library validation was performed using
TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Libraries
were quantiﬁed using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer.
RealtimePCR(AppliedBiosystems,Carlsbad,CA,USA)wasusedto
quantify DNA molar mass for each library before multiplexing in equal
molarmass.DNAlibrariesweresequencedusinga2x150paired-end(PE)
conﬁguration on one lane on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Image analysis and
base calling were performed using the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) on
the HiSeq instrument.
The average size of inserts (without adaptors) in the Illumina library
was 300-350 bp. De novo assembly of reads and scaffolding of contigs
was performed using ABySS 2.2 (Jackman et al. 2017) by the New York
Genome Center. De novo assembly of combined male/female genome
was performed using Platanus-allee (Kajitani et al. 2019) and scaffold-
ing was improved using AGOUTI (Zhang et al. 2016) on the University
of Delaware’s BIOMIX cluster.
Sequences from Drosophila-associated bacteria such as Wolbachia
spp., Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Lactobacillus plantarum were
identiﬁed in both assemblies. Wolbachia are endosymbionts of
many insects including Leptopilina spp. (Pannebakker et al.
2004; Werren et al. 2008; Gueguen et al. 2012). Lactobacilli and
Acetobacter are symbionts and commensals of sugar-consuming
insects (Crotti et al. 2010; Engel and Moran 2013). Among the
three bacterial species, Wolbachia sequences were the most abun-
dant. BLASTx analysis showed that predicted genes from Wolba-
chia scaffolds were associated with Wolbachia proteins in
GenBank. These bacterial and mitochondrial sequence-containing
scaffolds were identiﬁed during the NCBI submission process and
were manually removed from the submission.
Evaluation of genome assemblies
Assemblies made with ABySS and Platanus-allee with AGOUTI were
run through QUAST v4.0 (Mikheenko et al. 2016) to determine scaffold
number, N50, and GC%. All assemblies were examined for conserved
genes and orthologs with BUSCO v9 (Simão et al. 2015; Waterhouse
et al. 2017) using the Insecta set and training parameters set to “Naso-
nia”. NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used to compare selected scaffolds
produced from male and female genome assemblies (Johnson et al.
2008; Camacho et al. 2009). E-value threshold was set at 1x1027.
E-values of alignments were considered acceptable if within the range
of 0 to 1x10210.
K-mer analysis was performed using the K-mer Analysis Toolkit
(KAT) (Mapleson et al. 2016) and heat maps were used to compare
multiplicity (coverage plus repeats) of K-mers to GC content of the
reads, coloring bins according to the number of distinct K-mers in each.
This analysis was used to determine whether there were separate clus-
ters of multiplicity/GC content that might arise from different sources,
such as contamination. BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990; Camacho et al.
2009; Johnson et al. 2008) was used to search for homologs of a random
sample of genomic scaffolds to which reads from each cluster mapped.
The joint assembly of the Lh 14 genome was compared to the pub-
lished L. clavipes genome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205 (Kraaijeveld
et al. 2016)) through maps of 27-mer multiplicity vs. GC content.
Finally, 27-mer multiplicity/GC content of the scaffolds (9.6 Mb)
containing MSEV genes was compared to a random subset of scaf-
folds (9.6 Mb) without MSEV genes. Statistical differences between
Lh 14 and L. clavipes genomes and between MSEV-gene containing
scaffolds and non-MSEV-gene containing scaffolds were calculated us-
ing a multivariate Cramér test (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996; Baringhaus
and Franz 2004; Franz 2019).
Gene predictions, gene annotation, and viral
gene searches
Gene predictions were performed on parallel and anti-parallel
strands using AUGUSTUS (v3.3.1; August 2018) (Stanke et al.
2004; Stanke and Morgenstern 2005; Keller et al. 2011) with the
Nasonia training set. The AUGUSTUS readout was separated into
mRNA, coding DNA sequence (CDS), and translations by gffread
(Trapnell et al. 2012).
Gene predictions were annotated by performing a BLASTx of all
gene predictions against the entire nr database (Downloaded on
January 2019) and InterProScan on the University of Delaware
BIOMIX Cluster before using BLAST2GO (Conesa et al. 2005;
Götz et al. 2008) to ﬁnish annotation based on BLASTx and Inter-
ProScan results.
NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used on a local machine to search
predictions and scaffolds, cutoff was %ID .70%, E-value , 1E-50, and
query coverage . 70%. MSEV genes and 1x1022 for Polydnavirus
and Nudivirus proteins. Family Polydnaviridae and Nudiviridae
protein sequences for the 11 species available on OrthoDB v9 were
downloaded on February 2019 (Johnson et al. 2008; Camacho
et al. 2009).
Whole-body transcriptome sequencing and assembly
Total RNA extraction, library preparations, sequencing reactions,
and bioinformatics analysis were conducted at GENEWIZ, INC
(South Plainﬁeld, NJ, USA). RNA was extracted from frozen tissue
with the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Universal mini kit using manufac-
turer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted
RNA was quantiﬁed using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and its integrity
was checked with the 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA, USA).
RNAsampleswereenrichedformRNAusingOligod(T)beads.RNA
sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA
Library Prep Kit for Illumina following manufacturer’s instructions
(NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The sequencing libraries were validated
by using the Agilent TapeStation. Quantiﬁcation was performed using
the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems,
Wilimington, MA, USA).
Sequencing libraries were clustered on a single lane of a ﬂow cell and
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument using a 2x150 PE
conﬁguration. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the
HCS. Raw sequence data (.bcl ﬁles) was converted into fastq ﬁles and
de-multiplexed using Illumina’s bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mismatch
was allowed for index sequence identiﬁcation.
The Trinity v2.5 (Grabherr et al. 2011), de novo assembler was used
to assemble the Lh 14 transcripts. The de novo assembled transcriptome
was created with a minimum contig length of 200 bp per sample.
Transrate v1.0.3 (Smith-Unna et al. 2016) was used to generate statistics
for the de novo assembled transcriptome. EMBOSS tools getorf were
then used to ﬁnd the ORFs within the de novo assembled transcriptome.

The de novo transcriptome assembly was then annotated using Di-
amond BLASTx (Buchﬁnk et al. 2015).
The transcriptome reads were mapped to the genomic scaffolds for
downstreamanalyses using HISAT2 or BWA (Li and Durbin 2009; Kim
et al. 2015).

extracted using Plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced (GEN-
EWIZ, INC. South Plainﬁeld, NJ, USA). Sequences were aligned using
NCBI BLAST+ (Johnson et al. 2008; Camacho et al. 2009) and Clustal
Omega (Li et al. 2015). Expected PCR band sizes were determined
using SerialCloner (v2.6.1).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The MSEV proteome superset
A comparative study of the proteomes of the MSEVs from Lh 14 and Lh
NY strains previously generated a list of 161 “common” MSEV proteins
(Heavner et al. 2017). More than 90% of the 161 proteins are part of
the Lh 14 MSEV proteome. To describe MSEVs more completely, we
characterized a larger set of 407 MSEV proteins from Lh 14 (161 com-
mon and 246 Lh 14) and deﬁne this set as the Lh MSEV “super-set”
(Figure 1A). Key results from annotation-based classiﬁcation, analy-
sis for signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain, and presence/
absence of proteins in related wasps are summarized below and in
Table S1.
The presence/absence of signal peptide (SP) alone, or SP with/
without the transmembrane (TM) domain(s) in MSEV proteins reveals
their possible location (i.e., potentially secreted into the venom gland
lumen or associated with MSEV membrane). We therefore searched
the 246 Lh 14 proteins for SP and TM domains. Of the 246 proteins,
55 (22.35%) have a predicted SP domain, 37 (15.04%) have a predicted
TM domain, while 6 (2.44%) have both a predicted SP and TM domain.
After annotation, we found that a majority (183/246 or 75%) of the
246 proteins can be classiﬁed as core eukaryotic cell biology proteins
(Class 1); 13/246 (5%) proteins as virulence- and immunity-related
based on associated GO terms (Ashburner et al. 2000; The Gene On-
tology Consortium 2019) (Class 2); and 50/246 or 20% as novel se-
quences without high conﬁdence annotation (Class 3) (Table S1). A
presence/absence analysis of these 246 proteins in published tran-
scriptomes (Goecks et al. 2013) of Lb or a more distantly related wasp,
G. hookeri (for thresholds see Methods) revealed the following: only
43/246 (17%) Lh MSEV proteins are expected to be found in Lb and/
or G. hookeri (Table S1). Of these, 33/43 (77%) proteins were in Class
1 but only 7/43 (16%) and 3/43 (7%) were in Class 2 and Class
3 categories, respectively. These results support the idea that, multiple
but different, infection strategies and/or host evasion strategies might
exist among different wasps infecting the same hosts.
While most of the Class 1 proteins were annotated as ribosomal or
mitochondrial-related, a few were described as integral membrane
proteins, vesicle trafﬁcking protein SEC22b (E-value: 6.22E-145),
and the ion channels sideroﬂexin 1 and 2 (E-value: 0). We also
identiﬁed an apolipophorin (E-value: 1.02E-7) (Table S1). The pres-
ence of these membrane-associated proteins reinforces the vesicular
nature of MSEVs.
Examples of Class 2 proteins include the neural/ectodermal devel-
opment factor IMP-L2 (E-value: 5.29x10250) and a protein involved in
pain reception, CG9231 (E-value: 4.39x10215). A viral-like Diedel pro-
tein (E-value: 1.77x1027), viral Enhancin (E-value: 6.02x1025),

Lh MSEV Proteins are Encoded in Genome

It is possible that these MSEV proteins modulate the hosts’ immune
responses and/or inﬂuence host development to facilitate successful
parasitism.
Within Class 3, 45 proteins (90%) lacked BLASTp and InterProScan
results. However, ConservedDomain Database (CDD) (Marchler-Bauer
et al. 2017) searches returned 9 hits identifying potentially functional
domains (Table 1). This included (a) a CD99L2 like antigen (%ID: 24%,
E-value: 3x1023), (b) a DEAD-like helicases superfamily member
(%ID: 22%, E-value 2x1024) and (c) a herpes outer envelope glycopro-
tein 350 (gp350), (%ID: 28%, E-value: 4x1023) (Table 1).
A BLASTp DELTA-BLAST of the potential gp350 domain against
the nr database specifying “Vira” (taxid: 10239) under organism
resulted in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus enve-
lope glycoprotein (%ID: 30%, E-value: 2.5x1021), Lymphocryptovirus
Macaca gp350 (%ID: 29%, E-value: 7.2x1021), and Gallid Alphaher-
pesvirus 1 envelope glycoprotein J (%ID: 26%, E-value: 1.2) as top hits.
BLASTp DELTA-BLAST of the potential gp350 domain against the nr
database for Hymenoptera yielded an uncharacterized protein as the
best hit (%ID: 24%, E-value: 8x1026) in the ant Vollenhovia emeryi.
This ant protein is predicted to contain calcium-binding EGF domains.
The second hit in this search is from N. vitripennis for a predicted
mucin-3A like glycoprotein (Gendler and Spicer 1995) (%ID: 24%,
E-value: 2x1024). Interestingly, transcripts related to the potential Lh
gp350-like protein are not found in the Lb or G. hookeri transcriptomes
(Table S1) (Goecks et al. 2013). Presence of this gp350-like protein
in Lh MSEVs, but its absence in Lb MSEVs, suggests that it some-
how contributes to differences in Lh/Lb host-parasite interactions
and is therefore worthy of future studies. Complement receptor
type 2 (CR2) in human B lymphocytes interacts with gp350 during
Epstein-Barr infection (Young et al. 2008) and ﬁnding a veriﬁed
homolog of CR2 in Drosophila hosts would be interesting in future
research.
Because more than 200 proteins have now been added to the
previously described MSEV proteome (Heavner et al. 2017), we
re-evaluated our previous enrichment analysis. In an ortholog-based
comparison of the superset to human extracellular vesicle (EV) pro-
teomes in Vesiclepedia (the most current and robust source of EV
data (Kalra et al. 2012)), we found that the largest proportion of
superset proteins (49%) are proteins speciﬁcally associated with
exosomes (Figure 1B). In human and mouse EV proteomes, mi-
tochondrial and ribosomal proteins are enriched (Kalra et al.
2012). Accordingly, protein components of mitochondria (e.g.,
respiratory chain) and ribosomes (e.g., large and small subunit pro-
teins) are found to be highly enriched in the Lh MSEV superset.
However, we found that the signiﬁcance of the enrichment was higher
between the superset and exosomal proteins than mitochondrial or
ribosomal proteins (Figure 1C). These results demonstrate the simi-
larities in the protein proﬁles of MSEVs and EVs.
Do Lh MSEVs contain homologs of PDV or
viral proteins?
Even though ﬁgitid Leptopilina wasps are distantly related to PDV-
containing Ichneumonid and Braconid wasps (Misof et al. 2014;
Strand and Burke 2015), an association of PDV-like viruses in ﬁgitid
wasps cannot be discounted because of shared evolutionary history.
Recent publications have identiﬁed capsid-less VLPs in Ichneumonidae
wasps (Volkoff et al. 2010; Pichon et al. 2015; Burke et al. 2018) and it is
possible that Lh MSEVs have a similar viral origin. We therefore ana-
lyzed the Lh MSEV proteome superset against the GenBank PDV
database, and then against its entire Viridae database.
To identify false positives, MSEV proteins with positive PDV hits
(E-values were less than 1.0x1023, %ID was 20% or greater, and query
coverage was 30% or higher) were also searched against the unrestricted
nr database to compare relatedness. If an MSEV protein is similar to a
viral or virus-related PDV protein, we expected that, in the unrestricted
nr database search, the MSEV query sequence would align again with
the same viral subject sequences, but with a lower E-value (Table S2).
For PDV searches (Taxid: 10482 and Taxid: 40273), four proteins
returned hits with E-values better than 1.0x10220 and query coverage
greater than 30%. Three of these hits are conserved proteins (cyto-
chrome P450 and histone 4) while the fourth result identiﬁed an
uncharacterized Cotesia congregata bracovirus (CcBV) protein (%ID:
31.08%, E-value: 1.38x10217, query coverage: 77%) (Table S2). The
unbiased BLASTp search against the entire nr database however had
better results against eukaryotic proteins (E values: 0 to 2.0x1027 and %
ID from 100 to 56.25) (Table S2). In fact, the query that yielded the
CcBV protein was better matched to a eukaryotic ribonuclease (%ID:
26.06%, E-value 1.14x10216, query coverage: 84%) (Table S2). These
results suggest that MSEV sequence similarities with PDV proteins may
not be signiﬁcant.
We also searched the Lh MSEV superset for presence of L. boulardi
Filamentous Virus (LbFV) homologs (LbFV is a behavior manipulating
virus of Lb (Varaldi et al. 2006; Patot et al. 2012)). Of LbFV’s 108 genes,
13 are present in genomes of Lb, Lh and related species, and the 13 tran-
scripts are expressed in the Lb venom gland (Di Giovanni et al. 2019).
Within our thresholds, we obtained only three (of 13) sequences with
similarity to LbFV ORFs. However, these three Lh MSEV proteins, with
hits for LbFV sequences obtained better scoring hits in the unrestricted
n■Table 1 CDD-search results of MSEV “un-annotated” proteins in the super-set. MSEV ORFs that completed the BLAST2GO pipeline
and did not return any results were run through the NCBI CDD-Search Version 3.16 (Accessed: Aug. 2018). Of 45 queries, only 9 returned
hits with threshold set to 1x1022. The ninth result came from a search with E-value threshold set to 1. Results listed are all unique, high
scoring hits for each ORF that returned hits from the search

nr database, suggesting that the Lh MSEV proteins are not highly re-
lated to the LbFV proteins (Table S2).
WhencomparingMSEVproteins tothe entiretyof Viridae,a total of
35 MSEV proteins had hits with %IDs ranging from 30 to 71% and
E-values ranging from 1.0x10222 to 1.0x102178 (Table S2). However, a
BLASTp search against the entire nr database found that proteins with
results for viral hits had better scores when searched against the entire
nr database, indicating that while viral hits are possible, they are not the
best match (Table S2). This result, in addition to the fact that 372 other
MSEV proteins (including the Diedel and Enhancin (Table S1)) did not
return viral hits, would indicate that a majority of MSEV proteins are
not closely related to viral proteins.
The whole-body transcriptome contains expressed
MSEV transcripts
We performed a mixed-gender whole-body transcriptome sequencing
and de novo assembly of Lh transcripts. This assembly generated
104,066 transcripts. This dataset is more than three times larger than
the published data derived from abdomens of female wasps that has
31,400 transcripts (Goecks et al. 2013). A BLAST analysis of the female
abdominal transcripts against the male/female whole-body transcripts
showed that a majority (21,493/31,400, 68.4%) were present in the latter
data set.
We searched the whole-body transcriptome for MSEV protein
coding sequences using tBLASTn. Of 407 MSEV superset proteins,
we identiﬁed transcripts for 371 (91.1%) proteins. Despite the 9%
discrepancy (likely due to differences in expression levels due to differ-
ent experimental conditions), these results largely verify the transcript
data from (Goecks et al. 2013) that we have based our proteomic
analyses on. Of the 371 MSEV transcripts identiﬁed, 233 (63%) encode
Class 1, 44 (12%) encode Class 2, and 94/371 (25%) encode Class
3 proteins.
Assembly of the Lh genome
We separately sequenced Lh 14 male and female genomic DNA and
assembled the paired-end reads de novo, using ABySS (Jackman et al.
2017). These assemblies have a modest scaffold N50 of 4,800 with more
than 100,000 scaffolds and an average coverage of 87% (Table 2).
Assembly with MaSurCa (Zimin et al. 2013) provided similar results
(data not shown), indicating that our assembly quality is limited likely
due to factors such as large genome size and repetitive sequence regions
(Dominguez Del Angel et al. 2018). Although the N50 values and large
number of scaffolds indicate that the genome is not highly assembled,
we found at least 80% of BUSCOs shared in the Insecta set in both
assemblies (Table 2, BUSCOs in Table S3).
While still fragmented, a de novo joint assembly of male and female
sequences using Platanus-allee and AGOUTI improved assembly and
scaffolding statistics (N50: 11,906, average coverage 91%). The number
of found BUSCOs in the joint assembly rose to 90% (Table 2, BUSCOs
in Table S3).
Analysis of K-mer multiplicity vs. GC content in the genome se-
quencing reads using the K-mer analysis tool, KAT (Mapleson et al.
2016) showed three possible clusters, although they are difﬁcult to
distinguish (Figure 2A). Cluster 1 has high multiplicity (450-650),
Cluster 2 has lower multiplicity and a wide range of GC content, and
Cluster 3 has the lowest multiplicity and the highest GC content. Clus-
ter 3 overlaps with Cluster 2 making them hard to fully separate.
BLAST searches of a random sample (1,672/4,482) from Cluster 1 con-
tigs hit insect homologs 73% (1,220/1,672) of the time, Acetobacter
homologs 13% (216/1,672) of the time, and then a variety of mostly
Eukaryotic hits. Cluster 2 represents a majority of the wasp genome
(.94%), and blast hits of a random sample (316/68,173) of its contigs
almost exclusively had homologs in Hymenoptera (311/316; 98%) and
mostly in L. heterotoma (227/316; 71%). Cluster 3 is the smallest of the
three and contigs from Cluster 3 had homologs exclusively in Aceto-
bacter (110/110). There was no evidence for contamination from a viral
source or discrete MSEV-speciﬁc set of nucleic acid sequence.
Furthermore, K-mer multiplicity vs. GC content for the joint as-
sembly of the Lh 14 genome (Figure 2B) showed a very similar heat
map to that using the published assembly of L. clavipes (Figure 2C;
Bioproject: PRJNA84205 (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016)). The two genomes
have highly similar 27-mer/GC proﬁles that do not differ statistically
(multivariate Cramér test statistic = 114,119, P = 0.73, number boot-
strap-replicates = 1000). The L. heterotoma assembly has 27-mers with
approximately twice the multiplicity of those found in L. clavipes, which
may represent increased repeat content in L. heterotoma and is sup-
ported by an assembly size over 200 Mb larger than the L. clavipes
genome (463 Mb vs. 255 Mb) (Kraaijeveld et al. 2016).
MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome
Using our annotation pipeline, 28,481 predicted genes were annotated.
Within the annotated genes, we found 8 genes for the body color yellow,

3 major royal jelly protein (mrjp) genes, 25 odorant receptor/odorant
binding protein coding genes, and 94 gene predictions for cytochrome
P450. Some of these nuclear genes are not only involved in development
and cellular processes, but are also included in the MSEV proteome (Table
S1 and (Heavner et al. 2017)). A search of gene predictions for MSEV
proteins via tBLASTn identiﬁed 325 of 407 (80%) MSEV sequences (Table
3). Of these, 153/407 (38%) had a percent identity of 95% or greater.
Presence or removal of scaffolds with bacterial DNA sequences from
either the separate male/female or the joint assembly did not affect this
number, supporting the nuclear location of a majority of the MSEV genes.
As gene prediction software can potentially miss genes (Wang et al.
2004), we searched the genomic scaffolds directly for MSEV-coding se-
quence regions using known protein sequences as queries via tBLASTn
before and after removal of bacterial sequences. In both cases, 375/407
(92%) MSEV sequences were at least 70% complete as determined by
query coverage (Table 3). Of these, 191/407 (47%) had a percent identity
of 95% or greater.
ThescaffoldscontainingMSEVgenes(Fig.S1A)werealsocompared
to a random subset of scaffolds without MSEV genes (Fig S1B) for their
27-mer/GC proﬁles. These appeared to not differ statistically (multivar-
iate Cramér test statistic = 3755, P = 0.80, number bootstrap-replicates =
1000), indicating that the MSEV genes lie on scaffolds that resemble the
rest of the genome.
Characterization of select MSEV genes
We spot checked small portions of the genome for gene structure
predictions of MSEV virulence protein genes SmGTPse01 (Class 2)
and p40 (Class 3). For this, we sequenced PCR products of gDNA corre-
sponding to these genes.
The MSEV SmGTPase01 has prokaryotic-like GTPase domains and
its gene is expected to lack introns (Heavner et al. 2017). The predicted
SmGTPase01 CDS spans 936 bp, which contains the functional GTPase
domain (Heavner 2018). Scaffolds from male and female genomes
conﬁrmed the absence of coding region introns (data not shown).
We hypothesized that primers in 59 and 39 untranslated regions (UTRs)
should amplify the exact fragment from cDNA/gDNA as template based
on manual characterization of the SmGTPase01 locus (Heavner 2018)
(Figure 3A). This prediction was borne out and we ampliﬁed an 873 bp

fragment only from female cDNA and from both male and female
gDNA (Figure 3C). The sequenced PCR products were identical to
corresponding sequence within the assembly and the published tran-
script sequence from Goecks et al. (data not shown).
The p40 gene encodes a protein that is structurally similar to T3SS
bacterial needle-tip proteins IpaD/SipD from Shigella and Salmonella.
However, p40’s genomic sequence is expected to have introns (Heavner
et al. 2017). The full p40 gene was computationally assembled and
predicted within both male and female genomes. Primers designed
for p40’s 59 and 39 UTRs (Goecks et al. 2013; Ramroop 2016) (Figure
3B), allowed ampliﬁcation of p40’s 939 bp cDNA only in preparations
from female wasp extracts, but gDNA bands at 1,630 bp were detected
from reactions when either male or female genome was used as tem-
plate, indicating the presence of introns (Figure 3D). Sequencing the
cloned cDNA product from females conﬁrmed the published cDNA
sequence (Heavner et al., 2017). We also cloned and sequenced the
gDNA products from male and female wasps and found the sequences
to be identical (data not shown).
Unlike the well-characterized Drosophila hosts, the biology and
molecular-genetics of their parasitic wasps have remained relatively
obscure with only recent characterizations of Leptopilina and Ganaspis
spp. (Melk and Govind 1999; Colinet et al. 2013; Goecks et al. 2013;
Heavner et al. 2013; Mortimer et al. 2013; Heavner et al. 2017; Di
Giovanni et al. 2019). Our proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic
results here expand the available information on L. heterotoma. Bio-
informatics analysis of the additional MSEV proteins does not alter the
initial interpretation of the original 161 proteins. Genomic sequencing
and analysis of scaffolds reveals that more than 92% of the MSEV genes
reside on the wasp genome. We did not ﬁnd evidence for MSEV gene
association with endosymbiont or commensal bacterial DNA. We sus-
pect that the remaining 8% are also nuclear genes and this associ-
ation will be conﬁrmed in higher quality assemblies. Altogether, these
results strongly suggest that, like other subcellular structures, MSEVs
are encoded in the wasp nuclear genome.
The cellular nature of Lh vesicles is likely to be shared by closely related
Lv and Lb wasps. Our previous work has shown that the overall morphol-
ogies of Lh and Lv MSEVs are similar (Morales et al. 2005; Chiu et al.
2006). However, this is not the case for Lb MSEVs; different Lb strains
have varying MSEV morphologies (Dupas et al. 1996; Gueguen et al.
2011; Wan et al. 2019). Interpretation of their identity also varies. For
example, Di Giovanni et al. (2019) contend that MSEVs/VLPs are de-
rived from a virus ancestral to the LbFV. Our analysis of the expanded
proteomic superset does not lend strong support to this line of thinking.

Lh MSEV Proteins are Encoded in Genome
|
9

We did not ﬁnd convincing evidence of PDV or other viral
structural proteins in the Lh MSEV proteome. However, we cannot
discount that MSEVs have a viral origin as our analysis is limited by
the fragmentation of the genome. It is also possible that a virus related
to MSEVs may not have been identiﬁed to date. Mechanistically,
eukaryotic viruses and vesicles share cellular pathways involving the
endomembrane systems of their cells of origin or their target cells
(Nolte-‘t Hoen et al. 2016), leading to overlap in protein functionality,
but not necessarily origin. Thus, at least some of the Class 1 proteins
in the MSEV proteome may be central to MSEV biogenesis in the
wasp or for their interactions with the host hemocytes’ endomem-
brane machinery despite potentially being related to viruses. It is
noteworthy that energy metabolism genes appear to be involved in
rapid speciation and adaptation to new environments (Gershoni et al.
2009; Lane 2009), raising the possibility that MSEV mitochondrial
proteins might contribute to this process. How Lh MSEVs are func-
tionally similar to other insect or mammalian EVs remains to be
explored experimentally. Functional characterization of predicted in-
fection and immunity Class 2 proteins should explain the immune-
suppressive strategies of these wasps. RNA interference, infection
assays, and other experimental strategies should make this line of
inquiry feasible.
Functional assignments are difﬁcult for the unannotated Class
3 proteins. These are likely to be quite interesting, due to their
different expression proﬁles in Lh vs. Lb and G. hookeri species.
This difference in expression may stem either from cis changes in
their regulatory sequences, or from absence of these genes in the Lb
or G. hookeri genomes. Recent comparative genomics analysis has
shown that over 40% of venom genes in the closely-related species
N. vitripennis and N. giraulti have diverged signiﬁcantly and up to
25% of venom genes are speciﬁc to a species (Martinson et al. 2017).
A proteomic analysis of the venom genes of Leptopilina spp. and a
molecular understanding of their expression will provide insights
into how key activities within MSEVs evolved to parasitize the range
of fruit ﬂy hosts.
A key question regarding Lh virulence proteins critical to wasp
success is whether their genes reside in a discrete region of the genome
like a “virulence island” found in some microbial genomes (Dobrindt
et al. 2004; Gal-Mor and Finlay 2006), or whether some genes are
dispersed within the genome, while others occur in one or more clusters
as in wasps with PDVs (Volkoff et al. 2010; Pichon et al. 2015). More
complete assemblies, scaffolded to the level of chromosomes, will de-
scribe the genome-wide distribution of these genes in Lh and re-
lated wasps. Key MSEV genes could serve as genetic markers in
future studies. Comparative genomics will uncover additional gene
family members of MSEV proteins in other Leptopilina wasps and
enable the development of new functional genomics tools such as
CRISPR-disrupted mutant alleles made in N. vitripennis (Werren
et al. 2009; Siebert et al. 2015; Li et al. 2017b; Li et al. 2017a). These
approaches will open new avenues for understanding the biology of
this host-parasite model.
