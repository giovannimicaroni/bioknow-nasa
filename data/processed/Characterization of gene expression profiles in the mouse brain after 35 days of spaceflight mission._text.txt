It has been proposed that neuroinﬂammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress.
The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression proﬁles associated with neuroinﬂammation, neuronal
function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space
Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were
collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression
proﬁles in the spaceﬂight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) signiﬁcantly segregates the habitat ground
control (GC) group from ﬂight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inﬂammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were
signiﬁcantly altered by ﬂight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin
sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were signiﬁcantly downregulated. Here we report that signiﬁcantly altered immune
reactions may be closely associated with spaceﬂight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.

INTRODUCTION
The spaceﬂight environment is characterized mainly by ultraviolet
and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychologi-
cal stressors. These conditions present a signiﬁcant hazard to
spaceﬂight crews during the course of mission activities. The
susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to spaceﬂight-
induced changes can be particularly devastating to the health,
mission performance, and quality of life of the spaceﬂight crew
both acutely and chronically. The health risk from spaceﬂight-
induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular
effects are a chief concern, examples are intracranial ﬂuid
redistribution results in alteration of brain perfusion, neurovestib-
ular problems, and cognitive alterations in astronauts1,2 caused by
microgravity and/or strong gravitational changes during ascent and
re-entry. Long-duration spaceﬂights reportedly induce immune
dysregulation, which is considered a risk to astronaut safety and
mission success3. Studies to date have demonstrated the altered
distribution of peripheral leukocytes, a diminished function of
speciﬁc leukocyte subpopulations, and skewed cytokine proﬁles in
many astronauts3. Many biomarkers associated with neuroinﬂam-
mation following space radiation and space stressors in rodents
and humans have been identiﬁed4–8. However, the precise nature
of immune dysregulation during spaceﬂight is not well understood.
Evidence suggests that acute exposure to galactic cosmic rays
(GCRs) induce detrimental CNS changes including an increased
level of neuroinﬂammation, neuronal damage and cognitive
deﬁcits similar to accelerated aging9–12. Ionizing radiation has been
shown to elicit neuroinﬂammation through direct activation of
microglia cells13 and through the increased inﬁltration of immune
and inﬂammatory cells through the damaged blood-brain barrier
(BBB)14. Study also showed that both microgravity encountered by
astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on earth induce
changes in brain structure and function15. Microgravity induces a
tremendous shift in body ﬂuids, an increase in brain ﬂuid and
alterations in tissue perfusion16. Space microgravity modulates the
expression of cellular molecules, and alters pro-inﬂammation
cytokine secretion17. Neuroinﬂammation is also a central patholo-
gical feature of several acute and chronic brain diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis18.
The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to its high oxygen
consumption19, the content of oxidizable unsaturated lipids20 and
low levels of anti-oxidant defenses21. Oxidative injury has been
implicated as a causative or contributory factor in a number of
neurodegenerative conditions, including aging, and ischemic,
traumatic damage22–26. Our preliminary studies have shown that
spaceﬂight and ionizing radiation cause prolonged oxidative
stress and endothelial dysfunction that may lead to chronic
inﬂammation and adverse remodeling27–30. However, our knowl-
edge about the mechanism and consequences of spaceﬂight
condition-induced neuroinﬂammation is very limited. Because of
the complexity of the processes and pathways that lead to
neuroinﬂammation, an in-depth “omics” approach will potentially
provide insight to understanding the impact of environmental
insults on the CNS and the immune function that may have a
long-lasting impact.
The goal of this study was to characterize changes in gene
expression using a neuroinﬂammatory assay panel to investigate
inﬂammation, neuronal function, growth, metabolism, and stress
in mouse brain tissue after spaceﬂight.

signiﬁcant difference) test segregates the ground control (GC) group
from the ﬂight (FLT) group (Table 1). Clusters of genes related to
neuronal function, neuronal cell support, immune function, and
cellular growth and stress were signiﬁcantly altered and organized
based on their protein’s role. SIN3A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene/?term=NM_001110350), SLC2A5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g
ov/gene/?term=NM_019741), MERTK (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/gene/?term=NM_008587), TREM2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/gene/?term=NM_025864), RIPK1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g
ov/gene/?term=NM_009068) are listed in multiple tables as they
are found to play various roles.
Changes of gene expression associated with neuronal
function
Genes directly involved with neuronal function were universally
downregulated and are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 1. Overall, a
picture of decreased neuron plasticity and signaling dysfunction is
painted. Those genes that are involved in neuron support cell
function were also found to be broadly downregulated and are
summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 2. Microglial cell and oligodendrocyte
dysfunction were most pronounced along with the inhibition of
myelin sheath maintenance. Levels of immune and inﬂammation
related gene expression were grossly downregulated except for two
upregulated
genes,
H2-T23
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?
term=NM_010398) and SOX4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?
term=NM_009238). The summary is presented in Table 4 and Fig. 3.
Generally, we see the impairment of genes related to microbial
defense with generalized dysfunction of immunity and disinhibition
of inappropriate inﬂammation. And ﬁnally, genes with roles in cellular
stress and growth are shown in Fig. 4 with downregulation in all
genes with exception of HSPB1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene/?term=NM_013560), GADD45G (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817), CCNG2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.n
ih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635), SESN1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001013370),
and
CDC25A
(https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007658)
which
were
signiﬁcantly upregulated. In general, we see an increased
cellular stress response, growth arrest, and a possible trend
toward more inﬂammatory-associated cell death.
Spaceﬂight-induced changes of pathways
Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inﬂammation,
apoptosis, and metabolism were altered by ﬂight condition using
DEG identiﬁed by Nanostring’s Advanced Analysis module path-
way scoring through correlation-guided gene subsetting, which
functionally annotated groups of genes followed by unsupervised
clustering of samples31. Higher scores compared to normalized
gene expression general means upregulation while lower scores
represent downregulation. Figure 5 summarized pathway results
in a plot of all pathway scores compared to GC controls. Among
these pathways, scores for angiogenesis, cytokine signaling,
epigenetic regulation, and notch signaling were signiﬁcantly
increased which may indicate upregulation of the pathway
(p < 0.05), while scores for innate immune response and oligoden-
drocyte function were greatly reduced in the ﬂight group
compared to the controls which may indicate downregulation of
the pathways (p < 0.05) by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test
(Fig. 6a–f). The score for microglia function was also decreased but
with trending signiﬁcance (p = 0.07) (Fig. 6g).
DISCUSSION
Our data showed robust changes in gene expression proﬁles after
spaceﬂight. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and
migration were signiﬁcantly downregulated. Decreased expression
of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin
sheath maintenance was observed. Downregulation of microglial
gene expression that is important for apoptotic cell clearance,
phagocytosis, and proliferation were evident. Genes supporting
innate immune responses were also downregulated regarding anti-
viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and
bacterial immune response. Expression of genes that are correlated
with DNA damage and cellular stress were upregulated. Many of
these observed changes are in line with our previous ﬁndings in the
brains exposed to simulated spaceﬂight condition. Following
combined exposure of simulated microgravity and radiation, path-
ways involved in neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, the regulation of
neuropeptides, neuronal structure, stress, and cellular signaling are
signiﬁcantly altered29. Gene expression in the brain that was
analyzed after 90 days of simulated microgravity showed many
genes related to catalytic and oxidoreductase activities were
downregulated32. However, in contrary to our ﬁndings, many genes
related to stress, immune response, metabolic process, and/or
inﬂammatory response were signiﬁcantly upregulated in their study.
Duration of environmental stress may play a role in different
response of gene expression proﬁles and pathway regulation.
We saw uniform downregulation of gene expression in our
mouse brain samples directly related to neuron function. NRGN
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029)
coding
for a postsynaptic kinase called neurogranin was found to be
signiﬁcantly reduced in expression. When neurogranin binds
calmodulin, the concentration of calcium needed to transduce a
signal is increased33. Given the downregulation of NRGN (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029)
and
possible
decrease in availability of neurogranin, neurons may become
more sensitive to ﬁring. KCND1(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene/?term=NM_008423) codes for a potassium voltage-gated
channel involved in neurotransmitter release which has been
shown to be inhibited by some types of ROS generating
treatments34–36. Environmental stressor-induced ROS may be
provoking
the
down
regulation
of
KCND1(https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008423). DLG4 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001109752)
is
tran-
scribed into a protein associated with glutamatergic receptor
signaling while also potentially participating in dendritogenesis37.
Its downregulation observed in our assay has the potential to
affect
glutamatergic
neuron
signaling,
and
affect
dendritic
morphology leading to further dysfunction. NLGN2 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_198862)
codes
for
a
molecule which selectively mediates inhibitory synapses38. Its
downregulation may contribute to dysfunction at inhibitory
neuron synapses. Previous study has shown that inﬂammation
induced loss of inhibitory nerve terminals or a redistribution of
presynaptic machinery in inhibitory neurons may increase risk for
developing neurological disease and psychiatric illness, including
seizures and schizophrenia39.
Regarding genes involved in neuron function and plasticity, we
continue to see universal downregulation in the ﬂight tissue
compared
to
GC
controls.
The
gene
SIN3A
(https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350) behaves as
a transcriptional repressor involved in cortical neuron differentia-
tion40. In past studies the silencing of this gene in mice has
shown decreased memory consolidation41. It is possible that
downregulation may have similar, albeit reduced effects on mice
in spaceﬂight. RELN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=
NM_011261) codes for an extracellular matrix serine protease
that regulates microtubule function and plays a role in the
layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex, among other
structures42. Its enzymatic activity that is important for cell
adhesion and reduced transcription, as seen in our ﬂight mice,
could lead to further reduction of nervous system plasticity.

hippocampus43,44. The downregulation of this gene suggests the
decreased ability of cells to utilize fructose as a potential energy
source.
Level of gene expression related to neuron support cells, like
microglial cells and oligodendrocytes were also seen universally
downregulated. Microglia are the resident phagocytes of the innate
immune system in the brain and play an important role in cytokine
production45. Their activation is closely associated with environmental
stress and microglial dysfunction is implicated in many neurological
disorders and diseases46. CSF1R (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?
term=NM_001037859) is a gene coding for a cell-surface receptor
which
binds
to
colony
stimulating
factor-1
(CSF1)
(https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113529) and interleukin-
34
(IL-34)
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_0011
35100)47. CSF1R null mice have been shown to have fewer phagocytic
cells and reduced survival48. Given these ﬁndings we suggest that
ﬂight mice may have a reduced capacity to generate microglial cells
in the nervous system. MERTK (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?
term=NM_008587) creates a kinase protein in innate immune cells
which mediates engulfment of apoptotic cells and acts as a negative
regulator of inﬂammation49–51. Downregulation of this gene may
contribute to immune dysregulation in our ﬂight mice. TREM2
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_031254) codes for a
regulator of microglial chemotaxis and phagocytosis of apoptotic52,53.
In previous in vivo studies with microglial lacking TREM2, decreased
migration to areas of apoptotic neurons was shown54. NCF1 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001286037) codes for a key
subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system55,56. Downregula-
tion suggests a reduced capacity for microglial cells to generate an
effective microbial defense. SLC2A5 codes for the GLUT5 fructose
transporter, as described previously43. With reduced activity, micro-
glial cells may have less capacity to utilize fructose as an energy
source and may be more prone to suffer from metabolic related
dysfunction.
Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. It
plays critical roles in axonal metabolic support, myelination, and
providing nutritional support to neurons57,58. A couple of key
genes involved in the oligodendrocyte function have been
signiﬁcantly downregulated in the ﬂight mice. PLP1 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011123)
codes
for
a
major myelin protein that plays an important role in its formation
and maintenance59. The implication of signiﬁcantly downregu-
lated PLP1 indicates impaired neuron axonal function with the
possibility of long-term neurodegeneration. OPALIN (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_153520) plays a role in
oligodendrocyte cytoskeletal remolding and morphology. Down-
regulation of this gene observed in our study may be an indication
of decreased activity of oligodendrocytes. These ﬁndings are
further reinforced by a signiﬁcantly decreased oligodendrocyte
function pathway score (Fig. 6a).
In terms of gene expression that associated with general
immune functions and inﬂammation, only two genes were found
to be signiﬁcantly upregulated in our ﬂight mice population, H2-
T23 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398) and
SOX4
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238).
H2-T23 expression is essential for immunological protection and
regulation60. HT-T23 dependent T-cell inhibitory interactions aid in
preventing expansion of autoreactive CD4 T-cells and collateral
autoimmune diseases61. Upregulation of this gene may be a
protective response to generalized inﬂammation in the ﬂight
mice. SOX4 directly regulates Innate-like γδ T-cell (Tγδ17), a major
source of interleukin-17 (IL-17) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene/?term=NM_010552). Increased SOX4 expression may lead
to an increase of this cytokine expression in the ﬂight mice62.
The gene RIPK1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM
_009068) has been shown to be a promotor of survival, apoptotic
and inﬂammatory signaling pathways63,64. However, mice deﬁ-
cient in RIPK1 demonstrated loss of inhibition of a necroptosis
pathway which promoted the release of necroptotic damage-
associated
molecular
patterns65.
Downregulation
of
RIPK1
observed in our study may lead to a similar reduction of
appropriate apoptosis and an increase in necroptosis resulting in
undesirable
inﬂammation.
Overall,
taking
these
ﬁndings
in
conjunction with a signiﬁcantly increased cytokine signaling
pathway score (Fig. 6b), inﬂammatory signaling appears to be
signiﬁcantly dysregulated in our spaceﬂight mice.
Immune dysfunction is further illustrated via the downregulation
of two genes important for antimicrobial defense. MPEG1 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010821) is a pore-forming
bactericidal molecule of the innate immune system. It has been
shown to be required for the activity of ROS and nitric oxide and
their antibacterial effects66,67. OPTN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene/?term=NM_181848) codes for a protein that plays a key role
in bacterial autophagic clearance. Deﬁcient mice have also been

sig-
naling and reduced response to toll-like receptor stimulation68. In
summary, these results imply the impaired antibacterial capabilities
and increased viral susceptibility in the ﬂight mouse brain
compared to GC group.
Our data indicate that the regulation of innate immune
response was impaired following spaceﬂight. The pathway score
for the innate immune response was signiﬁcantly reduced in the
ﬂight group compared to GCs (Fig. 6c). The cell type score for
exhausted CD8 cells is also greatly reduced for the ﬂight group
compared to controls and may indicate a dysfunctional pheno-
type in CD8 T-cell response. T-cell exhaustion represents an
adaptive response to conditions of chronic antigen stimulation
and inﬂammation69, as well as promoting tissue repair following
an inﬂammatory injury70. Functionally exhausted CD8+ cells may
result in a severely compromised innate immune response71.
Cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene/?term=NM_024264) plays an important role in the metabolism
of cholesterol and cholesterol-related compounds72. In humans,
complete CYP27A1 deﬁciency leads to nodule formation in the brain
which may lead to dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and spinal cord
paresis73. This altered cholesterol metabolism closely associates with
inﬂammatory responses involved in the pathogenesis of AD
progression74. In deﬁcient mice, a signiﬁcant increase in cholestanol
in the brain is observed75. Downregulation of CYP27A1, as seen in
our ﬂight mice, may lead to neurodegeneration and inﬂammation in
more chronic settings or to a milder degree.
Fourteen genes that were signiﬁcantly altered in the ﬂight mice
compared to GCs were found to have direct roles in cellular growth,
proliferation, and stress response. Two upregulated genes play an
important part in cell cycle arrest during times of cellular stress.
GADD45G (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817)
has been found to play a role in activating checkpoints in the cell
cycle following exposure of cells to irradiation76. CCNG2 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635) contributes to cell
cycle arrest during DNA damage and is upregulated in response to
diverse stimuli, including hypoxia77. Additionally, expression of
CCNG2 is found to be signiﬁcantly increased in cell cycle-arrested
and terminally differentiated cells78. Upregulation of these genes
may be due to exposure to irradiation, among other stressors,
during spaceﬂight.
The downregulation of genes involved in promoting transcrip-
tion and cell cycle progression was also seen. BRD2 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010238)
codes
for
a
nuclear kinase involved in regulating the expression of cell cycle
genes via binding to multiple E2Fs, a family of transcription
factors79. E2F1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_
007891)
regulates
activation
of
DNA
replication
and
G1/S
transition when interacting with BRD280. BRD2 also interacts with
BRD3, a chromatin reader with roles in regulating transcription81.
BRD3 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113573
) further regulates transcription by promoting the binding of the
transcription
factors
to
their
targets82.
SIN3A
(https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350) codes for a
transcription factor which regulates cell cycle progression by
repressing gene expression for cell cycle inhibitor40. It has been
linked to functional cellular changes in proliferation, cell cycle, and
stem cell function in mice models83. Downregulation of these
genes involved in the promotion of cellular proliferation may
further amplify the upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle
arrest. These changes are similarly reinforced by a signiﬁcantly
increased epigenetic regulation pathway score (Fig. 6e) indicating
that there may be an increased level of modulating and checks
being implemented during transcription, due to spaceﬂight. A
recent study has shown that cell cycle regulation is closely linked
to hippocampal neurogenesis which plays critical roles in memory
and learning84. Neurogenesis is a dynamic process that involves
proliferation and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells, or
survival and maturation of newborn neurons84. Environmental
stressors have been shown to modulate cell cycle progression,
particular in the G1 phase85. These observed changes of gene
expression related to the cell cycle in our study may indicate
altered regulation of neurogenesis.
Many downregulated genes were known to be involved in
cellular stress responses. MAP2K4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene/?term=NM_009157) is a kinase involved with responses to
cellular stress including apoptosis, inﬂammation, cellular prolifera-
tion, and neurodegeneration. A deﬁciency of MAP2K4 has been
shown
to
result
in cellular
susceptibility
to stress-induced
apoptosis and growth inhibition86. However, it has been demon-
strated that disruption of both MAP2K4 and MAP2K7 (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001042557) genes was

required to thoroughly block cellular growth caused by environ-
mental stressors87. MRE11A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?
term=NM_018736), a part of an exonuclease complex central to
the cellular DNA damage response was downregulated. The MRE11
complex is essential to vertebrates and defects lead to sensitivity to
DNA damage and cell cycle checkpoints deﬁciency88. Its down-
regulation may point to a certain level of dysfunction leading to an
impaired response to cellular stress leaving the ﬂight mice more
vulnerable to DNA damage.
Different brain regions have different vulnerability to environ-
mental stressors due to structural and biological heterogeneity of the
regions, cell types and molecular networks89. Regional differences of
protein biomarkers in response to stressors were observed in a
previous ﬂight study41. Given this ﬁnding, gene expression proﬁles in
speciﬁc regions of the brain in response to spaceﬂight will be
investigated in future studies. More recently, single-cell sequencing
technologies, including transcriptomics, are available by directly
measuring multiple molecular signatures in speciﬁc brain cells,
providing robust molecular identity of speciﬁc cell types90.
Brain tissues were dissected and prepared for analysis within 60 h
after landing. It is possible that observed changes in gene expression
proﬁles in neuroinﬂammation are a compensatory acute response to
the acceleration and intense noise of launch or reﬂect changes to the
combined response of spaceﬂight environment and the landing.

In order to evaluate the immune response to spaceﬂight environ-
ment, in the further study, mice will be euthanized in the orbit and
brain tissues will be immediately preserved for analysis on the
ground. Furthermore, in order to test the hypothesis that neuroin-
ﬂammation plays an important role in developing spaceﬂight-
induced stress response in the brain, an anti-oxidant or anti-
inﬂammatory compound will be injected to mouse before or during
the ﬂight to determine the protective effect against oxidative
damage in the brain.
It is noted from our study that among those genes which
expression were signiﬁcantly altered by spaceﬂight, markedly more
gene expressions are being downregulated than upregulated. It is
speculated that many genes may be upregulated during spaceﬂight
and the early phase after landing as an adaptation response. During
re-adaptation, the expression of these previous upregulated genes
could be then downregulated as a compensatory response, or when
protein synthesis from upregulated genes has been completed,
these genes expression may be downregulated32.
Collectively, changes noted in our study indicate that exposure
to the spaceﬂight environment induces signiﬁcant changes in
gene expression and signaling pathways related to neuronal
function, immune regulation, growth and metabolic function.
Study showed that chronically dysfunctional and deregulated
pathways, including cytokine signaling (Fig. 6b), epigenetic
regulation (Fig. 6e), and notch signaling (Fig. 6f) play important
roles in disease development91, and have been associated with
several progressive neurodegenerative diseases92. Our observed
changes of a dysregulated inﬂammatory response, downregulated
T-cell response, and reduced microglia signaling (Fig. 6g) might
also have an impact on brain structure and function, and further
lead to chronic neuroinﬂammation. It has been shown that here
are strong correlations between neuroinﬂammatory biomarkers,
brain
morphology
and
behavioral
outcomes93.
It
may
be
hypothesized that chronical changes of observed gene expression
proﬁles could have long-term effects on brain morphology and
organism behavior.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Flight and ground control conditions
Ten-weeks-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Inc. Bar
Harbor, ME) at the time of launch, were ﬂown for NASA’s ninth
Rodent Research experiment (RR-9) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day
mission and
lived
in NASA’s Rodent
Habitats
aboard
the
International Space Station. All FLT mice were maintained at an
ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle
during the ﬂight. Habitat GC mice were kept under similar housing
conditions, including temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide
(CO2) levels using 48-h delayed telemetry data from the FLT
group. Water and food bar diet speciﬁcally designed by NASA
were provided ad libitum to FLT and GC groups. All mice received
the same access to food and water. NASA-Ames Research Center
and KSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees approved
this ﬂight study. The study has been done in strict accordance
with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health.
Mouse brain dissection after spaceﬂight
Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, the FLT mice were rapidly
euthanized in 100% CO2. The GC mice were euthanized with the
same method after 38 days of GC housing. Shortly after
euthanasia, brains were removed and bisected along the midline
and coronally within the half hemispheres. The right caudal half
hemisphere of the brain (containing mid- and hindbrain) from
each mouse (n = 5–6 per group) was placed in a sterile cryovial,
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C prior to use.
RNA isolation and gene expression proﬁling
Isolation of total RNA from the brain tissues was performed using
DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, # 80224) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Brieﬂy, tissue homogenization was
performed using 1.5 mm beads (Benchmark, # 1032-15) on Minilys
homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) in RLT Plus buffer. The purity and
concentration of the eluted RNA were measured using Nanodrop
2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA) and stored at −80 °C
until further analysis. RNA samples (20 ng/ul) were then shipped to
Nanostring (Technologies Seattle, WA) and gene expression proﬁling
of brain tissues was conducted using the nCounter® neuroﬂamma-
tion pathways panel. The panel includes 757 genes covering the
core pathways and processes that deﬁne neuroimmune interactions
and 13 potential housekeeping genes for normalization. RNA
samples (100 ng each) on 2 cartridges were used for the Gene
Expression Assay with Mouse Neuroinﬂammation panel performed
on the nCounter MAX system (https://nanostring.com/wp-content/
uploads/MAN-C0035_nCounter_Analysis_System_MAX_FLEX.pdf), a
multi-channel epiﬂuorescence scanner with Nanostring Advanced
Analysis Module plugin for QC, normalization, and differential
expression analysis (DE). Data ﬁles generated from nCounter system
were analyzed using nSolver 4.0 software with the Advanced
Analysis module for QC (quality control), normalization, DE analysis,
and gene-set enrichment analysis. Data normalization included
2 steps: Positive control normalization to correct platform-associated
variation and Codeset content normalization using the house-
keeping (HK) genes to correct variability of input samples. Geometric
means of selected HK probes were used to normalize counts of the
samples and DEGs were generated from the normalized counts.
Statistical analysis
Gene expression proﬁling data were analyzed using nSolver
analysis and the advanced analysis module software. Advanced
analysis module software uses open-source R program for
pathway scoring and gene-set enrichment analysis. Using the
Reactome pathway database annotations, pathway scores are
derived by calculating the ﬁrst principle component of pathway
genes’ normalized expression86 and data are summarized from
changes of a gene set within a given pathway into a single score.
To further analyze the associated pathways of the DEGs, Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis
was performed using biological process database to identify the
annotated sets of genes based on the biological processes in
which they participate. Signiﬁcantly differential expression genes
were presented in the tables with individual genes using log10
(p value) andlog2 fold change compared to the GC group.
Pathview module was used to display upregulated genes or
downregulated genes overlaid on KEGG pathways. For DEG and
pathway analysis, p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant
between FLT and GC groups by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s
HSD test.
