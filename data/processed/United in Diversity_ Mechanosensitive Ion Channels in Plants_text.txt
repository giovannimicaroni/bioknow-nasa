Abstract Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from
innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A
mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of
mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-
phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception.
Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly
impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to
innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A
mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant
mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of
KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and
establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.

Introduction
Pain is a complex sensation. It serves to protect organisms from harmful stimuli, but can also become
chronic and debilitating following tissue injury and disease. Distinct cells and molecules detect nox-
ious thermal and mechanical stimuli. Thermal pain is detected by thermosensitive TRP channels in
subsets of nociceptors (Caterina et al., 2000; Vriens et al., 2011), and gentle touch is detected by
Piezo2 channels in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) (Ranade et al., 2014; Woo et al.,
2014). Ad high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) have been shown to play a key role in
responses to painful mechanical stimuli (Arcourt et al., 2017; Ghitani et al., 2017).
Recent studies have shown that there are at least two populations of HTMRs that mediate
responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. The Npy2r+ subpopulation of HTMRs mediates fast paw
withdrawal responses to pinprick stimulation and terminates as free nerve endings in the epidermis
(Arcourt et al., 2017). The Calca+ subpopulation of circumferential-HTMRs responds to noxious
force and hair pulling, and terminates as circumferential endings wrapped around guard hair follicles
(Ghitani et al., 2017). Additionally, somatostatin-expressing interneurons of laminae I-III in the dor-
sal horn of the spinal cord receive input from nociceptors and are required for behavioral responses

to painful mechanical stimuli (Duan et al., 2014). Despite these advances in defining the cells and
circuits
of
mechanical
pain,
little
is
known
about
the
molecular
signaling
pathways
in
mechanonociceptors.
Here, we show that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is required for mechanical pain sensation. S1P
is a bioactive lipid that signals via 5 G-protein coupled S1P Receptors (S1PRs 1–5). S1P signaling,
mainly via S1PR1, plays a well-known role in immune cell migration and maturation (Spiegel and Mil-
stien, 2003; Matloubian et al., 2004; Schwab et al., 2005). Additionally, recent studies have shown
that S1PRs are expressed throughout the nervous system (Janes et al., 2014; Mair et al., 2011;
Camprubı´-Robles et al., 2013) and S1P signaling is associated with a variety of neuroinflammatory
disorders,
including
multiple
sclerosis
(Brinkmann
et
al.,
2010)
and
Alzheimer’s
disease
(Couttas et al., 2014). S1P has been implicated in spontaneous pain (Camprubı´-Robles et al.,
2013) and thermal pain hypersensitivity (Mair et al., 2011; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015),
but due to conflicting accounts of S1P receptor expression in the CNS (Janes et al., 2014; Weth-
Malsch et al., 2016) and PNS (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubı´-Robles et al., 2013; Usoskin et al.,
2015) as well as inconsistent reports on the effects of S1P on neuronal excitability (Camprubı´-
Robles et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015) and pain behaviors (Mair et al., 2011; Cam-
prubı´-Robles et al., 2013; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015), the role of S1P in somatosensa-
tion remains controversial.
We found that mice lacking the S1P receptor S1PR3 display striking and selective deficits in
behavioral responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Likewise, peripheral blockade of S1PR3 signal-
ing or S1P production impairs mechanical sensitivity. We show that S1P constitutively enhances the
excitability of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) via closure of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels to tune
mechanical pain sensitivity. The effects of S1P are completely dependent on S1PR3. While previous
studies have shown that elevated S1P triggers acute pain and injury-evoked thermal sensitization
(Mair et al., 2011; Camprubı´-Robles et al., 2013), we now demonstrate that baseline levels of S1P
are necessary and sufficient for setting normal mechanical pain thresholds. By contrast, elevated S1P
selectively triggers thermal sensitization via activation of TRPV1+ heat nociceptors, with no effect on
mechanical hypersensitivity. Our findings uncover an essential role for constitutive S1P signaling in
mechanical pain.
Results
To identify candidate genes underlying mechanosensation, we previously performed transcriptome
analysis of the sensory ganglia innervating the ultra-sensitive tactile organ (the star) of the star-nosed
mole (Gerhold et al., 2013). Immunostaining revealed the tactile organ is preferentially innervated
by myelinated Ad fibers (Gerhold et al., 2013), which are primarily mechanosensitive. While our
original analysis focused on ion channels enriched in the neurons of the star organ, our dataset also
revealed enrichment of several components of the S1P pathway, including S1pr3. Likewise, single-
cell RNA seq of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed S1pr3 expression in a subset of
myelinated mechanoreceptors (Usoskin et al., 2015) in addition to a subpopulation of peptidergic
C nociceptors.
S1P promotes excitability in small-diameter, capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors (Mair et al., 2011;
Camprubı´-Robles et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015). In addition, S1PR3 has been
shown to mediate spontaneous pain triggered by elevated S1P and thermal sensitization following
sterile tissue injury (Camprubı´-Robles et al., 2013). However, no studies have examined the role of
S1PR3 in mechanosensation or in regulating somatosensory behaviors under normal conditions.
Given the enrichment of S1pr3 in mechanosensory neurons of the star-nosed mole and mouse, we
hypothesized that S1P signaling via S1PR3 may also play a role in mechanosensation. Thus, we set
out to define the role of S1P signaling and S1PR3 in somatosensory mechanoreceptors.
S1PR3 mediates acute mechanical pain
We first examined a variety of somatosensory behaviors in mice lacking S1PR3 (Kono et al., 2004)
(S1pr3tm1Rlp/Mmnc; referred to herein as S1PR3 KO). We initially investigated baseline responses to
mechanical stimuli. S1PR3 KO mice displayed a dramatic loss of mechanical sensitivity (Figure 1A;
see Figure 1—source data 1), as von Frey paw withdrawal thresholds were significantly elevated in
S1PR3 KO mice relative to WT and S1PR3 HET littermates (mean thresholds: 1.737 g vs. 0.736 and

0.610 g, respectively). Moreover, S1PR3 KO mice demonstrated decreased responses to a range of
noxious tactile stimuli (2–6 g; Figure 1B) and to noxious pinprick stimulation (Figure 1C), but normal
responsiveness to innocuous tactile stimuli (0.6–1.4 g; Figure 1B). S1PR3 KO mice exhibited normal
tape removal attempts (Ranade et al., 2014) (Figure 1D), righting reflexes (Figure 1—figure

supplement 1A), radiant heat withdrawal latencies (Figure 1E), and itch-evoked scratching (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1B). These results demonstrate a selective role for S1PR3 in acute
mechanical pain.
As a complement to our analysis of somatosensation in S1PR3 KO animals, we employed a phar-
macological approach, using the S1PR3-selective antagonist TY 52156 (TY) (Nussbaum et al., 2015).
Similar to the phenotype of knockout animals, intradermal injection of 500 mM TY into the mouse
hindpaw (the site of testing) triggered a rapid and significant elevation in von Frey paw withdrawal
thresholds (Figure 1F) and decreased responsiveness to noxious (2–6 g), but not innocuous (0.6–1.4
g), tactile stimuli (Figure 1G), without affecting noxious heat sensitivity (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1C). By contrast, blockade of S1PR1 with the selective antagonist W146 (Finley et al., 2013)
had no effect on baseline mechanical or thermal thresholds (Figure 1F; Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1C). Overall, these data show that S1PR3 signaling sets mechanical pain sensitivity.
Endogenous S1P mediates acute mechanical pain
We next asked whether peripheral S1P was required for the S1PR3-dependent effects on mechano-
sensation. We decreased S1P levels via injection of the sphingosine kinase inhibitor SKI II to block
local production of S1P (Chiba et al., 2010) or elevated S1P levels via intradermal injection of S1P
and measured behaviors 30 min after injection. Decreasing local S1P levels with SKI II significantly
reduced mechanical sensitivity (Figure 2A; see Figure 2—source data 1), comparable to the hypo-
sensitivity phenotype observed in S1PR3 KO mice (Figure 1A). Again, similar to what was observed
in S1PR3 KO animals (Figure 1E), peripheral blockade of S1P production had no effect on baseline
thermal sensitivity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Surprisingly, injecting exogenous S1P (10 mM;
maximum solubility in saline vehicle) had no effect on mechanical sensitivity (Figure 2A–B). However,
as previously reported (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubı´-Robles et al., 2013), S1P injection triggered
S1PR3-dependent thermal hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain (Figure 2C–D), demonstrating that
the lack of effect on mechanical hypersensitivity is not due to problems with S1P delivery or
degradation.
These data support a model whereby S1P constitutively activates S1PR3 to set normal mechanical
pain thresholds. To further test this model, we asked if the mechanical hyposensitivity elicited after
endogenous S1P depletion (via SKI II) could be rescued by local injection of exogenous S1P. Indeed,
we found that injection of exogenous S1P reversed SKI II-induced mechanical hyposensitivity in a
dose-dependent manner, and observed a maximal effect with 200 nM S1P (Figure 2E). Although
quantification of native S1P levels in skin is inaccurate owing to avid lyase activity (Shaner et al.,
2009), our data establish that baseline S1P levels are sufficient to maximally exert their effect on
S1PR3-dependent mechanical pain, such that increased S1P does not evoke mechanical hypersensi-
tivity, but diminished S1P leads to mechanical hyposensitivity. These data show that constitutive acti-
vation of S1PR3 by S1P is required for normal mechanosensitivity.
S1PR3 is expressed in A mechanonociceptors and thermal nociceptors
Our behavioral data showing distinct roles for S1PR3 in mechanonociception and thermal hypersen-
sitivity suggest that S1PR3 is expressed in distinct subsets of somatosensory neurons. While a previ-
ous study suggested that all somatosensory neurons express S1PR3 (Camprubı´-Robles et al., 2013),
single cell RNA seq data suggests S1pr3 is not expressed by all DRG neurons (Usoskin et al., 2015),
and no studies have performed quantitative analysis of S1PR3 staining or co-staining to define sub-
populations of S1PR3+ neurons. We thus set out to characterize the somatosensory neuron subtypes
expressing S1pr3 using in situ hybridization (ISH) of wild-type somatosensory ganglia and immuno-
histochemistry (IHC) in an S1pr3mCherry/+ reporter mouse (Sanna et al., 2016).
We first used in situ hybridization (ISH) with a specific S1pr3 probe to examine expression pat-
terns of S1pr3 (Figure 3A–B; see Supplementary file 1). In our experiments, 43% of cells from wild-
type DRG expressed S1pr3. Co-ISH revealed that one population of S1pr3+ neurons represents Ad
mechanonociceptors (AMs). These cells expressed Scn1a (39.9% of all S1pr3+), a gene that encodes
the Nav1.1 sodium channel, which mediates mechanical pain in Ad fibers (Osteen et al., 2016).
S1pr3+ cells also co-expressed Npy2r (20.4% of all S1pr3+), a marker of a subset of mechanonoci-
ceptive A fibers (Arcourt et al., 2017). S1pr3 was expressed in 70.6% of Scn1a+ cells and 72% of
Npy2r+ cells, comprising a majority of both of these populations. Interestingly, a subset of cells co-

expressed S1pr3 and the mechanically sensitive channel Piezo2, which is expressed by Ab, Ad, and C
fibers (Ranade et al., 2014). The remaining S1pr3+ cells were Trpv1+ and/or Trpa1+ C nociceptors
(67.1% of all S1pr3+), which are reported to overlap minimally with the Scn1a+ and Npy2r+ popula-
tions (Arcourt et al., 2017; Osteen et al., 2016).
We next used an S1pr3mCherry/+ reporter mouse, which produces a functional S1PR3-mCherry
fusion protein (Sanna et al., 2016), as an independent strategy to explore S1PR3 expression and
localization. This strategy was used because we found that anti-S1PR3 antibodies showed broad
immunoreactivity in DRG from mice lacking S1PR3, and so we instead used anti-DsRed antibodies to
probe expression of the S1PR3 fusion protein (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). We found that
42.4% of S1PR3+ cells co-stained with anti-Peripherin, demonstrating that S1PR3 is expressed in a
subset of small-diameter neurons. We also observed that 69.5% of S1PR3+ cells co-stained with anti-
NF200, which marks medium and large-diameter myelinated neurons. Furthermore, we observed
that S1PR3+ cells were primarily of small to medium diameter (11.3–35.1 mm), whereas all cells in the
DRG ranged from 11.3 to 53.9 mm. Overall, these data support the expression of S1PR3 in subsets
of small-diameter thermal nociceptors and medium-diameter mechanonociceptors (Figure 3F).
Additionally, no significant differences were observed between WT and S1PR3 KO DRG in number
of Trpa1+, Trpv1+, Peripherin+, NF200+, or IB4+ cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C,F,G). The
mean diameters of Trpv1+ neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, left), NF200+ neurons (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1G), or all neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, right) in WT versus
KO DRG were not significantly different, suggesting no loss of major sensory neuronal subtypes in
the S1PR3 KO.
We then visualized S1PR3 expression in nerve fibers that innervate the skin using anti-DsRed anti-
bodies in whole-mount immunohistochemistry (IHC; Figure 3D). The reporter animals showed no
specific antibody staining in epidermal or dermal cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1I), and single-
cell RNA seq of a diverse array of mouse epidermal and dermal cells corroborates this lack of
expression (Joost et al., 2016). We observed overlap of S1PR3-expressing free nerve endings with
NF200+ myelinated free nerves and NF200- putative C-fiber endings (Figure 3F), but did not
observe expression of S1PR3 in NF200+ circumferential or lanceolate hair follicle receptors, or in
putative Merkel afferents (Figure 3D–E). b-tubulin III, PGP9.5 (pan-neuronal markers), and NF200
staining in S1PR3 KO skin displayed patterns of epidermal and dermal innervation similar to WT skin,
suggesting the phenotypes observed in the S1PR3 KO mice are not due to developmental loss of
sensory neuronal innervation (pPGP9.5= 0.443 (n = 93, 38 fibers); pNefH = 0.405 (n = 61, 28 fibers);
pBTIII = 0.353 (n = 104, 89 fibers); two-tailed t-tests based on average number of fibers per field of
view). These results support expression of S1PR3 in subsets of myelinated A mechanonociceptors
and unmyelinated C nociceptors that terminate as free nerve endings.
S1P activates thermal nociceptors but not putative AMs
Live imaging of cultured DRG neurons from adult reporter animals showed expression of S1PR3-
mCherry fusion protein in 48.3% of neurons, mirroring our ISH and IHC results (Figure 4A). To exam-
ine the effects of S1P on A mechanonociceptors and C nociceptors, we performed ratiometric cal-
cium imaging and electrophysiology on DRG cultures from reporter mice. Interestingly, only 56.1 ±
22.4% of mCherry-expressing neurons were activated by 1 mM S1P (Representative trace in
Figure 4B; representative images in Figure 4C), which our dose-response showed to be the saturat-
ing concentration for calcium influx (Figure 4D; EC50 = 155 nM). All S1P-responsive neurons were
also capsaicin-sensitive (n > 2000 neurons). And while sensory neurons from S1PR3 KO animals did
not respond to S1P, as expected (Camprubı´-Robles et al., 2013), they exhibited capsaicin responses

that were not significantly different from WT neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H). The mean
diameter of S1P-responsive mCherry+ neurons was 22.4 ± 1.0 mm, whereas the mean diameter of
non-responsive mCherry+ neurons was 28.7 ± 3.2 mm (p=0.0002, two-tailed t-test). We also per-
formed whole cell current clamp experiments and, consistent with other studies (Mair et al., 2011;
Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015), found that S1P evoked action potential firing in capsaicin-sensi-
tive small diameter cells (Figure 4E). This shows that only the small-diameter, S1PR3+ putative noci-
ceptors are excited by S1P. We next asked whether the S1PR3+ medium-large diameter neurons
represent the mechanonociceptors observed by ISH (Figure 3A). To this end, we asked whether the
spider toxin Hm1a, a selective activator of AM nociceptors (Osteen et al., 2016), triggers calcium
influx in S1PR3-expressing trigeminal neurons. Indeed, we found that 44.2 ± 15.1% of Hm1a-respon-
sive neurons expressed mCherry (Figure 4F), consistent with our staining showing expression of
S1pr3 in AM nociceptors and the role of Hm1a-responsive neurons in mediating mechanical pain in
vivo (Osteen et al., 2016).
S1PR3 modulates KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate AM excitability
We next interrogated the molecular mechanism by which S1P signaling in AM nociceptors may regu-
late
mechanical
pain.
We
performed
whole-cell
current
clamp
on
the
medium-diameter
S1pr3mCherry/+ dissociated DRG neurons (membrane capacitance = 61.05 ± 1.92 pF), which did not
display S1P-evoked calcium influx (Figure 4B–C). In these cells, 1 mM S1P application did not change
membrane potential (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; see Figure 5—source data 1) or elicit firing
in the absence of current injection (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; Figure 5A). However, S1P
dramatically lowered the threshold to fire action potentials (rheobase) in an S1PR3-dependent man-
ner (Figure 5A, Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).
We then set out to determine the mechanism by which S1PR3 activity increases neuronal excit-
ability using whole-cell voltage clamp recording. Previous studies showed that S1P excites capsaicin-
sensitive nociceptors by increasing voltage-gated sodium currents and reducing steady-state potas-
sium currents (Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015). We found that S1P had no such effects on
S1PR3+ medium-diameter cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E). By contrast, S1P triggered a
robust increase in input resistance (Figure 5B), consistent with the closure of potassium channels. I-V
analysis revealed that the current inhibited by S1P application was carried by potassium (Figure 5C).
Additionally, S1P significantly reduced slow, voltage-dependent tail current amplitudes (Figure 5—
figure supplement 1F; Figure 5D (top)) in an S1PR3-dependent manner (Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 1F, center).
As tail currents in Ad neurons are primarily mediated by KCNQ2/3 potassium channels
(Schu¨tze et al., 2016; Passmore et al., 2012), we postulated that S1P may alter tail currents
through modulation of these channels. Furthermore, the above properties of the S1P-sensitive cur-

channels mediated S1P-dependent neuronal excitability, we applied the KCNQ2/3-selective inhibitor

results were observed with the related antagonist, linopirdine (Figure 5D). These findings are consis-
tent with S1P/S1PR3-dependent inhibition of KCNQ2/3 in somatosensory neurons.
We also found that the effect of S1P on KCNQ2/3 currents was mediated by low levels of S1P,
exhibiting an IC50 of 48 nM with saturation at 100 nM (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G). While S1P
cannot be accurately measured in non-plasma tissues, this is similar to estimated levels of S1P in
peripheral tissues (Schwab et al., 2005; Ramos-Perez et al., 2015), and to levels which rescued
mechanosensitivity after local S1P depletion (Figure 2E). Thus, our in vitro IC50 supports our finding
that baseline S1P levels are sufficient to maximally exert their effect on mechanical pain. In summary,
our electrophysiological and behavioral observations support a model in which baseline S1P/S1PR3
signaling governs mechanical pain thresholds through modulation of KCNQ2/3 channel activity in
AM neurons.
S1PR3 is required for nociceptive responses of high-threshold AM
nociceptors
Given the effects of S1P on putative AM neurons in vitro and the selective attenuation of baseline
mechanical pain in S1PR3 KO animals, we hypothesized that S1PR3 would play a role in AM afferent
function. To test this, we utilized ex vivo skin-nerve recordings to analyze the effects of genetic abla-
tion of S1PR3 on AM afferents, which mediate fast mechanical pain sensation. S1PR3 HET animals
were used as littermate controls because no significant differences were observed between S1PR3
WT and S1PR3 HET mice in any behavioral assay (Figure 1), and because force-response relation-
ships are comparable between S1PR3 HET AM fibers and wild type AM recordings (Osteen et al.,
2016; McIlwrath et al., 2007; Kwan et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2013; Garrison et al., 2012) (Fig-
ure 6—figure supplement 1A; see Figure 6—source data 1). Compared to S1PR3 HET, S1PR3 KO
AM nociceptors displayed reduced sensitivity in their force-response relation (slope for HET versus
KO: 50 Hz/N versus 35 Hz/N), as well as attenuated firing over the noxious, but not innocuous, range
of mechanical stimulation (Figure 6A). Strikingly, the median von Frey threshold to elicit firing in AM
nociceptors was significantly higher in S1PR3 KO animals (3.92 mN) compared to littermate controls
(1.56 mN; Figure 6B). Furthermore, S1PR3 KO AM nociceptors displayed a right-shifted cumulative
response curve to force-controlled stimuli (50% effective force for HET versus KO: 33.7 versus 60.0
mN; Figure 6C), consistent with the mechanonociceptive hyposensitivity observed in vivo. By con-
trast, neither AM conduction velocities nor the conduction velocity distributions of Ab, Ad, and C
fibers differed between genotypes (Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B).
A recent study reported that A-nociceptors are composed of two genetically distinct neuronal
populations that differ in conduction velocity and in adaptation properties (Arcourt et al., 2017)
(‘Adapting AM’ versus ‘Non-adapting AM’). We next asked whether loss of S1PR3 signaling altered
these AM subtypes. Adapting AM fibers responded more vigorously to dynamic (ramp) stimuli than
to static (hold) stimuli, and displayed a mean dynamic firing frequency at least twofold greater than
their static firing frequency (Arcourt et al., 2017) (Figure 6E, upper traces). By contrast, Non-adapt-
ing AM fibers often showed bursting during static stimulation, which resulted in similar firing rates
during dynamic and static stimulation (Figure 6E, lower traces). S1PR3 KO animals displayed a sig-
nificantly lower proportion of Adapting AM nociceptors compared with littermate controls
(Figure 6F). Additionally, we observed an increase in S1PR3 KO AM fibers that were unresponsive
to controlled force stimulation (Figure 6F). These ‘non-responders’ only fired action potentials to
high-pressure stimuli with a blunt glass probe or to suprathreshold stimulation with von Frey fila-
ments (see Methods). The Non-adapting AMs, and the few remaining mechanosensitive Adapting
AMs in the S1PR3 KO displayed similar firing frequencies over both the dynamic and static phases of
force application to control fibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). This suggests that decreased

mechanosensitivity of the Adapting AM population accounts for the significant reduction in force-fir-
ing relations observed at the population level in S1PR3 KO AMs (Figure 6A). We conclude that
S1PR3 is an essential regulator of both mechanical threshold and sensitivity in a distinct population
of AM nociceptors.
S1PR3 is required for inflammatory pain hypersensitivity
Having examined the mechanisms of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in acute mechanonociception, we next
sought to evaluate S1P/S1PR3 signaling in pain hypersensitivity. For this purpose, we used an experi-
mental model of inflammatory pain triggered by Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) injection into
the hindpaw, which elicits infiltration of immune cells and thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity
(Ghasemlou et al., 2015). While one previous study proposed that S1PR3 promotes injury-evoked
heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, they did not measure or compare post-injury mechanical
thresholds to pre-injury baselines for the knockout or control animals (Camprubı´-Robles et al.,
2013). Here, we compared development of CFA-evoked hypersensitivity between S1PR3 HET and
KO littermates, since no significant behavioral differences were observed between WT and HET ani-
mals in CFA experiments (pvon Frey = 0.12; pradiant heat = 0.12; two-tailed t-tests). Strikingly, S1PR3
KO mice failed to develop thermal hypersensitivity (Figure 7A; see Figure 7—source data 1) rela-
tive to heterozygous littermates at both 24 and 48 hr post-CFA injection. In stark contrast, S1PR3
KO animals developed robust mechanical hypersensitivity when thresholds were normalized to
account for the dramatic baseline differences between knockouts and control animals (Figure 7B).
Our data demonstrate that S1PR3 mediates baseline mechanical sensitivity and is not required for
the development of CFA-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity.
Influx of myeloid lineage (Cd11b+/Ly6G-) cells is required for the development of mechanical
hypersensitivity in the CFA model (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). In the immune system, S1P signaling
via S1PR1 plays a key role in immune cell migration (Matloubian et al., 2004). Consistent with the
development of mechanical hypersensitivity, flow cytometry experiments showed robust infiltration
of immune cells into hindpaw skin from both S1PR3 KO and littermate controls (Figure 7—figure
supplement 1A–B). These data suggest that the phenotypes observed in S1PR3 KO mice cannot be
attributed to compromised immune cell infiltration.
Next, we tested whether active S1P/S1PR3 signaling was required to maintain CFA-evoked ther-
mal hypersensitivity using pharmacology. Acute blockade of S1P production with SKI II or S1PR3
with TY also reversed CFA heat hypersensitivity (Figure 7C), demonstrating that peripheral S1P
actively signals via S1PR3 to promote CFA-evoked heat hypersensitivity. Furthermore, acute S1P/
S1PR3 blockade with SKI II or TY elevated mechanical thresholds to pre-CFA, baseline levels
(Figure 7D) showing that S1PR3 tunes mechanical pain under normal and inflammatory conditions.
These results are consistent with the distinct roles for AM and C nociceptors in mechanical pain.
Under normal conditions, AM nociceptors set mechanical pain thresholds (Osteen et al., 2016;
Abrahamsen et al., 2008). By contrast, under inflammatory conditions, the combined activity of
both non-sensitized AM fibers and sensitized C fibers determines overall post-inflammatory

mechanical thresholds (Lennertz et al., 2012; Abrahamsen et al., 2008). Consistent with this
model, acute blockade of S1P production or S1PR3 activity under normal conditions induces
mechanical hyposensitivity and under inflammatory conditions returns mechanical sensitivity to nor-
mal levels.
Discussion
We now show that S1P signaling via S1PR3 is a key pathway that tunes mechanical pain sensitivity.
Overall, our data reveal two new key findings. First, S1P/S1PR3 sets baseline mechanical pain thresh-
olds. Depletion of baseline, endogenous S1P induces mechanical hyposensitivity and nanomolar lev-
els of exogenous S1P are sufficient to restore normal mechanical pain sensitivity after depletion.
Second, elevated micromolar S1P levels, such as those produced during inflammation or disease,
promote thermal, but not mechanical hypersensitivity. The effects of S1P on acute mechanical pain
and thermal hypersensitivity are completely lost in S1PR3 knockout animals, which are otherwise nor-
mal with respect to other somatosensory behaviors.
What is the local source of S1P in the skin that constitutively modulates mechanical pain? Even in
the mature field of S1P signaling in the vascular and immune systems, the cellular source of S1P,
while an intriguing question, remains unclear. All cells in the body, including somatosensory neurons,
immune cells, and skin cells, express sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 which are essential for S1P produc-
tion (Chalfant and Spiegel, 2005). Deletion of both kinases is lethal and attempts to conditionally
knockout these kinases fail to completely eliminate S1P in tissues (Pappu et al., 2007). While RNA
seq data suggests that somatosensory neurons contain all of the enzymatic machinery required to
produce and export local S1P (Usoskin et al., 2015; Morita et al., 2015), future work will be
needed to identify the key cell types that are important for maintaining baseline S1P levels in the
skin to regulate mechanical sensitivity and for increasing S1P under inflammatory/injury conditions to
promote pain hypersensitivity.
Recent studies have identified distinct populations of AM nociceptors that are required for
mechanical pain (Arcourt et al., 2017; Ghitani et al., 2017). Likewise, it was discovered that a sub-
set of somatostatin-expressing spinal interneurons is required for mechanical pain transduction
(Duan et al., 2014). Although these papers delineate the cells and circuitry of mechanical pain, the
molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception in the periphery are poorly understood. While the
identity of the transduction channel(s) in AM nociceptors remains enigmatic, understanding molecu-
lar mechanisms that regulate excitability will no doubt provide key insights into the function and spe-
cialization of the diverse subtypes of mechanosensitive nerve fibers. For example, although Piezo2-
hypomorphic animals exhibit normal mechanical pain behaviors (Ranade et al., 2014), ex vivo skin-
nerve

that

decreased
force-responsiveness
(Ranade et al., 2014), and a recent study found that subpopulations of sensory neurons express dif-
ferent splice variants of Piezo2 that exhibit different force sensitivities (Szczot et al., 2017). These
studies suggest that mechanosensitive neurons exhibit functional specialization on multiple levels.
Our study demonstrates that S1PR3 is indispensable for normal function of AM nociceptors, includ-
ing the adapting AM population, recently discussed in Arcourt et al., that innervates the epidermis
and encodes noxious touch (Arcourt et al., 2017). We show that S1PR3 signaling modulates
KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate excitability of these A mechanonociceptors (Figure 8).
GPCR-mediated inhibition of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels is a well-known mechanism by which
neuronal excitability is regulated (Passmore et al., 2003). Other studies have shown that KCNQ
channels mediate excitability of Ad fibers (Schu¨tze et al., 2016; Passmore et al., 2012) and are
required for normal mechanonociceptive responses in dorsal horn neurons receiving Ad input
(Passmore et al., 2012), and that opening KCNQ2/3 channels directly with retigabine alleviates pain
in vivo (Xu et al., 2010; Hayashi et al., 2014; Blackburn-Munro and Jensen, 2003). Our results not
only complement previous work implicating KCNQ2/3 channels in pain, but also define the upstream
mechanisms that promote the regulation of KCNQ2/3 channels to tune mechanical pain thresholds.

Our data thus highlight S1PR3 as a novel and attractive target for the treatment of mechanical pain
and describe a new signaling pathway regulating AM nociceptor excitability.
Interestingly, the neurons that innervate the ultra-sensitive tactile organ of the star-nosed mole are
highly enriched in transcripts for S1PR3 and KCNQ channels, as well as for a variety of other potassium
channels (Gerhold et al., 2013). While it is difficult to directly examine the physiological basis for
heightened mechanosensitivity in the star-nosed mole, S1PR3-dependent modulation of KCNQ may
represent an important mechanism underlying the high tactile sensitivity of the star organ.
Moreover, the link between S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 is echoed in single-cell RNA seq datasets from mouse
DRG neurons, which show co-expression of S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 in a subset of myelinated mechanore-
ceptors (Usoskin et al., 2015). These cells are distinct from the S1pr3/Trpv1 subset that mediates
S1P-evoked acute pain and heat hypersensitivity. In addition to being transcriptionally distinct, we
show that the mechanisms underlying S1P’s activities in these cells are functionally distinct. Finally,
S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 are highly expressed in human sensory ganglia (Ray et al., 2018; Flegel et al.,
2015) and recordings from human stem cell-derived sensory neurons show that KCNQ2/3 channels
play a key role in mediating their excitability (Young et al., 2014). Thus S1PR3 signaling may represent
a new target for modulating mechanical pain.
Previous studies of S1P signaling in DRG neurons focused on S1P-evoked excitation of small diame-
ter and/or capsaicin-sensitive neurons, and pain behaviors triggered by elevated S1P. While our new

data affirms the effects S1P in thermal nociceptors observed by others, our manuscript highlights a
novel effect of baseline levels of S1P in modulation of rheobase and KCNQ2/3 currents in mechanono-
ciceptors. We are also the first to examine the role of S1PR3 in a variety of somatosensory behaviors
under normal conditions (non-injury, no algogen injection), and to demonstrate a key role for S1PR3 in
mechanonociception. We also go beyond previous studies (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubı´-
Robles et al., 2013; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015) in showing that elevated S1P selectively
promotes thermal and not mechanical hypersensitivity. Others have shown that there are distinct cells
and molecular pathways that trigger thermal versus mechanical hypersensitivity. For example, thermal
hypersensitivity in the CFA model is dependent on TRPV1 ion channels (Caterina et al., 2000) and
independent of immune cell infiltration (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). By contrast, infiltration of a subset
of myeloid immune cells is required for mechanical hypersensitivity in an inflammatory pain model
(Ghasemlou et al., 2015). Here we show that S1P via S1PR3 signaling is a key component of the
inflammatory soup that triggers thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA model. Our observation that
S1PR3 KO animals display normal immune cell infiltration and develop mechanical hypersensitivity
after CFA is consistent with these previous studies showing distinct mechanisms of inflammatory ther-
mal and mechanical hypersensitivity.
Outside of the nervous system, S1P signaling via S1PR1 allows for the continuous circulation of lym-
phocytes between blood, lymph, and peripheral tissues (Matloubian et al., 2004). Our findings that
S1P plays a key role in noxious mechanosensation are in line with recent studies showing that sensory
neurons co-opt classical immune pathways to drive chronic itch or pain (Oetjen et al., 2017; Pinho-
Ribeiro et al., 2017). What distinguishes this study from the others is that S1P signaling is critical for
acute mechanical pain, even in the absence of inflammation or exogenously elevated S1P. In the
immune system, disruptions in S1P levels or S1PR1 signaling result in significant immune dysfunction
and disease (Donoviel et al., 2015; Gra¨ler and Goetzl, 2004; Olivera et al., 2013). Accordingly, in
the somatosensory system, excessive, high levels of S1P (micromolar), such as those present in inflam-
mation, evokes thermal pain and sensitization. Intermediate, baseline levels (nanomolar) regulate AM
excitability and are required for normal mechanical pain sensation. By contrast, lowering S1P levels
reduces mechanical pain sensation, while sparing innocuous touch sensation.
We propose that S1PR3 signaling may contribute to a variety of inflammatory diseases. S1P has
been linked to a wide range of human inflammatory disorders (Allende et al., 2011; Kunkel et al.,
2013; Roviezzo et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2013; Rivera et al., 2008; Mys´liwiec et al., 2017;
Checa et al., 2015). Canonically, S1P signaling via S1PR1 is thought to promote inflammation via the
immune system (Kunkel et al., 2013), however, we propose that S1P signaling via S1PR3 in neurons
may also contribute to inflammatory disease. Indeed, fingolimod, a non-selective S1PR modulator, is
prescribed as an immunosuppressant for multiple sclerosis treatment (Brinkmann et al., 2010), but
the possibility that some of its therapeutic effects may also be mediated via the nervous system has
not been fully explored. Likewise, one study found that intrathecal fingolimod reduces bone cancer
pain (Grenald et al., 2017), and while analgesia was attributed to effects on S1PR1 in glia, some of the
benefits may be due to S1PR3 signaling in DRG neurons. S1PR3 antagonism may also be useful in the
treatment of inflammatory pain due to its selective dampening of acute mechanical pain and inflamma-
tory thermal hypersensitivity, while preserving innocuous touch and normal thermal sensitivity. S1PR3
inhibitors may also be beneficial for treating other inflammatory disorders where S1PR3-expressing
somatosensory neurons have been shown to contribute to neurogenic inflammation, such as asthma
(Tra¨nkner et al., 2014). Our study demonstrates a crucial role for S1P signaling in the peripheral ner-
vous system and highlights the potential of S1PR3 as a target for future pain therapies.

Behavioral studies and mice
S1pr3mcherry/+ and S1pr3-/- mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and backcrossed to
C57bl6/J. Wherever possible, wild-type/heterozygous (S1pr3) littermate controls were used in
behavioral experiments. Mice (20–25 g) were housed in 12 hr light-dark cycle at 21˚C. Mice were sin-
gly housed one week prior to all behavioral experiments and were between 8–10 weeks at the time
of the experiment. All mice were acclimated in behavioral chambers (IITC Life Sciences) on two sub-
sequent days for 1 hr prior to all behavioral experiments.
Itch
and
acute
pain
behavioral
measurements
were
performed
as
previously
described
(Morita et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2013; Tsunozaki et al., 2013). Mice were shaved one week prior
to itch behavior. Compounds injected: 500 mM TY 52156 (Tocris), 50 mM SKI II (Tocris), 0.2–10 mM
S1P (Tocris, Avanti Polar Lipids), 50 mM chloroquine (Sigma), and 27 mM histamine (Tocris) in PBS
with either 0.01–0.1% Methanol- (S1P) or 0.1–0.5% DMSO-PBS (all other compounds) vehicle con-
trols. Pruritogens were injected using the cheek model (20 mL) of itch, as previously described
(Shimada and LaMotte, 2008). Behavioral scoring was performed while blind to experimental condi-
tion and mouse genotype. All scratching and wiping behavior videos were recorded for 1 hr. Itch
behavior was scored for the first 30 min and acute pain was scored for the first five minutes. Bout
number and length were recorded.
For radiant heat and von Frey hypersensitivity behavior, drugs were injected intradermally into
the plantar surface of the hindpaw (20 mL). Radiant heat assays were performed using the IITC Life
Science Hargreaves test system. Mechanical threshold was measured using calibrated von Frey
monofilaments (Touch Test) on a metal grate platform (IITC). Von Frey was performed as previously
described (Tsunozaki et al., 2013; Chaplan et al., 1994) using the up-down method (Dixon, 1965)
while blinded to compound injected and genotype, or a descending force-series of 4 trials per force
from 0.4 g to 6 g. Valid responses for both von Frey and radiant heat included fast paw withdrawal,
licking/biting/shaking of the affected paw, or flinching. For radiant heat and von Frey, mice were
allowed to acclimate on platform for 1 hr before injection. Measurements were taken 15 min pre-
injection and 20–30 min post-injection for all compounds used.
The pinprick assay (Duan et al., 2014) was conducted on a von Frey testing platform (IITC). The
mouse hindpaw was poked with a 31 g syringe needle without breaking the skin to induce fast acute
mechanical pain. Each paw was stimulated 10 times with the needle, with five minutes rest in
between trials, and the % withdrawal (fast withdrawal, licking/biting/shaking of paw, squeaking, and/
or flinching) was calculated from the total number of trials.
The tape assay was conducted according to previously described methods (Ranade et al., 2014).
Number of attempts to remove a 3 cm piece of lab tape was recorded for 10 min after manual tape
application to the rostral back. Scorer and experimenter were blinded to genotype.
For righting reflex measurements, age-matched S1pr3-/- and +/+ P6-7 neonates were used. Briefly,
pups were overturned one at a time on the home cage lid while experimenter was blinded to geno-
type. The time to righting was measured to the nearest 1/10th of a second with a stopwatch.
For the CFA model of hypersensitivity, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and
injected with 15 mL CFA (Sigma) into one hindpaw using a Hamilton syringe (30 g) at 5pm. Radiant
heat latencies and von Frey 50% withdrawal thresholds were recorded one day prior to CFA, the
morning of CFA (prior to injection), and one and two days post-CFA. Von Frey measurements were
acquired before radiant heat latencies, and mice were allowed a one-hour recovery period in home
cage with access to food and water in between testing. Both ipsilateral and contralateral paw were
measured. Experimenter was blind to genotype for injections and recording.
All behavior experiments were carried out using age-matched or littermate cohorts of male mice
and conducted between 8 am and 1 pm. Mice were tested in 4-part behavior chambers (IITC Life
Sciences) with opaque dividers (TAP Plastics) with the exception of righting reflex measurements.

Scratching and wiping behaviors were filmed from below using high-definition cameras. All experi-
ments were performed under the policies and recommendations of the International Association for
the Study of Pain and approved by the University of California, Berkeley Animal Care and Use
Committee.
In situ hybridization (ISH)
Fresh DRG were dissected from 8 to 12 week old mice, flash frozen in OCT embedding medium,
and sectioned at 14 mm onto slides. ISH was performed using Affymetrix Quantigene ViewISH Tissue
2-plex kit according to manufacturer’s instructions with Type 1 (S1pr3) and Type 6 (all other) probes.
The following probes against mouse mRNAs were created by Affymetrix and used for ISH: S1pr3,
Scn1a, Npy2r, Piezo2, Trpv1, Trpa1.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of DRG
DRG were dissected from 8 to 12 week old adult mice and post-fixed in 4% PFA for one hour. DRG
were cryo-protected overnight at 4˚C in 30% sucrose-PBS, embedded in OCT, and then cryosec-
tioned at 12 mm onto slides. Briefly, slides were washed 3x in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100), blocked in
2.5% horse serum +2.5% BSA PBST, and incubated overnight at 4˚C in 1:1000 primary antibody in
PBST +0.5% horse serum +0.5% BSA. Slides were washed 3X in PBS then incubated 1–2 hr at RT in
1:1000 secondary antibody. Slides were washed 3X in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G +DAPI
with No. 1.5 coverglass. Primary antibodies used: Rabbit anti-DsRed (Clontech #632496), Rabbit
anti-S1PR3 (Abcam #38324; #108370), Mouse anti-NF200 (Sigma #N5389), Chicken anti-Peripherin
(Abcam #39374). Secondary antibodies used: Goat anti-Mouse Alexa 488 (Abcam #150117), Goat
anti-Chicken Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher #A11039), Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594 (Invitrogen #R37117).
Isolectin B4 (IB4)-FITC (Enzo Life Sciences #ALX-650–001F-MC05) was also used. Slides were
mounted in Fluoromount with No. 1.5 coverglass. Imaging of DRG ISH and IHC experiments, and all
live-cell imaging, was performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope with a Lambda LS-xl light source
(Sutter Instruments). For DRG ISH and IHC analysis, images were analyzed using FIJI software.
Briefly, DAPI-positive cells were circled and their fluorescence intensity (AFU) for all channels was
plotted against cell size using Microsoft Excel software. Co-labeling analysis was performed using
FIJI. Intensity thresholds were set based on the negative control (no probe) slide. Cells were defined
as co-expressing if their maximum intensities exceeded the threshold for both channels of interest.
IHC of sectioned skin
Skin was dissected from 8 week old adult mice and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at RT. DRG
were cryo-protected overnight at 4˚C in 30% sucrose-PBS, embedded in OCT, and then sectioned at
18 mm onto slides. Briefly, slides were blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBST (0.1% Triton X-100)
and incubated overnight at 4˚C in 1:1000 primary antibody in blocking buffer. Slides were washed
3X in PBS then incubated 45 min at RT in 1:1000 secondary antibody. Slides were washed 5X in PBS
and mounted in Fluoromount-G +DAPI with No. 1.5 coverglass. Primary antibodies used: Rabbit
anti-DsRed (Clontech #632496), Chicken anti-NefH (Abcam #4680), Chicken anti-b-tubulin III (Abcam
#107216), mouse anti-PGP9.5 (Abcam #8189). Secondary antibodies used: Goat anti-Mouse Alexa
488 (Abcam #150117), Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594 (Invitrogen #R37117), Goat anti-Chicken Alexa
488 (ThermoFisher #A11039). For co-localization analysis, only fibers for which >50% of the length of
the visible fiber contained co-localized (white) pixels were counted. Image analysis was performed
using FIJI.
Whole mount skin IHC
Staining was performed according to Marshall et al. (2016). Briefly, 8-week-old mice were eutha-
nized and the back skin was shaved, depilated, and tape-stripped. The removed skin was fixed over-
night in 4% PFA, then washed in PBS (3X for 10 min each). Dermal fat was scraped away with a
scalpel and skin was washed in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100; 3X for two hours each) then incubated in
1:500 primary antibody (Rabbit anti DsRed: Clontech #632496; Chicken anti-Nefh: Abcam #4680) in
blocking buffer (PBST with 5% goat serum and 20% DMSO) for 5.5 days at 4˚C. Skin was washed as
before and incubated in 1:500 secondary antibody (Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594; Invitrogen #R37117;
Goat anti-Chicken Alexa 488; ThermoFisher #A11039) in blocking buffer for 3 days at 4˚C. Skin was

washed in PBST, serially dried in methanol: PBS solutions, incubated overnight in 100% methanol,
and finally cleared with a 1:2 solution of benzyl alcohol: benzyl benzoate (BABB; Sigma) before
mounting between No. 1.5 coverglass. Sectioned and whole mount skin samples were imaged on a
Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with OPO using a 20x water objective. Image analysis was per-
formed using FIJI.
Cell culture
Cell culture was carried out as previously described (Wilson et al., 2011). Briefly, neurons from dor-
sal root ganglia (2–8 week old adults) or trigeminal ganglia (P0) were dissected and incubated for 10
min in 1.4 mg ml 1 Collagenase P (Roche) in Hanks calcium-free balanced salt solution, followed by
incubation in 0.25% standard trypsin (vol/vol) STV versene-EDTA solution for 2 min with gentle agita-
tion. Cells were then triturated, plated onto Poly D-Lysine coated glass coverslips and used within
20 hr. Media: MEM Eagle’s with Earle’s BSS medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (vol/vol),
MEM vitamins, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine.
Calcium imaging
Ca2+ imaging experiments were carried out as previously described (Wilson et al., 2011). Cells were
loaded for 60 min at room temperature with 10 mM Fura-2AM supplemented with 0.01% Pluronic
F-127 (wt/vol, Life Technologies) in a physiological Ringer’s solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5
KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2 and 10 D-(+)-glucose, pH 7.4. All chemicals were purchased from
Sigma. Acquired images were displayed as the ratio of 340 nm/ 380 nm. Cells were identified as
neurons by eliciting depolarization with high potassium Ringer’s solution (75 mM) at the end of each
experiment. Responding neurons were defined as those having a > 15% increase from baseline ratio.
Image analysis and statistics were performed using automated routines in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics).
Fura-2 ratios were normalized to the baseline ratio F340/F380 = (Ratio)/(Ratio t = 0).
In vitro electrophysiology
Electrophysiological experiments were carried out as previously described (Wilson et al., 2011).
Briefly, recordings were collected at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz (Axopatch 200B, pClamp software).
Electrode resistance ranged between 1.5–5 MW. Internal solution contained 140 mM KCl, 2 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM Na2ATP, 100 mM GTP, and 100 mM cAMP (pH 7.4). Bath
solution was physiological Ringer’s solution. The pipette potential was canceled before seal forma-
tion. Cell capacitance was canceled before whole cell voltage-clamp recordings. For mechanonoci-
ceptors experiments, only cells which were visually identified as mCherry expressing and which had
a capacitance between 40–80 pF were used. Rheobase was calculated as the smallest current step
required to elicit an action potential using current steps of 50 pA. M currents were measured and
analyzed using standard protocols for DRG neurons reported in the literature (Schu¨tze et al., 2016;
Crozier et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2013). Experiments were carried out only on cells with a series
resistance of less than 30 MW. Analysis of electrophysiology data was performed in pClamp and
IgorPro.
Ex vivo skin-nerve electrophysiology
Touch-evoked responses in the skin were recorded after dissecting the hind limb skin and saphenous
nerve from 7 to 10 week old mice, according to published methods (Wellnitz et al., 2010;
Maksimovic et al., 2014). The skin was placed epidermis-side-up in a custom chamber and perfused
with carbogen-buffered synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF) kept at 32˚C with a temperature controller
(model TC-344B, Warner Instruments). The nerve was kept in mineral oil in a recording chamber,
teased apart, and placed onto a gold recording electrode connected with a reference electrode to a
differential amplifier (model 1800, A-M Systems). The extracellular signal was digitized using a
PowerLab 8/35 board (AD Instruments) and recorded using LabChart software (AD Instruments).
For these studies, we focused on A-mechanonociceptors (AMs). To identify responses from these
afferents in mutant and control genotypes, we used a mechanical search paradigm with a fine glass
probe. Afferents were classified as AMs according to the following criteria: (1) conduction velocity
(approximately, one to (12 m/ s 1), (2) medium-sized receptive fields, (3) sustained response to
mechanical indentation (Wellnitz et al., 2010; Koltzenburg, 1997; Zimmermann et al., 2009).

Touch-sensitive afferents that did not meet these criteria were not analyzed further. Responses
were classified as Adapting AMs if the ratio of mean firing rate in the dynamic phase of stimulation
(first 0.2 s) to the static phase of stimulation (last 4.8 s) was greater than 2, and Non-Adapting AMs if
the ratio was less than or equal to 2. Non-responders (Figure 6F) responded to suprathreshold
mechanical stimulation with von Frey monofilaments (tip diameter <0.5 mm), but not to maximal
controlled mechanical stimulation (256 mN, tip diameter 2 mm). All recordings and analyses were
performed blind to genotype.
Mechanical responses were elicited with von Frey monofilaments and a force controlled custom-
built mechanical stimulator. Mechanical thresholds were defined as the lowest von Frey monofila-
ment to reliable elicit at least on action potential. Force controlled mechanical stimuli were delivered
using a computer controlled, closed-loop, mechanical stimulator (Model 300C-I, Aurora Scientific, 2
mm tip diameter). Low-pass filtered, 5 s long, length control steps (square wave) simultaneously
delivered with permissive force control steps (square wave) were generated using LabChart software
(AD Instruments). An arbitrarily selected force step-and-hold protocol (8, 32, 4, 64, 128, 16, 256 mN)
was delivered to all fibers. The period between successive displacements was 60 s.
Conduction velocity was measured by electrically stimulating identified receptive fields. Spike
sorting by principal component analysis (PCA) and density based clustering, and data analysis was
performed off-line with custom-made software in MATLAB. Statistics were performed in Prism.
Flow cytometry of CFA-treated hind paws
CFA injections were performed as described above. Briefly, hindpaw skin and underlying fascia of
treated and PBS-injected paws were removed from freshly euthanized mice. Skin was placed in RPMI
media (Gibco) on ice before mincing with dissection scissors. Digestions were performed for 90 min
at 37˚C on a rotating platform in 1 mL RPMI supplemented with 1:1000 DNaseI enzyme (Roche) and
one unit LiberaseTM (Roche). Skin was then filtered through 70 mm nylon mesh (Falcon), washed in
RPMI, and resuspended in PBS for Aqua Live-Dead staining. Samples were then transferred to FACS
buffer (PBS with 0.5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA), blocked, then surface stained with the following anti-
bodies: cKit-Biotin, FceRI-PE, CD49b-PECy7, SiglecF-APC, SA-FITC, Ly6C-PerCP, CD11b-PB, Ly6G-
BV785, CD45.2-AF700. Compensation tubes (single-stain) were prepared for each fluorophore using
positive and negative control beads. A spleen from a wild-type animal was also prepared by crushing
between frosted glass slides, straining through 70 mm nylon mesh, and lysing of erythrocytes in ACK
(Gibco). A portion of spleen sample was heat-killed for 10 min at 65˚C and stained with Aqua viabil-
ity stain and set aside. The rest of the spleen was stained normally with the other skin samples. Sam-
ples were then run through a flow cytometer (BD Fortessa). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Prism)
and Microsoft Excel. Neutrophils were defined as live single cells with the following staining profile:
CD45.2+/CD11b+/Ly6G+/Ly6C+. Inflammatory monocytes were defined as the following: CD45.2+/
CD11b+/Ly6G-/Ly6Chigh. Total number of immune cells was reported, rather than percentage of
total, since neither genotype differed significantly in total number of live cells or total number of
CD45.2+ immune cells.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses, except for skin nerve data (see above), were performed using IgorPro soft-
ware or Microsoft Excel. Values are reported as the mean ±SEM where multiple independent experi-
ments are pooled and reported (for whole cell electrophysiology), and mean ±SD where one
experiment was performed with multiple wells (for calcium imaging) or mice (for behavior). For com-
parison between two groups, Student’s unpaired 2-tailed t-test was used. A paired t-test was
employed only for measurements within the same biological replicate and after a given treatment.
For single-point comparison between >2 groups, a one-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post
hoc test was used, depending on comparison. For the time course comparison between two groups,
2-way ANOVA was used and single comparison p-values were derived using Tukey’s HSD or appro-
priate statistical test, depending on comparison. Number of mice or samples required to attain sig-
nificance was not calculated beforehand, and where multiple statistical tests were performed, a
Bonferroni correction was applied. In figure legends, significance was labeled as: n.s., not significant,
p0.05; *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.
