This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-
754, an AAV8-based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector de-
signed to deliver a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B
domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-
speciﬁc promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemo-
philia A. A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity
was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0  1012
TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase
was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent
decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efﬁcacy assay. TAK-
754 (3.1  1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable
FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic hu-
man FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments
with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between
1.9  1012 and 5.0  1013 CP/kg were conducted in male
C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without
TAK-754-related
adverse
clinical
signs.
Biodistribution
proﬁling showed predominant detection in the liver with a
low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration
site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no
observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations
in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma
formation within the observation period. These preclinical
studies demonstrate a good safety and efﬁcacy proﬁle for
TAK-754.
INTRODUCTION
Hemophilia A is a monogenic X chromosome-linked inherited
bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene encoding
blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to the loss of functional
FVIII protein.1–3 This lifelong disorder requires treatment with
replacement factor concentrates to maintain FVIII levels to control
and prevent bleeding episodes.1,4 Patients with severe disease can
experience recurrent joint and muscle bleeding and may receive
regular FVIII infusions to prevent the debilitating effects of
arthropathy and to reduce their risk of life-threatening bleeds.4,5
Another more recent treatment option is the bispeciﬁc antibody
emicizumab, which mimics FVIII function by binding FIXa and
FX to promote hemostasis.6
Monogenic diseases are promising indications for potentially curative
gene therapeutic approaches,7 and in particular, hemophilia A has
become a showcase indication for exploring and reﬁning in vivo
gene therapy principles.8 This is due to the fact that the expression
of FVIII from the introduced functional copy of the F8 transgene
into a patient’s liver cells can be readily measured in plasma, and rela-
tively low levels of FVIII are already sufﬁcient to alleviate a severe dis-
ease phenotype. For adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, this needs
to be accomplished by a truncated, B domain-deleted (BDD) variant
of FVIII (BDD-FVIII) because of the restricted packaging capacity of
AAV, which is 5 kb at the most, excluding the ﬂanking inverted ter-
minal repeat (ITR) regions. Nonetheless, ample preclinical experience
has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, which also leads to
improvements in vector design.9–12
Several investigational hemophilia A gene therapy products built
on this concept are being tested clinically,13 and the most
advanced program has already received marketing authorization
(Valoctocogene roxaparvovec), employing an AAV5 vector de-
signed to express a human BDD-FVIII variant called FVIII-
SQ.14,15 Three years of follow-up data demonstrated a sustained,
clinically relevant beneﬁt at doses of 4  1013 and 6  1013 vg
(vector genomes)/kg, but also identiﬁed a decline in FVIII expres-
sion levels over time, suggesting that this therapy will not be life-
long.15 Other observations difﬁcult to explain to date are the vari-
ability in expression between individuals at a given dose and
between participants in phase 1/2 and phase 3.15 These observa-
tions have not been made in conceptually similar clinical hemo-
philia B gene therapy trials and appear to be associated with the
nature of the transgene product, as synthesis of FVIII at high levels
in hepatocytes is constrained and prone to trigger an unfolded
protein response that could lead to cellular stress.16

Past and present hemophilia trials further revealed that vector immu-
nogenicity can negatively affect the durability of transgene expres-
sion,17–19 reﬂected in a drop or even loss of activity within the ﬁrst
couple of months after treatment that is often accompanied by a tran-
sient rise in liver enzymes. While ultimately a cytotoxic T cell
response against the capsid protein contributes to this phenomenon,
other host immune responses elicited by the inherent immunogenic
features of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are likely to be
involved.20,21 The presence of (an excess of) unmethylated cytosine-
guanine dinucleotides (CpG) motifs in the vg is particularly impor-
tant in that respect as CpG clusters, which are typically present
only in microbials, act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) in humans and can trigger an innate immune response.
The removal of such CpG clusters from vg is therefore thought to
be a key measure for dampening innate immune signals that eventu-
ally lead to deleterious adaptive immune responses.22
Here, we describe preclinical development of the recombinant single-
stranded (ss) gene therapy vector TAK-754 (formerly BAX 888 and
SHP654; Baxalta US, Lexington, MA) designed for the treatment of
patients with hemophilia A. The vector was built on the AAV8 capsid
with a preferential liver tropism and engineered to deliver a human
codon-optimized and CpG-depleted BDD-F8 transgene under the
control of a liver-speciﬁc transthyretin (TTR) promoter. This paper
details the identiﬁcation of the lead candidate vector ssAAV8.BDD-
FVIII and reports on preclinical studies aimed at evaluating the efﬁ-
cacy and safety of the TAK-754 human gene therapy vector in mice.
RESULTS
Lead candidate screening of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt
Expression levels of endogenous wild-type (WT) FVIII levels are rela-
tively low,23 and the corresponding coding region exceeds the natural
packaging limit for AAV. We addressed this by cloning codon-opti-
mized BDD-F8 open reading frames in an AAV expression cassette
designed for high expression levels in human hepatocytes (Figure 1A).
A total of 41 codon-optimized ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (se-
quences 01–41) were produced and screened for potency in FVIII
knockout (KO) mice. FVIII KO mice closely reﬂect the severe hemo-
philia A phenotype in patients and therefore represent a suitable an-
imal model. Expression was compared to animals receiving the
ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIwt control vector (sequence wt) harboring the
WT F8 nucleotide sequence. The best candidate of this in vivo bio-
potency screen was sequence (seq) 04, with 79.8% nucleotide
sequence identity to the corresponding coding sequences in WT F8

(GenBank: M14113) and 74-fold improved efﬁcacy (Figure 1B). The
guanine-cytosine (GC) content of seq04 was 56%, which is substan-
tially higher than that of the WT sequence (44%) and matches the
native AAV8 capsid protein coding sequence (Figure S1; Table S1).
Moreover, CpG motifs in seq04 were low in number and dispersed
over the length of the transgene (Figure S2). This feature should
help minimize the immunogenicity risk, as high densities of these
DNA motifs can increase immunogenicity by stimulating the innate
immune system via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in the liver.24
Despite a vector size of approximately 5.2 kb, the recombinant
genome appears as a single homogeneous band following DNA gel
analysis (Figure 1C), conﬁrming correct packaging of the slightly
oversized genome of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 (relative to an
AAV WT genome of 4.7 kb). The same held true for the other
AAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (data not shown). Overall capsid integrity
and purity of the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 preparation was
conﬁrmed following SDS PAGE-based size separation and detection
of VP1, VP2, and VP3 by silver staining (Figure 1D). Initial yields for
the seq04 vector per liter cell culture were about 6-fold higher than for
the otherwise identical F8 WT nucleotide sequence vector,25 indi-
cating that vector production using the F8 lead candidate sequence
was actually more efﬁcient, probably due to its GC content matching
the GC content of the AAV8 virus (Figure S1).
These
favorable
features

the
rationale
to
select
ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 as the lead candidate for the develop-
ment of a hemophilia A gene therapy vector.
Biopotency and hemostatic efﬁcacy of TAK-754
In anticipation of clinical trials of TAK-754 gene therapy in patients
with hemophilia A, we optimized our vector titration approach,
which was previously based on a qualiﬁed qPCR of vg with a coefﬁ-
cient of variation (CV) higher than 25% (data not shown). We there-
fore considered changing the genomic titering regime toward assay-
ing AAV capsid particle (CP) numbers by ELISA, as the latter assay
reproducibly showed a CV of <10%. The robust performance of the
CP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), together with a
consistent full to empty capsid ratio of the vector batches produced,26
provided the rationale to assign the vector strength for subsequent
preclinical development of TAK-754, as well as for clinical dosing
in a phase 1/2 study.
The FVIII activity dose response and hemostatic efﬁcacy of TAK-754
was examined in FVIII KO mice following vector delivery at doses of
3.0  1011, 1.2  1012, or 3.0  1012 CP/kg. A preliminary safety assess-
ment was included as a secondary endpoint. Animals that tested posi-
tive for anti-FVIII antibodies were excluded from statistical analysis of
biopotency and efﬁcacy. No treatment-related ﬁndings were observed
microscopically in the heart, kidney, liver, or spleen, including micro-
or macrovascular thrombosis or inﬂammatory inﬁltrate.
Animals that received 1.2  1012 or 3.0  1012 CP/kg showed a dose-
dependent increase in mean plasma FVIII activity from 0.6 to 1.9 IU/
mL over the investigation period (Figure 2A). FVIII activity was un-
detectable in animals treated with buffer or the lowest dose of
3.0  1011 CP/kg. Dose-dependent activity of TAK-754 was
conﬁrmed in the human hepatic HepG2 cell line (Figure S3).
A tail-tip bleeding assay was used to assess the bleeding phenotype.
Animals treated with buffer and TAK-754 at the lowest dose showed
similar median blood loss normalized for body weights of 6.1 and
7.5 mg/g, respectively, corresponding to the undetectable FVIII ac-
tivity in these animals (Figure 2B). The higher doses (1.2  1012 or
3.0  1012 CP/kg) of TAK-754 signiﬁcantly reduced median blood
loss to 0.6 and 0.4 mg/g, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner
(p < 0.001 compared to buffer). Statistical assessment of dose pro-
portionality was precluded by the lack of FVIII activity at the
low dose.
At the end of the experiment, livers of animals with activities around
the mean FVIII activity were selected from each group for quantiﬁca-
tion of vg and F8 RNA expression. The vg levels in the control group
or the low-dose TAK-754 group were under the detection limit of the
applied method. Mid- and high-dose animals showed robust and
dose-dependent transduction as a function of vg in the liver (Fig-
ure 2C). F8 RNA levels were consistent with F8 DNA levels, except
for two low-dose animals showing a measurable F8 transcript signal
(i.e., within the limit of detection). The 2.5-fold dose increase from
1.2  1012 to 3.0  1012 CP/kg resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in F8
gDNA levels and a 3.1-fold increase in F8 RNA levels (Figure 2C),
which broadly mirrored the 3.2-fold increase in FVIII activity levels
(Figure 2A).
TAK-754-mediated long-term expression of FVIII
The development of an antibody response directed against the human
FVIII xenoproteincapable of neutralizingFVIII activity is a well-known
phenomenon in mice.27 To enable a long-term expression study
following the delivery of TAK-754, we employed a transgenic mouse
model (huFVIII tg mice) that lacks detectable FVIII protein but usually
showsimmunologicaltolerancetowardthehumancoagulationfactor.28
huFVIII tg mice were injected with a TAK-754 dose of 3.1  1012 CP/kg
and were monitored for FVIII activity and anti-drug antibodies from 2
to24weeks. Themean FVIIIplasma activity rangedbetween 2.9 and 3.8
IU/mL throughout the observation period (Figure 3A). Three of 30 an-
imals tested positive for anti-BDD-FVIII immunoglobulin-binding an-
tibodies. In one of these three animals, the antibody response appeared
to be transient, as it tested negative in week 24. One of the two persistent
binding antibodies-positive animals also tested positive for FVIII inhib-
itory antibodies (data not shown). No treatment-related clinical symp-
toms or deaths were recorded.
Nonclinical safety evaluation and biodistribution study in
hemostatically normal mice
The toxicity of gene therapy candidate TAK-754 was examined in co-
horts of male C57BL/6J mice receiving a single dose of TAK-754 at
2.0  1012, 3.8  1012, and 9.5  1012 CP/kg, and also at higher
dose levels up to 5.0  1013 CP/kg (1.0  1013, 3.0  1013, and
5.0  1013 CP/kg). The dose levels were selected based on the

TAK-754 activity data shown in Figure 2A. The design of the toxicity
study entailed subjecting cohorts of animals to a panel of analyses
that included complete necropsies, pathological evaluation, bio-
distribution of vg, FVIII activity, FVIII antigen, binding anti-BDD-
FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, and
binding anti-AAV8 antibodies at day 3, week 3, and week 18.

activity at four time points, including 14, 28, 42, and 56 days. FVIII activity levels were below the lower limit of quantiﬁcation (LLOQ) in controls and the low-dose group but

During the study, there were no deaths and no adverse effects attrib-
uted to TAK-754 during the in-life phase, pathology, post-dosing
observations, or any adverse TAK-754-related changes in clinical
chemistry parameters, hematology, and coagulation parameters or
urinalysis.
The distribution of TAK-754 DNA was highest in the liver at all dose
levels tested. TAK-754 distribution in liver and other tissues was dose
related and was generally highest at the earliest time point, decreasing
by day 21 (Figure 3B). However, TAK-754 DNA levels were still high-
est in liver tissues at this time point. Further decrease by day 126 is
already diminished in the liver and skeletal muscle and not observed
in lymph node and heart any longer. TAK-754 DNA levels in brain
and testes samples harvested from TAK-754-treated animals were
evaluated as negative or below the lower limit of assay quantiﬁcation
by week 18 in all animals. Representative data are shown from the
9.5  1012 CP/kg dose group (Figure 3B).
Animals treated with TAK-754 had measurable amounts of human
FVIII antigen in plasma from week 3, with levels in some mice already
present from day 3. The observed decrease in FVIII antigen concen-
trations in individual animals was most likely a result of the formation
of circulating anti-human BDD-FVIII binding antibodies, which can
compete with the species-speciﬁc assay, resulting in nondetectable
FVIII antigen. Such binding antibodies indeed formed over time
and increased with dose, which is in line with a pharmacokinetic anal-
ysis where FVIII immunogenicity increased with initial high-level
AAV-FVIII protein expression.29

box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a
horizontal line and the mean represented by a cross. (B)
Vector biodistribution. Wild-type C57Bl/6J mice were
treated with a TAK-754 dose of 9.5  1012 CP/kg, and
vector biodistribution was determined at three time
points, including 3 days, 3 weeks, and 18 weeks (n =
20). Data are given in mean ± SEM; values <LLOQ were
included as zero.
TAK-754-treated animals also showed higher
FVIII activity levels compared with the pre-
treatment period, indicating that BDD-FVIII
was expressed in these mice. However, some an-
imals had even lower-than-normal FVIII levels
most likely caused by the generation of neutral-
izing anti-human-BDD-FVIII antibodies that
inhibited both human BDD-FVIII activity and
endogenous mouse FVIII activity by virtue of
the antibodies’ partial cross-reactivity against
mouse FVIII. Neutralizing antibodies against
BDD-FVIII became measurable by week 18 in
all dose groups. As expected, all treated animals
tested strongly positive for anti-AAV8 binding antibodies from
week 3.
In summary, toxicology experiments in mice receiving single intrave-
nous (i.v.) TAK-754 injections at doses up to 5.0  1013 CP/kg found
no evidence of TAK-754-related adverse effects during the in-life
phase and no toxicologically relevant observations. The no-
observed-adverse-effect level was 5.0  1013 cp/kg, the highest dose
tested.
Integration site analysis
While host cell maintenance of rAAV vectors is largely accomplished
through episomal DNA, residual chromosomal integration does
occur. We therefore performed an integration site (IS) analysis of
the TAK-754 vector in FVIII KO mice. Mice were treated with either
2.0  1012 or 1.0  1013 CP/kg TAK-754 and observed for 1 or
4 months (Figure 4). Liver transduction levels, determined by F8
qPCR, were dose dependent and comparable at both time points
(Figure S4).
Illumina sequencing of nonrestrictive (nr)linear ampliﬁcation-medi-
ated (LAM)-PCR products showed comparable numbers of average
sequencing reads for both time points after vector administration
(Table S2). A total of 227 unique exactly mappable ISs were detected
in animals in both groups at 1 month after gene therapy treatment
(5–54 unique ISs/mouse). Four months after treatment, 187 unique
exactly mappable ISs were retrieved from both groups (5–42 unique
ISs/mice), conﬁrming an integration frequency of %0.01% (Table S2).

The detection of identical top 10 ranking ISs in repetitive (nr)LAM-
PCR amplicons was very low: one IS 1 month after treatment and 3
ISs detected in 2/6 (nr)LAM-PCRs after 4 months (Figure 4). This in-
dicates that the unequal IS frequency proﬁles are due to the low num-
ber of events retrieved and that there are no signs for clonal skewing
or clonal dominance in the treated animals. Only low-order (%4)
common ISs could be identiﬁed at both time points, which is in
line with the low number of ISs detected after administration of
TAK-754, correlating with an untargeted integration proﬁle. None
of the ISs were found in or next to genes previously implicated in he-
patocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation.30
In summary, the integration proﬁle of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mouse
liver showed a low but measurable level of integration, with no signs
of potential side effects, and, at least within the 4-month observation
period, no evidence for clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in
oncogenes (i.e., HCC) was noted.
DISCUSSION
Here, we describe preclinical development of TAK-754, an efﬁcient
human AAV vector for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia
A, designed to express a human BDD-FVIII protein with an identical
amino acid sequence to that of recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa.31
While the vector was designed and developed at a time before ﬁrst
clinical readouts from hemophilia A gene therapy trials became avail-
able, it does bear a couple of features that should allow efﬁcient
expression of the human F8 transgene in humans.
TAK-754 vector design
Choice of the AAV8 capsid was based on its preferential tropism for
the liver as it demonstrates excellent transduction efﬁciency of hepa-
tocytes in preclinical models32 and a number of liver-directed clinical
gene therapy trials such as those for the treatment of hemophilia A
and B or glycogen storage disease type 1A build on this capsid sero-
type.33 Numerous comparative studies over the last couple of years
consolidated our comprehension of a species-dependent performance
of vector capsids.34 It is now clear that AAV8 is particularly efﬁcient
in rodents; in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans, the capsid
also preferentially targets hepatocytes but with an approximately
20-fold lower efﬁciency.35 This correlation factor needs to be consid-
ered when it comes to the deduction of a clinical starting dose from
the nonclinical data package. Accordingly, a starting dose of
2.0  1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector was selected for the ﬁrst cohort,
taking into account that a dose of 3.0  1012 CP/kg in FVIII KO
mice resulted in a mean plasma FVIII activity of 1.9 IU/mL, trans-
lating into a projected clinical FVIII activity of 6% of normal.
It is worth noting that the packaging capacity of recombinant AAV8
vectors can be pushed beyond the size of the WT genome of 4.7 kb.36
Consistently, we found that TAK-754’s vg was the correct size and
intact, as judged by the absence of degradation bands. Packaging of
similarly oversized BDD-FVIII expression cassettes using AAV537
and AAVrh838 led to aberrant, truncated genomes that ﬁrst had to
be re-assembled in transduced cells through recombination before
functional FVIII could have been produced.
The use of the strong yet compact mouse TTR promoter/enhancer
combination enabled robust liver-speciﬁc gene expression. This pro-
moter was selected from a variety of liver-speciﬁc promoters during
preclinical development of the hemophilia B vector BAX33539 and
came off well in a head-to-head comparison with other commonly
used liver-speciﬁc promoters.40 The risk of relying on nonconserved
murine transcription factor binding sites for a human gene therapy
was mitigated by our demonstration of robust BDD-FVIII expression
in the human liver HepG2 cell line upon transduction with TAK-754.
Activity of the mouse TTR promoter/enhancer was also conﬁrmed in
the clinical trials for BAX33518 and SPK-8011,41 although in the latter
case, a point-mutated promoter variant was used that has converted a
weak hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) binding site into a moder-
ately stronger one.
Codon optimization of the BDD-F8 transgene initially relied on avail-
able codon-optimization algorithms. This approach resulted in se-
quences with improved expression but also greater GC content, in
line with the understanding that this leads to higher mRNA levels
and greater protein translation than gene sequences having greater
AT content.42 However, this inadvertently introduced CpG clusters
into the vector sequence, which function as PAMPs. These sequences
can stimulate innate immune responses through signaling via TLRs,
leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response.22,43,44 TAK-
754 candidate screening thus included a further ﬁltering step that
removed codon-optimized F8 sequences harboring potentially detri-
mental predicted CpG clusters.45 The lead candidate F8 nucleotide
sequence (seq04) gave rise to a 74-fold increased expression in
FVIII-KO mice compared to the corresponding WT sequence yet
contains only 17 dispersed CpG motifs (Figures S2A and S2B). A
further depletion of CpG motifs within the entire expression cassette,
which may likewise be important for durable transgene expression,13
has not been carried out (Figure S2B).
Preclinical evaluation of TAK-754
Overall, the vector showed a good efﬁcacy and safety proﬁle. Dose-
dependent increases in mean plasma FVIII activity were obtained after
single i.v. injections of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mice. The observed vari-
ability of FVIII expression (Figure 2A) appears to be a transgene-spe-
ciﬁc phenomenon. While FIX expression is associated with a low inter-
species variability,46 that of BDD-FVIII is consistently higher and
observed in mice and humans. Reports investigating the underlying
mechanisms of inter-individual variability of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ (Va-
loctocogene roxaparvovec) expression concluded that multiple host-
mediated factors could contribute.47,48 Future endeavors to identify
predictive biomarkers of response might lead to the development of ap-
proaches with optimized outcomes of AAV-based F8 gene therapies.
A TAK-754-mediated dose response of FVIII activity was conﬁrmed
in a HepG2 cellular biopotency assay. Such an in vitro assay could
allow replacement of the cumbersome in vivo lot release testing

procedure, in line with the expectations and requirements of the au-
thorities, which support the reduction and circumvention of animal
experiments in the release of clinical batches, if applicable.49
Dose-dependent efﬁcacy was observed in the tail tip bleeding assay in
FVIII KO mice, and long-term expression could be demonstrated in a
separate animal study using human FVIII transgenic mice, in which a
single dose of 4  1012 CP/kg resulted in FVIII expression from week
2 until the end of the experiment (6 months), with no trend for a
decline in FVIII activity. This mouse model, which was developed
to mitigate the issue of anti-human FVIII antibody formation,28
served its purpose to monitor TAK-754-dependent long-term expres-
sion of human BDD-FVIII. While this model also allows comparative
prediction of human immune responses elicited by human FVIII var-
iants via repeated dosing of the respective recombinant proteins ac-
cording to identical protein mass, this study setup could not be
mirrored with a gene therapy vector. Due to the further absence of
a gold standard vector regarding FVIII immunogenicity, we did not
aim for conducting a comparative FVIII immunogenicity study
with the TAK-754 vector. It is important to note that the model falls
short in predicting the FVIII expression decline based on AAV vector
immunogenicity, which is a phenomenon known to be largely absent
from typical preclinical animal models.
No toxicologically relevant effects related to TAK-754 were observed.
Single bolus injections of TAK-754 administered to mice at doses of
up to 5  1013 CP/kg occurred without deaths, adverse clinical signs,
or post-dosing observations related to TAK-754. A limitation of the
mouse safety study was its duration of 18 weeks, which precluded
the detection of a potential relationship between FVIII expression
and liver cancer/hyperplasia, which can occur at time points later
than 1 year.50
The observed biodistribution of TAK-754 in treated FVIII KO mice
conﬁrmed the predominant detection of vector DNA in liver tissue,
with minimal off-target gene expression in other tissues, consistent
with the hepatic tropism of AAV8. Despite the known technical lim-
itations of (nr)LAM-PCR, IS analyses further showed that vector inte-
gration was minimal (<0.01%). Within the 4-month observation
period, there were also no observations of clonal outgrowth or
preferred integrations in or near genes previously implicated in
HCC formation. While these data suggest that in humans TAK-754
will be maintained episomally and pose a low genotoxicity risk to pa-
tients, caution is needed since HCC-relevant loci are not well
conserved between mice and humans,30 and the duration of the study
was too short to observe any HCC concerns.
Perspective
The preclinical development program showed a good efﬁcacy and
safety proﬁle for TAK-754 and formed the basis for deﬁning the start-
ing dose of 2.0  1012 CP/kg, factoring in the above-mentioned
mouse-to-human correlation factor for AAV8. Despite these prom-
ising data, based on the gathered clinical experience with liver-
directed AAV gene therapies over the last couple of years, it has
turned out that vector immunogenicity in humans appears more crit-
ical than in rodents or NHPs.51 A successful translation of preclinical
gene therapy programs into the clinic critically depends on the type
and strength of the immune responses elicited against the very gene
therapy vector in humans. In the case of TAK-754, while the safety
proﬁle was consistent with an AAV8-based gene therapy and all
four enrolled patients in the clinical trial (this study was registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03370172) showed dose-dependent peak
FVIII activity 4 to 9 weeks after infusion (cohort 1: 2.0  1012 CP/
kg [n = 2]: 3.8% and 11%, respectively; cohort 2: 6.0  1012 CP/kg
[n = 2]: 54.7% and 69.4%, respectively), the initial vector-derived
FVIII expression steadily declined despite the use of corticosteroids.52
The comprehensive analysis of immune components in the periph-
eral blood of the patients did not reveal the presence of inhibitory
anti-FVIII antibodies or any obvious signs of an exaggerated immune
response.53
It is worth mentioning in this context that NHPs as a nonrodent spe-
cies were excluded from preclinical safety testing mainly because of
technical challenges such as the naturally high AAV8 infection rate
in monkey populations.54,55 Since an AAV vector-induced immune
response leading to an abrupt or gradual loss in FVIII expression
has not been observed in NHPs,56 such a study would also likely
have failed to reveal an issue with the TAK-754 vector already in pre-
clinical stage.
A comparison with Valoctocogene roxaparvovec and other clinical-
stage hemophilia AAV vectors (Table 1) suggests that rather subtle
yet not fully understood differences in the vector design determine
the success or failure of a therapy.13 Several AAV-based hemophilia
A gene therapy clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov also
counted on AAV8, whereas other programs use different capsids,
including AAV5, AAV6, LK03, and AAVhu37, with potential differ-
ences in their tropism or transduction efﬁciency. Ranking these cap-
sids in terms of performance in humans is, however, difﬁcult since
all these vectors differ also in expression cassette design and
manufacturing process employed. Clinical head-to-head compari-
sons of vectors differing only in the capsid serotype are lacking
and would be difﬁcult to conduct for various reasons such as
cross-reactivity of anti-AAV antibodies against a broad range of
serotypes.
With regard to the expression cassettes, all vector products rely on
liver-speciﬁc promoter/enhancer combinations, with SPK8011 even
using the same mouse TTR promoter, albeit with a point mutation
in the HNF3 binding site reported to moderately increase transcrip-
tion.41 The SPK8011 cassette is unique in harboring a short synthetic
intron, which is likely to further improve transgene expression. All
but two (GO-8 and ASC618) transgenes were designed to express re-
combinant FVIII moroctocog alfa,31 although different algorithms for
codon optimization were likely used, which may substantially affect
expression efﬁciency. No relevant differences in expression levels
are expected from the poly(A) elements, all of which are short and
synthetic in nature.

From the publicly available data, it appears that not all codon-opti-
mized BDD-F8 transgene cDNAs have been depleted for CpG motifs
(Table 1). Whether the remaining 17 CpG motifs in TAK-754 caused
a more pronounced vector-mediated immune response compared to
that of SPK8011 (0 CpG) or Valoctocogene roxaparvovec (3 CpGs) is
difﬁcult to evaluate, but it seems unlikely as they are dispersed and do
not form a CpG cluster.45 Both the design of the expression cassette as
well as the clinical data available so far suggest that SPK8011 is the
most efﬁcient vector, enabling expression of BDD-FVIII at a dose
that falls within the tolerated capsid immune response window.
At the same time, however, it transpired over the last several years
that FVIII expression should be kept at a moderate level so as to avoid
an unfolded protein response in the transduced cells, leading to a
decline in FVIII activity.13,57 Efforts to optimize AAV-based F8
gene therapy should therefore focus on bioengineered FVIII con-
structs with a lower propensity to misfold in the endoplasmic reticu-
lum,58,59 accompanied by target tissue-speciﬁc analysis and develop-
ment of improved preclinical immunogenicity models, which in turn
will increase the ﬁeld’s understanding of the key features that make up
an effective gene therapy product for hemophilia A.

liver-speciﬁc TTR promoter/enhancer,60 the respective BDD-F8
transgene, and a synthetic polyadenylation site.61 Recombinant
ssAAV8 vectors were produced in suspension HEK293 cells using a
triple plasmid transfection protocol as described.62 Titers of AAV
vectors were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) or ELISA, reported in vg/mL or CP/mL, respectively.
vg titer determination
Vector genomes were quantiﬁed by qPCR targeting the AAV2 ITR
sequence as described.63 Sample preparation prior to PCR included
treatment of vector solutions with DNAseI, followed by a Proteinase
K step to release the AAV genome from the capsid. A ﬁnal restriction
enzyme digest with SmaI was performed to resolve AAV ITR T-shape
structures.
AAV titer determination by ELISA
The commercially available ELISA (Progen AAV8 titration ELISA
kit) contains a monoclonal antibody (ADK8) speciﬁc for a conforma-
tional epitope on assembled AAV8 capsids. The AAV8 capsid con-
centration was determined photometrically using plate-immobilized
biotinylated anti-AAV8 antibodies.
Vector DNA integrity assay
The integrity of the vg was analyzed by AAV agarose gel electropho-
resis performed as described.64 Brieﬂy, 1.5  1010 vg/lane were elec-
trophoresed in agarose gels, which were then stained in 2 GelRed
solution (Biotium) and imaged.
SDS-PAGE and silver staining
SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining was performed according to
standard procedures. Each lane contained 1.0  1010 vg of the respec-
tive viral construct and was separated on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel
(NuPAGE Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Silver staining was per-
formed with a SilverQuest kit (Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Animals
All animal experiments were approved by the relevant authorities on
animal experiments and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee. The experiments were performed with male mice only. Three
different strains were used: hemostatically normal C57BL/6J mice
(Charles River Laboratories) for the Good Laboratory Practice
toxicity study according to International Conference on Harmoniza-
tion S6, FVIII KO mice (B6; 129S4-F8tm2Kaz; E17 KO)65 for short-
term biopotency and efﬁcacy studies, where animals with an immune
response against the human FVIII xenoprotein were excluded from
further evaluation, and hFVIII transgenic mice28 for the long-term
expression study. In the latter strain, the murine F8 gene is knocked
out, but it also expresses human FVIII mRNA transcripts in multiple
tissues from transgenic human F8 cDNA while lacking detectable
circulating FVIII protein.
Vector administration
TAK-754 was administered with 0.01% human serum albumin to
mice aged 8–11 weeks via manual injection into the lateral caudal
vein (tail). A dose volume of 10 mL/kg was used, and individual
dose volumes were based on the individual body weight. An infusion
rate of approximately 2 mL/min was used.
Blood sampling
Immediately prior to blood collection, animals were anesthetized
with isoﬂurane. We collected 250-mL blood samples via puncture
of the retro-orbital plexus. At the end of the in-life phase, an addi-
tional and terminal cardiac blood sample (0.8 mL) was collected
from anesthetized animals. All blood samples were collected directly
in citrate anticoagulants and processed by centrifugation within
15 min.
Detection of hF8 DNA or RNA in mouse organs
Genomic DNA (gDNA) or total RNA was extracted from mouse
livers using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or the RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen), respectively, following the manufacturer’s protocol
for animal tissues. gDNA was quantiﬁed using the Qubit dsDNA
Broad-Range Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Total RNA (1 mg) was
treated with DNase (TURBO DNA-free Kit, Thermo Fisher Scienti-
ﬁc), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc). F8-transgene copy numbers in both gDNA and cDNA
samples were determined by qPCR. The nucleotide sequences of
the primers and probe used are the following: forward primer
50-TCATGGACACCCTGCCT-30; reverse primer 50-GAGAAGTG
GATGGAGTGAATGT-30; probe 50-6-FAM-ACCTGCTTTCTATG
GGCTCCAATGAG-MGB-30. PCR reactions were carried out on
the QuantStudio 7 Flex PCR platform (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
qPCR data analysis was performed using the speciﬁc device’s software
that automatically calculates the F8 copies per reaction based on the
linear regression parameters of the standard curve.
In vivo FVIII biopotency assay
FVIII activity in plasma was determined using a commercial FVIII
chromogenic assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(COATEST SP4 FVIII; catalog no. 82409463, Chromagenix). Results
are given in IU FVIII/mL, derived from a reference curve generated
with an in-house FVIII reference, calibrated against the World Health
Organization standard.
FVIII antigen assay
Human FVIII antigen levels in mouse plasma were analyzed by com-
mercial ELISA (Asserachrom VIII:Ag Kit; Diagnostica Stago) per the
manufacturer’s manual.
Tail tip bleeding assay
The efﬁcacy of TAK-754 was determined by measuring the total
blood
loss
in
mice,66
whereby
animals
were
anesthetized
(100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneally) and
2 mm of the tail tip was cut off. Blood was collected over an observa-
tion period of 60 min; blood loss was measured gravimetrically.

In vitro biopotency assay
TAK-754 biopotency was assessed in vitro using the human hepatic
cell line HepG2.46 After treatment of cells with 2 mM hydroxyurea
for 22 h, the cells were infected with AAV8-FVIII vectors in F17 me-
dium (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) containing 10 mg/mL von Wille-
brand factor (Baxalta) and 5 mM 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-Amiloride
(Sigma). During incubation (96 h), FVIII was expressed and released
into the cell supernatant. FVIII activity was determined by chromo-
genic endpoint measurement, as described for the in vivo FVIII bio-
potency assay. A reference curve of AAV8-FVIII vector material was
based on AAV8-ELISA titer.
Neutralizing BDD-FVIII antibody assay
The analysis was based on the Nijmegen modiﬁcation of the Bethesda
assay.67 Brieﬂy, the test sample was mixed with a test base (containing
BDD-rFVIII), and the loss in FVIII activity upon incubation was
measured. The relative loss in activity is correlated to the inhibitor
concentration in the sample; results are reported in Bethesda units
per milliliter.
Safety evaluation and biodistribution study in hemostatically
normal mice
Assessment of toxicity was based on clinical signs, body weight, food
consumption, ophthalmology, and clinical and anatomic pathology
evaluations. Complete necropsies were performed on ﬁve animals
from each cohort, with macroscopic abnormalities for all tissues, or-
gan weights, and microscopic examinations recorded. Tissues were
collected for biodistribution assessment from a further ﬁve animals
from each cohort. Blood was collected pre-dose and at necropsy
(n = 5) for FVIII activity, FVIII Ag, binding anti-BDD-FVIII anti-
bodies, neutralizing anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, and binding anti-
AAV8 antibodies.
Vector IS analysis
We used 25 mg of AAV-treated liver tissues for fully automated DNA
isolation using Qiagen spin columns on the QIAcube robotic system.
Vector copy numbers were determined by vector-speciﬁc qPCR. ISs
were analyzed using (nr) and standard LAM-PCR,68 which identiﬁes
genomic sequences ﬂanking the integrated AAV vector DNA. (nr)
LAM-PCR amplicons were sequenced after sample preparation on
a MiSeq instrument. Data were processed by (semi-) automated bio-
informatics data mining.
Statistical methods
Graphs and statistical analyses were created with GraphPad Prism 6
software. Student’s t test, one-way or two-way ANOVA, followed by
Holm-Sidak post hoc test was used for the statistical analysis as
appropriate. Values are presented as the mean ± SEM, and p < 0.05
was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
