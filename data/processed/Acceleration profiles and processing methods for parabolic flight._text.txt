Parabolic ﬂights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to “weightless” or reduced gravity conditions, facilitating research and
validation activities that complement infrequent and costly access to space. Although parabolic ﬂights have been conducted for
decades, reference acceleration proﬁles and processing methods are not widely available. Here we present a solution for collecting,
analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during parabolic ﬂights, which we validated during a
Boeing 727-200F ﬂight with 20 parabolas. All data and analysis code are freely available. Our solution can be integrated with diverse
experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer orientation, and allows unsupervised classiﬁcation of all phases of
ﬂight, providing a consistent and open-source approach to quantifying gravito-inertial accelerations (GIA), or g levels. As academic,
governmental, and commercial use of space advances, data availability and validated processing methods will enable better
planning, execution, and analysis of parabolic ﬂight experiments, and thus facilitate future space activities.

INTRODUCTION
Parabolic ﬂights are cost-effective, ground-based analogs that
achieve variable g (Earth-relative GIA) level environments that
recreate conditions experienced during space ﬂight.1,2 Specialized
aircraft can maintain approximately 20–30 s of a 0 g, freefall
environment before an increased GIA recovery phase (Fig. 1a).
Modiﬁed trajectories can achieve reduced g levels experienced on
the lunar surface or on Mars (0.17 and 0.38 g, respectively).
Parabolic ﬂights serve as valuable proving grounds for experi-
mental efforts
to maximize the
research
potential
of the
International Space Station3,4 and to accommodate increasing
interest in commercial space ﬂight.5,6
Here we address the limited availability of open access
acceleration datasets containing parabolic ﬂight proﬁles and
enable unsupervised and precise characterization of timing and
g levels for all ﬂight phases. We demonstrate this approach using a
small (65 g) battery powered commercially available acceler-
ometer and vibration measurement system. Together, these tools
and products reﬂect a comprehensive solution for experiment
planning, execution, and analysis of g level and vibrations during
parabolic ﬂight.
RESULTS
Flight operations were conducted on November 17, 2017 onboard
a Boeing 727-200F aircraft (G-Force One®, Zero Gravity Corpora-
tion). Four sets of parabolas were performed with 5, 6, 4, and 5
parabolas, respectively. The ﬁrst set targeted, in order, Mars g,
Mars g, Lunar g, 0 g, and 0 g. All other parabolas targeted 0 g. Data
were collected for 1.77 h during all phases of ﬂight from a Slam
Stick X™(Mide Technology Corp.) mounted in the rear of the
research section (Fig. 1b-c). Direct Current (DC) acceleration was
recorded at 411 Hz. Additional data, calibration, and calibration
error ( < 2%) assessment are described in Methods.
In any given experiment, one accelerometer orientation may be
more appropriate than another. Thus, our phase of ﬂight
identiﬁcation is based on a metric that is independent of
accelerometer orientation: the Euclidean norm of the acceler-
ometer (x,y,z) axes, which we refer to as g level or g (Methods).
To facilitate our analysis (Fig. 1d, Methods, Supplementary Figs.
1-5), acceleration data were ﬁltered (Fig. 1e) using a zero-delay,
low-pass ﬁlter prior to parabola identiﬁcation using change point
detection.7,8 Conceptually, this process ﬁnds the point for which a
statistical property (e.g., mean), has minimum total residual error
summed across two groups, e.g., before and after the change
point. Here residual error is the difference between an observed
value and the statistical property for the group.
Change point detection was ﬁrst applied to the ﬁltered g level,
gﬁlt, to identify differences in mean g levels in an unsupervised
manner (Fig. 1f). To break down the ﬂight into regions of stable g
levels, data within 10 s of each change point was subjected to
secondary change point detection using a linear slope metric,
which segmented the ﬂight into regions of rapid “transition”
(indicated by dotted lines, Fig. 1g-i) and more stable regimes. Non-
transition periods were subsequently classiﬁed into “parabola,”
“hypergravity,” and “other” based on their duration and g level
(Fig. 2a-b; Methods). These “hypergravity” periods result from
entry into and exit from the “parabola” periods.
DISCUSSION
Parabolic ﬂights provide the opportunity to perform simulated
space research in a cost-effective manner. Recently, Lambot and

Ord (2016) evaluated data from over 400 parabolic ﬂights and
assessed the quality of reduced g datasets.9 Although consider-
able effort was dedicated to identifying the highest quality, low g
time periods (with variations less than ± 0.01 g) from these ﬂights,
neither the acquisition hardware, the raw data, nor the code
implemented for analysis, are currently available to the public.
Indeed, when reviewing the literature, we found no such easily
accessible parabolic ﬂight acceleration data nor published analysis
methodology.
Here, we provide the following: (1) a commercially available
hardware solution for data acquisition; (2) raw and calibrated data
for all phases of ﬂight; (3) data analysis methodology that is
independent of accelerometer orientation, and (4) characteriza-
tion of g levels and durations achieved for 20 parabolas. In
addition, the code implementing our methodology to categorize
all phases of ﬂight and characterize g levels and durations of
parabolas is publicly available in order to facilitate future parabolic
ﬂight research. In addition, our methods could be adapted to
analysis of data from suborbital ﬂights, drop towers, or studies
involving launch and landing accelerations.
Our hardware solution, the Slam Stick X™, offers a compact,
ﬂexible, low-power, high resolution solution for acceleration and
vibration monitoring with favorable comparison to alternatives
(Methods). The small size facilitates integration into experiments
and measurement of the local GIA environment, which is not
constant across the aircraft. In addition, mounting with double-
sided tape is simple, robust, and does not impact the frequency
response (Methods).

Lambot and Ord9 identiﬁed a “sweet zone” in the middle of the
parabola with low acceleration deviation. Our data are consistent
with this conclusion (Supplementary Fig. 8), although Lambot and
Ord9 used, after unspeciﬁed low-pass ﬁltering, a much more
stringent tolerance (± 0.01 g) that was not met by our ﬁltered data.
We encourage future parabolic ﬂight experimenters to release raw
data as well as to provide data processing details (ideally including
in executable form) to facilitate validation and improvement of
processing algorithms, as well as reﬁne expected g levels and
support planning and analysis that can be tailored to speciﬁc
experimenter needs.
Due to the limited availability and high cost of actual space
environments, it is imperative that we continue to utilize parabolic
ﬂights as a means to simulate space – and to understand the
accuracy and limitations of this modality. By making our data and
methods available we hope to enable others to better plan,
execute, and analyze parabolic ﬂight experiments, and thus to
help facilitate future space activities.
METHODS
Device Selection
The Slam Stick X™(Mide Technology Corp., www.mide.com) was
selected based on its size (76 mm × 30 mm × 15 mm), low mass
(65 g), integrated battery, manual and USB interfaces, and
combination DC (Analog Devices ADXL345) and piezoelectric (TE
832M1) accelerometers to enable accuracy at both low (e.g., down
to 0 Hz) and high frequencies (up to 20 kHz sample frequency).
The aluminum body was selected to provide improved high
frequency
response.
Additional
integrated
sensors
included
temperature and pressure (NXP MPL3115) and control pad
temperature and pressure (TE MS8607).
Alternative data acquisition systems include many commercial
off the shelf (COTS) accelerometers, as well as the NASA Suborbital
Flight Environment Monitor (SFEM)9. There may be potential
beneﬁts of using the SFEM, although the Slam Stick X™offers
comparable or longer recording time, DC and piezoelectric
accelerometers (enabling both g level and high frequency
vibration measurements), higher sampling frequencies, a wider
operating temperature range (−40 °C to + 80˚C) and much lower
( > 10 × ) mass and volume. Another COTS option is the Lansmont
3X90 , although the Slam Stick X™speciﬁcations provide beneﬁts
in several areas (size, mass, sampling rates, and temperature
range).
One consideration for parabolic ﬂight experiments is that the
GIA environment is not constant across the aircraft. In some cases,
it may be adequate to have a single reference ﬂight proﬁle to be
used by multiple experiment teams. However, some applications
may be better served through measurement of the local GIA
environment of a given experimental apparatus. Here, the small
size of our solution facilitates direct incorporation into a payload,
as well as placement in the desired location or orientation.
When selecting a data acquisition solution, it is also important
to consider how the mounting of the accelerometer itself may
impact the frequency response; in our case, use of double-sided
sticky tape represents both an extremely practical and low bias
option, enabled by the low device mass. Because no additional
materials separate the accelerometer from the aircraft, there is no
need to correct for the frequency response of the mounting
interface.
Device mounting and data acquisition
Zero Gravity Corporation (ZGC) utilizes a standard system of
mounting hardware to the aircraft structure consisting of a
baseplate (61 cm × 61 cm × 1.27 cm aluminum plate, e.g., McMas-
ter Carr 86825K25) bolted to the aircraft structure using four
clearance holes at the corners of a square with 50.8 cm (20 in)
sides, centered on the baseplate. Washers (McMaster Carr
92503A230) were used for mounting in combination with AN-6
steel bolts (3/8 inch) provided by ZGC. The Slam Stick X™was
mounted to a standard baseplate with double-sided sticky tape
(3 M 950), which is the preferred mounting method due to its
vibration frequency response (near unity) and robustness: this
method has previously been validated during vibration testing at
over 75 g at 1 kHz1. The Slam Stick X™was conﬁgured using Slam
Stick Lab 1.8. Acquisition was initiated and terminated manually
using the control pad on the device. Sampling rates were 5 kHz
(piezoelectric vibration sensor), 411 Hz (DC acceleration), and 1 Hz
(pressure and temperature).
Data calibration
The raw IDE ﬁle generated by the Slam Stick X™was converted to
calibrated MAT (MATLAB, The Mathworks, Natick, MA) ﬁles using
the ide2csv.exe command line utility (Mide Technology Corp.)
using the factory calibration. Note that data calibration and export
functions can also be performed directly using Slam Stick Lab.
Here we focus on data from the DC accelerometer. We note that
temperature varied less than 1 °C and pressure showed a typical
regulated
proﬁle
and
was
highly
stable
during
parabolas
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
Orientation-independent approach
In any given experiment, one accelerometer orientation may be
more appropriate than another. Thus, we based our phase of ﬂight
identiﬁcation method (below) on a measure that is independent
of the accelerometer orientation: the Euclidean norm of the x, y,
and z axes, which we hereafter refer to as the g level or g. As this
variable is a positive scalar, it does not capture directional
ﬂuctuations in the gravity vector. Thus, for characterization of
phases of ﬂight, vector-based statistics should be used. For
example, we estimated the mean g level during a 0 g parabola by
averaging the x, y, and z components, and then computing the
norm.
Calibration veriﬁcation
The expected value of the g level is unity on Earth under non-
accelerated conditions; as a veriﬁcation of our accelerometer
calibration, we found the norm under lab bench conditions (14.2 s
recording) to be 0.9840 (rms) and 0.9840 ± 0.0055 (mean ± SD),
consistent with < 2% error. This is a lower bound when vibration
or speciﬁc force other than that caused by gravity is present,
consistent with the rms value (1.07) observed during ﬂight.
Speciﬁc force was concentrated in the z axis as measured by root
mean square (rms) values (0.0466, 0.0775, 1.0662 for x, y, and z
axes, respectively), consistent with the accelerometer orientation
(Fig. 1c). Calibration accuracy was also assessed after ﬁltering (see
below).
Phase of ﬂight characterization
For parabola identiﬁcation, we ﬁrst ﬁltered the raw data using a
zero-phase 12th order Butterworth ﬁlter using the designﬁlt()
function using a half power frequency (HPF) as described below.
Next, we utilized change point detection7,8 as implemented by the
MATLAB FindChangePts() function.
Change point detection was ﬁrst applied to the ﬁltered g level
gﬁlt to identify differences in mean g levels. A known number of
change points was speciﬁed based on the parabola number within
each set, e.g., two times the number of parabolas, plus two
additional transitions (ﬁrst pre-parabola pull up; last post-parabola
pull up) for each set of parabolas. In our case sets of 5, 6, 4, and 5
(20 total) parabolas become 12, 14, 10, and 12 change points. This
total
number
of
change
points
(48)
was
speciﬁed
and

FindChangePts() identiﬁed all g level change points in an
unsupervised manner (Fig. 1f).
We desire to break down the ﬂight into regions of stable g
levels. Thus, for each change point, we used a secondary change
point detection to identify differences in the slope of the g level
vs. time curves. Data within 10 s of each change point was
subjected to this secondary change point detection using a linear
slope metric. This step successfully segmented the ﬂight into
regions of rapid “transition” (indicated by dotted lines, Fig. 1g-i)
and more stable regimes. This resulted in 97 ﬂight periods (2 × the
number of change points + 1).
Classiﬁcation of non-“transition” ﬂight periods into “parabola,”
“hypergravity,” and “other” (which includes straight and level ﬂight
as well as standard rate turns) was then performed, ﬁrst by
categorizing any periods with duration > 100 s as “other”, then by
segmenting
data
according
to
g
level
(“parabola” ≤0.9 g,
0.9 < “other” ≤1.1 g, “hypergravity > 1.1 g). Despite its simplicity,
this classiﬁer achieved good separation between classes (Fig. 2a).
Parabola durations (mean ± s.d.) were 19.5 ± 1.4 s (0 g, N = 17,
range 17 to 24 s), 23.7 s (Lunar g; N = 1), and 28.9 ± 0.7 s (Mars g; N
= 2). The g levels achieved were 0.041 ± 0.005 g (0 g) and 0.159 g
(lunar g). Both Mars parabolas achieved 0.356 g, indicating high
consistency between parabolas targeting similar g levels. Higher g
levels were signiﬁcantly associated with longer-duration parabolas
(Supplementary Fig. 4a), although not when lunar and Mars data
were excluded (Supplemental Fig. 4b).
Some limitations are inherent in our study, which focused solely
on one ﬂight and 20 parabolas. If analyzing multiple ﬂights, with
parabolas performed under more varied conditions, it is possible a
slightly more complex classiﬁcation strategy might be required;
however, based on the wide separation between “parabola,”
“hypergravity,” and “other” classes, this is not expected to present
a signiﬁcant challenge to standard unsupervised classiﬁcation
approaches (e.g., k-means).
Filter optimization
To optimize the ﬁlter, we selected a HPF based on the g level
power spectral density (PSD, Supplementary Fig. 2a). The PSD was
computed
via
the
MATLAB
pwelch()
function
with
default
parameters. To select the HPF, we examined the cumulative sum
of the PSD (Supplementary Fig. 2b), which revealed a sharp
increase in power above 0.01 Hz. We chose this value (HPF =
0.01 Hz) to maximize the low frequency content of the ﬁltered
data while rejecting as much spectral power from higher
frequencies as possible. As an example, ﬁltering at HPF = 0.01 Hz
preserves parabola dynamics, whereas ﬁltering at HPF = 0.001 Hz
does not (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Our selected value provides the
smoothest data for identifying parabolas, while still accurately
representing g level transitions. A manual procedure identiﬁed
similar values, e.g., adjusting the HPF toward DC until the rapid
transitions between g levels showed systematic bias, then setting
the HPF to 10 × this value, also gave HPF = 0.01 Hz.
Filtering reduced the root mean square speciﬁc force in the
lateral (x) direction but little in other directions (0.0161, 0.0681,
1.0623 for x, y, z, respectively), consistent with low frequency
aircraft accelerations mainly due to pitch maneuvers. The g level
was near unity during periods of relative calm (Supplemental Fig.
3a-b), including the ﬁrst 1000 s of data collected during largely
straight and level ﬂight (rms 0.9919 and 0.9856, raw and ﬁltered,
respectively). This unﬁltered estimate is 0.8% higher than under
lab bench conditions, and both are consistent with accurate
sensor calibration at DC to lower than 2% error, based on the
factory calibration.
Regression analysis
Regression of parabola g level on duration was performed using
the MATLAB ﬁtlm() function. Conﬁdence intervals were deter-
mined using the MATLAB coefCI() function.
