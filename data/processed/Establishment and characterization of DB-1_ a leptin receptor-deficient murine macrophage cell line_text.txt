Abstract
Metabolic and immune mediators activate
many of the same signal transduction pathways.
Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often
affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that
exempliﬁes this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major
nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in
immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool
to investigate the link between leptin and innate
immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin
receptor-deﬁcient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The
cell line was created using bone marrow cells from
leptin receptor-deﬁcient mice. Bone marrow cells
were differentiated into macrophages by culturing
them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony
stimulating factor, and passaged when conﬂuent for
6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at
approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by
limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The
macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear
rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau.
The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have
phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages
from wild-type and leptin receptor-deﬁcient mice.
DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with
interferon-c as measured by increase in Nos2 tran-
script levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not
responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte
conditioned media nor leptin when compared to
primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1
cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of
leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated
inﬂammation and immune system dysregulation.

Introduction
Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a 16 kDa peptide
hormone predominantly secreted by white adipocytes
(Ahima and Flier 2000; Zhang et al. 1994). Leptin is
structurally similar to type I cytokines and referred to
as an adipokine or adipocytokine (Otero et al. 2005).
Leptin signals through its receptor (LepR) encoded by
the Lepr gene (Chen et al. 1996). The LepR exists in
six alternatively spliced isoforms (Lee et al. 1996).
The long isoform of LepR is a member of the
interleukin-6 receptor family of class 1 cytokine
receptors, and is responsible for most of leptin’s

physiological activities (Baumann et al. 1996; Tarta-
glia et al. 1995).
Leptin is involved in a plethora of physiological
actions, and plays a major role in the regulation of
neuroendocrine function and energy homeostasis
(Chan et al. 2003). Leptin stimulates the production
of anorectic neuropeptides and suppresses the action
of orexigenic peptides in the arcuate nucleus of the
hypothalamus (Cheung et al. 1997; Schwartz et al.
1997; Thornton et al. 1997), where LepR is highly
expressed (Elmquist et al. 1998). In addition, leptin
exerts other physiological effects that impact repro-
duction, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and immunity
(Wauters et al. 2000). Leptin’s effects are exerted
through the expression of LepR on different types of
tissues and cells throughout the body; these are often
referred to as leptin’s peripheral effects. Furthermore,
leptin plays an important role in the regulation of both
innate and adaptive immunity (La Cava and Matarese
2004; Matarese et al. 2005), and different immune
cells express LepR, which supports the notion that
leptin plays a direct role in immune function (Matarese
et al. 2005). T-cells (Batra et al. 2009), B-cells
(Papathanassoglou et al. 2006), neutrophils (Caldeﬁe-
Chezet et al. 2003), monocytes (Raso et al. 2002),
dendritic cells (Mattioli et al. 2005) and NK cells (Tian
et al. 2002) all express LepR, and leptin has been
shown to modulate their functions in vivo and in vitro
(Papathanassoglou et al. 2006).
Leptin induces diapedesis of monocytes and mac-
rophages through an epithelial layer in vitro and the
production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines from both
cell types (Curat et al. 2004; Gruen et al. 2007). In
macrophages, leptin augments LPS-induced cytokine
secretion (Gainsford et al. 1996; Loffreda et al. 1998)
via IRAK-1 up-regulation, (Vaughan and Li 2010) and
potentiates IFN-c-induced expression of nitric oxide
synthase (Raso et al. 2002).
Non-genetic obesity is characterized by a hyper-
leptinemic state (Considine et al. 1996) and a
compromised immune system (Falagas and Kompoti
2006). In addition, there is increased pro-inﬂammatory
macrophage recruitment in the adipose tissue of obese
individuals (Weisberg et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003), and
‘‘obese’’ macrophages have impaired phagocytic
activity (Krishnan et al. 1982; Mancuso et al. 2002).
It remains unclear what promotes a proinﬂamma-
tory state in obese animals and people and their higher
susceptibility to infections. Our central hypothesis is
that leptin contributes directly to this problem by
regulating macrophage function. Our objective here
was to create a continuous macrophage cell line to
allow for investigation of LepR’s impact on macro-
phage function. We detail the properties of this new
leptin receptor-deﬁcient macrophage cell line, DB-1 in
this paper.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male leptin receptor-deﬁcient (db/db) mice as well as
gender- and aged-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6
mice controls were purchased from Jackson Labora-
tories (Bar Harbor, ME). All animal procedures were
performed with prior approval and regular monitoring
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) at Kansas State University.
Reagents
Biomedium was prepared using Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Atlanta Biologicals, Law-
erenceville, GA, USA) supplemented with 5 % Nu
Serum (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford,
MA, USA), 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta
Biologicals), 10 % Opti-MEM reduced Serum Med-
ium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 50 lg per ml
gentamicin (Atlanta Biologicals; DMEM10) and
1.5 ng per ml recombinant mouse M-CSF (rmM-
CSF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Cell
culture medium was prepared using DMEM supple-
mented with 10 % Opti-MEM, 15 mmol/L HEPES
and 100 lg per ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant mouse leptin (rm-
leptin) and IFN-c were purchased from R&D Systems
Inc. Fluorescent spheres were purchased from Invit-
rogen. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma-
Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration
of 1 mg/ml and aliquoted at 10 lg/ml concentrations
and stored at -80 C. Cells were stimulated with
10 ll of freshly thawed aliquots.
Collection of peritoneal macrophages
Peritoneal exudate macrophages from WT and db/db
mice were induced by i.p. injection of 1.5 ml of sterile,
922

123

2.9 % thioglycollate (DIFCO, Detroit, MI, USA).
Four days after injection, mice were anesthetized via
isoﬂurane (IsoFlo, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA)
inhalation and euthanized via cervical dislocation.
Peritoneal exudate macrophages were collected by
washing the peritoneal cavity twice with 12 ml of ice-
cold PBS.
Differentiation of Bone Marrow Derived
Macrophages
Bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deﬁcient mice
(db/db) were collected by ﬂushing the humeri, tibiae
and femora as previously described (Armstrong et al.
1993). The undifferentiated cells were resuspended in
biomedium containing rmM-CSF (Metcalf et al.
1982), needed for macrophage differentiation, counted
and plated at a density of 3–5 9 106 cells per 100-mm
dish. Cells were incubated at 37 C in 8 % CO2 and
non-adherent cells were removed. Cells were adherent
and were dispersed with trypsin/EDTA (10 % trypsin,
0.1 mM Na2EDTA; Atlanta Biologicals) to passage
the cells. Cells were passed twenty times until
spontaneous
immortalization
occurred
as
was
described previously (Beharka et al. 1998). For
activation and phagocytosis assays, bone marrow cells
from db/db and WT mice, and for cytokine assays
bone marrow WT mouse cells were allowed to mature
for 7–10 days in biomedium before primary macro-
phages were used.
Limiting dilution cloning of cell lines
Cells were dispersed with trypsin/EDTA as described
above and resuspended in DMEM10. Cells were
counted and each dilution was plated in 48 wells of a
Costar 96-well, ﬂat-bottom tissue culture plate. A 1:10
serial dilution scheme was used starting at 100 cells/
well in 100 ll DMEM10 and ending at 0.01 cell/well.
Cells were then incubated at 37 C in 8 % CO2. Only
clones that grew from dilutions having less than a
30 % positive growth were selected and expanded.
The limiting dilution was repeated twice to ensure
pure clones. Two ﬁnal clones were selected and
characterization experiments were performed using
these clones. The cells were conﬁrmed to be of mouse
origin by positive PCR of mouse Actb gene and the
positive staining of the cells for mouse-speciﬁc MAC2
antigens between July and August 2009.
Genotyping of cell line
Transcript expression of the long isoform (LepR) of the
Lepr gene (NCBI 16847) was assessed using qRT-PCR
and the following primers: Lepr forward 50-GCA ACC
CAC CAT GAT TTC ACC ACA-30; reverse 30-AGG
ATT CCT GCC TCA CCA GTC AAA-50. The internal
control gene used was b-actin (NCBI number 11461)
with the following primers: Actb forward, 50-TGT GAT
GGT GGG AAT GGG TCA GAA-30; Actb reverse,
30-TGT GGT GCC AGA TCT TCT CCA TGT-50. Fold
change in transcript level of each cell type was quantiﬁed
using the method described by Pfafﬂ(2001), and the
formula using WT macrophages as the reference group:
Fold change ¼EDct target gene reference exp

where E is the efﬁciency of the primers, and the
housekeeping gene is ActB (encodes for b-actin).
Cell cycle determination
Cell cycle determination and ploidy of the cell line was
determined using ﬂow cytometry. Brieﬂy, cells in
culture were dispersed, collected and counted. A total
of 2 9 106 cells were transferred to 12 9 75-mm
polystyrene tubes (Falcon, Brookings, SD, USA).
Vindelov’s propidium iodide (PI) solution was added
andcellswereincubatedfor5–10 minat4 C(Vindelov
et al. 1983). Ploidy analysis was analyzed with singlet
discrimination to detect PI-stained mononuclear cells.
Assessment of cell growth
Cell growth of the leptin receptor-deﬁcient macro-
phage cell line, DB-1, was determined by counting the
cells. DB-1 cells were seeded (5 9 105 cells/well) in
6-well plates. At each time point, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days)
the medium was aspirated from three plates and the
cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA. Live cells
were assessed by trypan blue exclusion and counted on
a hemacytometer.

with antibodies speciﬁc for the following surface
markers: CD11b, F4/80, MAC-2, Ly6G (e-Biosci-
ence, San Diego, CA, USA) and Ly6C (BD Pharm-
igen, San Diego, CA, USA) after culture for at least
24 h. Appropriate isotype controls were used for each
antibody as the negative control for FACS analysis.
Brieﬂy, macrophages were recovered and plated at
1 9 105 cells per well of 96-well tissue culture plates.
Fc receptors were blocked by incubating the cells with
50 % goat serum (Atlanta Biologicals) in PBS for
30 min at 4 C. Antibodies and respective isotype
controls were added at the appropriate concentrations
and incubated for 1 h at 4 C. Cells were washed twice
with Hank’s buffered salt solution (HBSS). Cells were
transferred to 12 9 75-mm polystyrene tubes (Fal-
con), washed once with HBSS and resuspended in
200 ll of 1 % formalin/HBSS. The cells were placed
on ice and amount of staining of each marker was
assessed by ﬂow cytometry using a FACS Calibur
analytical ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickson, San Jose,
CA, USA) measuring 5,000 events per sample. Data
analysis was performed with WinList software (Verity
Software House, Topsham, ME, USA). The amount of
staining of each marker was assessed after subtracting
the percent positively stained cells in the isotype
control groups.
Giemsa staining of metaphase chromosomes
5 9 106 DB-1 cells were allowed to attach for 8 h in a
100-mm tissue culture plate. Cells were washed and
incubated with 10 lg/ml of colchicine (Colcemid,
GIBCO-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA)
overnight. Cells were dispersed with trypsin/EDTA as
described above, added to 5 ml of PBS and were
centrifuged at 3509g for 5 min. PBS was removed
and the pellet was loosened by gently ﬂicking the base
of the tube and 2 ml of freshly made 0.l M KCL were
added to the loosened pellet in a drop-by-drop fashion.
Two additional ml of 0.1 M KCL were added and the
cells were incubated at 37 C for 25 min. Cells were
ﬁxed with methanol and acetic acid (3:1) by adding 10
drops of ﬁxative (room temperature) to the cell
suspension and incubating at 23 C for 10 min. Cells
were gently pelleted at 3009g for 5 min and 2 ml of
ﬁxative were added to the cells. Cells were resus-
pended in ﬁxative and were immediately dropped onto
tilted glass slides 3–6 drops per slide to optimize cell
spreads. Slides were air dried and stained with a 1:50
dilution of Giemsa stain (KaryoMax Giemsa Stain,
GIBCO-Life Technologies). Slides were washed by
sequential dipping in PBS and water. Cells were air
dried, mounted with permount (Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Fairlawn, NJ, USA) and viewed on a compound
microscope and imaged. 50 cells in apparent meta-
phase arrest were scored for chromosome number and
one representative cell was analyzed and presented.
Cytokine secretion
Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) using DB-1 macrophage supernatants. DB-
1 macrophages were seeded in a 24-well plate
(1 9 105 cells/well) and cells were stimulated with
IFN-c (10 U/ml) for 4 h and/or LPS (15 lg/ml)
overnight. Supernatants were then collected, centri-
fuged at 350g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and IL-6
cytokine concentrations were determined from freshly
collected supernatants.
Phagocytosis assays
Bone marrow-derived, peritoneal and DB-1 macro-
phages that were in culture for at least 24 h. were
dispersed with trypsin/EDTA, recovered, and 1 9 106
cells were seeded per well in 24-well tissue culture
plates. Cells were incubated at 37 C in 8 % CO2 for
2 h. Cytochalasin D from Zygosporium mansonii
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the negative control
plates to inhibit phagocytosis. These plates were
incubated at 4 C for 2 h to further inhibit phagocy-
tosis. Experimental plates were kept at 37 C. Red
ﬂuorescent beads (diameter, 0.2 lm; Invitrogen) were
added to each well to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 %.
Phagocytosis was stopped after 60 min by centrifug-
ing the 24-well plates at 3509g for 5 min, removing
the supernatant, and washing twice with PBS. The
cells were transferred to 12 9 75-mm polystyrene
tubes (Falcon), washed twice with PBS and resus-
pended in 200 ll of 1 % formalin/PBS. The cells were
placed on ice and phagocytosis was assessed by ﬂow
cytometry using a FACS Calibur analytical ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickson) and measuring 10,000
events per sample. The percentage of phagocytosis in
the experimental groups was assessed after subtracting
the percentage phagocytosis of the negative control
treatment group.

Activation of DB-1 with rm-IFNc
To determine whether DB-1 macrophages respond to
IFN-c in the same fashion as primary macrophages,
the DB-1 cells were stimulated with IFN-c, and
expression of nos2 was assessed using qRT-PCR.
Brieﬂy, primary WT, db/db and DB-1 macrophages
were plated separately in 24-well plates at a density of
1 9 106 cells per well and incubated with or without
IFN-c (100 U/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA) for 16 h. RNA was collected using TRI reagent
(MRC, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and further puriﬁed with
DNAse using the E.Z.N.A Total RNA kit (Omega Bio-
Tek, Norcross, GA, USA). Gene expression of nos2
(NCBI number 18126) was quantiﬁed using qRT-PCR
with the following primers: nos2 forward, 50-CTG
CTG GTG GTG ACA AGC ACA TTT-30; nos2
reverse, 30-ATG TCA TGA GCA AAG GCG CAG
AAC-50. Actb was quantiﬁed using the previously
mentioned primers. Fold change in transcript level of
each cell type was quantiﬁed using the Pfafﬂmethod
(2001) as described above. For nitric oxide (nitrite
determinations), cells were incubated overnight in 0,
1, 10 and 100 U/ml of IFN-c. Nitrite concentrations
were determine in the supernatant 16 h. later as
described previously (Mordica et al. 2009).
Adipocyte collection and conditioned-medium
preparation
Adipocytes from epididymal and inguinal fat pads of
obese and lean male C57BL/6 mice were collected in
cell culture medium, pooled and minced into small
pieces. Tissue was digested in Krebs–Ringer Buffer
(KRB)
containing
1 mg/ml
type
II
collagenase
(Sigma-Aldrich) in an orbital shaker for 40 min at
37 C. The digested tissue was ﬁltered through nylon
cell strainers (100 lm; Fisher Scientiﬁc, Pittsburg,
PA, USA), washed with KRB, and separated by
centrifugation for 1 min at 3509g. The ﬂoating
adipocytes were collected and cultured in DMEM at
37 C, 8 % CO2 for 24 h. The adipocyte-conditioned
medium (ACM) containing all factors released by the
adipocytes was collected and used for migration
experiments with thioglycollate elicited peritoneal
and cell line DB-1 macrophages. Control medium
(CM) was obtained using the same protocol but
without adding adipocytes. Media were stored at
-80 C until use.
Migration assay
Wild-type peritoneal macrophages were collected as
described above and suspended in serum-free culture
medium. Cells were placed in the upper chamber of a
5 lm polystyrene ﬁlter (6-transwell format; Corning,
Lowell, MA, USA). Cells were left to adhere for 3 h;
at which point medium in the lower chamber was
replaced with either medium (CM, negative control),
CM supplemented with 10 ng/ml rm-leptin (ACM), or
CM supplemented with 2 lM phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA, positive control). After 3 h of
incubation, cells that had not migrated and remained
in the upper chamber were removed by gently swiping
the ﬁlters with cotton swabs. Filters were ﬁxed in 2 %
ethanol for 5 min. Cells located on the lower side of
the ﬁlter were stained with Diff-Quick (Dade Diag-
nostics, Aguada, PR, USA), and counted as migrated
cells. These cells were quantiﬁed from 5 to 10 ﬁelds/
condition and cell type.
Statistical analysis
Results are reported as mean ± standard deviation
(SD) unless otherwise speciﬁed. ANOVA analysis
was performed and least signiﬁcant differences (LSD)
were calculated when appropriate. Analysis was done
using SPSS software for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS
Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical signiﬁcance was
determined at p value\0.05.
Results
Establishment of DB-1 cell line
We established an immortal leptin receptor-deﬁcient
cell line from mouse bone marrow-derived macro-
phages. Bone marrow cells from leptin receptor
deﬁcient mice (db/db) were collected and cultured in
biomedium as described in the Materials and Methods
section. Differentiated macrophages were passaged at
conﬂuency. Cells were kept in biomedium for
6 months when the cells appeared to grow at a stable
rate after twenty passages. At that time, we did two
consecutive limiting dilution cloning procedures. The
DB-1 cells were selected from cloned cells from the
second cloning. DB-1 cells lost their dependency to

M-CSF during the cloning process. They were prop-
agated and shifted to a regular medium, DMEM
supplemented with 2 % Nu serum and 2 % FBS. DB-1
cells exhibit morphological properties characteristic
of macrophages, and are adherent with multiple
processes (Fig. 1). To conﬁrm the genotype of the
DB-1 cells as leptin-receptor deﬁcient, we used qRT-
PCR to conﬁrm the absence of LepR. Similarly to
primary peritoneal db/db macrophages, DB-1 had low
levels of Lepr transcripts, and expression ranged from
0.1 to 12 % of WT macrophages (p \ 0.05, Table 1).
To assess DB-1 ploidy and cell cycle distribution,
cell cycle analysis was done using ﬂow cytometry
(Vindelov et al. 1983). The DB-1 cell line was
homogenous consisting of diploid cells, of which
90–95 % cells were in G1 phase, 3–9 % in G2 phase
and 0–2 % in S phase (Fig. 2a, b). 50 metaphase-stage
cells (See Fig. 2c for an example) were analyzed for
chromosome number and 49 out of 50 cells examined
contained the normal complement of 38 chromosomes
with one X and one Y chromosome (Fig. 2d);
conﬁrming the origin of the cells from a male mouse.
DB-1 cell growth was determined and we found
that during the linear portion of the growth curve, an
average of 5.6 ± 1.1 9 105 cells were added to the
cell culture each day (Fig. 3). Cell growth plateaued
after 4–5 days and the cells became contact inhibited
and remained stable for as long as 3 weeks, which was
the longest we ran the experiment. The slow growth
rate along with the growth arrest at conﬂuency is

consistent with a cell line that is non-transformed and
contact inhibited (Schuler et al. 1977) but it is unclear
how these cells became immortalized. The fact that
most cells are in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is
consistent with the quiescent nature of the cells.
Detailed sequencing of the DB-1 cell genome will be
necessary to determine possible causes but these
analyses are beyond the scope of this study.
Cell surface phenotype
To verify that DB-1 cells were in the monocyte/
macrophage lineage, we compared their cell surface
molecule phenotype to primary peritoneal and bone
marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 4a, b). Primary
macrophages had similar levels of F4/80 and MAC-2,
regardless of their expression of LepR (Fig. 4b). Bone
marrow-derived macrophages had less expression of
CD11b and higher expression of Ly6C compared to
the peritoneal macrophages. All cell types, including
the DB-1 macrophages had minimal expression of

Ly6G, the granulocyte marker, on their surface. DB-1
macrophages displayed MAC-2 in similar amounts as
both bone marrow-derived and peritoneal WT and db/
db macrophages. In contrast, F4/80 was minimally
expressed and CD11b was not expressed at all in DB-1
macrophages. Ly6C was expressed by DB-1 macro-
phages at an intermediate level between that of the
bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages
(Fig. 4b). These data suggest that the DB-1 macro-
phages are in the macrophage lineage (Leenen et al.
1990) with high MAC2 expression, lower expression
of F4/80 and low levels of Ly6C (Geissmann et al.
2010).
Phagocytic activity
To assess whether DB-1 cells display functional
macrophage characteristics, we measured the phago-
cytic activity of DB-1 cells and compared this to that
of primary macrophages. We found that all ﬁve cell-
types—including the DB-1 macrophages—had simi-
lar phagocytic indices based on a 1-h phagocytosis
assay (Fig. 5, p [ 0.05).
DB-1 activation
To test whether DB-1 macrophages respond to a
stimulus in a similar fashion as primary macrophages,
DB-1 macrophages were stimulated with IFN-c and
transcript levels of Nos2 were quantiﬁed. We found
that Nos2 transcript levels were higher after IFN-c
treatment with levels similar to peritoneal db/db
macrophages (p \ 0.05, Table 2). Consistent with
transcriptional activation, they also secreted 15, 66
and 131 uM of nitrite in response to 1, 10 and 100 U/ml
of IFN-c, respectively. We also found that DB-1
macrophages
secreted
155 ± 48,
385 ± 38
and
538 ± 192 pg/ml
of
IL-6
in
response
to
LPS,
LPS ? IFNc or IFNc treatments, respectively, com-
pared to low (0 pg/ml) secretion by unstimulated cells.
Migration assay
To test whether DB-1 macrophages are responsive to
the chemotactic effect of adipocyte conditioned
medium or leptin, migration assays were performed
using both peritoneal WT and DB-1 macrophages. We
found that DB-1 macrophages were activated to
migrate when activated with 10 ll of PMA (10 lg/ml;
positive control, p \ 0.05), but that they failed to
respond to the chemotactic signals from the ACM as
well as the medium supplemented with leptin (Fig. 6).
On the other hand, primary WT macrophages had a
signiﬁcant increase in migration when cultured with
either the ACM or leptin (p \ 0.01; comparison to
medium alone) with no statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ence between the two media (p [ 0.05; Fig. 6);
suggesting that most of the ACM chemotactic
potential is mediated by leptin, and dependent on the
presence of a functional LepR.
Discussion
We created a leptin-receptor deﬁcient cell line, DB-1,
that has some phenotypic and functional properties
characteristic of primary macrophages. It is diploid,
has the normal complement of chromosomes, lacks the
long isoform of the leptin receptor, and is unrespon-
sive to leptin.
DB-1 cells are in the macrophage lineage based on
their selection in macrophage colony stimulating
factor over several months’ time and because of their

2, 4, 5 and 6, days after seeding of 5 9 105 DB-1 cells in 6-well
plates. Cells were counted as described in the ‘‘Materials and
methods’’ section. Each time point value is the mean of two
independent experiments ± SD, 3 replicates per experiment

phenotypic properties. Indeed, the DB-1 cells have
many of the characteristics of ex vivo bone marrow-
derived macrophages, thioglycollate-elicited perito-
neal WT and primary leptin receptor-deﬁcient macro-
phages, which the DB-1 cells are hoped to replace in
assays. However, their phenotypes are not completely
consistent with mouse bone marrow derived macro-
phages that have been differentiated for 7 days in
M-CSF (Leenen et al. 1994b). Although the DB-1
cells exhibit higher levels of MAC-2 expression and
lower levels of Ly6G, indicative of cells in the
macrophage lineage (Leenen et al. 1994a), the low

expression of F4/80, CD11b and Ly6C would indicate
that the cells may be less differentiated. Bone marrow-
derived, primary macrophages from LepR knock-out
mice had a phenotype similar to wild-type bone
marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macro-
phages. Therefore, it appears that in response to
M-CSF, the bone marrow stem cells began to differ-
entiate into macrophages. MAC2 was the ﬁrst of these
surface molecules to be expressed. Under normal
circumstances, the differentiating cells would go on to
express F4/80 and Ly6C by 7 days of stimulation with
M-CSF (See Fig. 7). DB-1 macrophages don’t appear
to have reached that stage. Macrophages that extrav-
asate into the peritoneal cavity lose expression of
Ly6C and go from low expression of CD11b to high
expression of the molecule. DB-1 also do not have that
phenotype; suggesting that DB-1 cells are early
differentiated macrophages (Chan et al. 1998; Geiss-
mann et al. 2010) (Fig. 7). This hypothesis is
supported by the observation that the DB-1 macro-
phages are responsive to IFN-c and LPS stimuli; a
property of macrophages (MacMicking et al. 1997).
The strong phagocytic activity of the DB-1 cells
supports that these cells are in the macrophage lineage
as well (Leenen et al. 1986). In our study, the LepR did
not appear to contribute to macrophage phagocytosis.
The lack of the leptin gene (Lep) as well as Lepr have
been associated with an enhanced susceptibility to
infections and a higher mortality rate in rodents
following bacterial infection (Ikejima et al. 2005;
Mancuso et al. 2002; Ordway et al. 2008; Park et al.
2009). This increased risk of infection has been
attributed to a decrease in phagocytic and bactericidal
activity of ob/ob and db/db macrophages in vitro
(Loffreda et al. 1998; Mancuso et al. 2002; Park et al.
2009). The difference in phagocytic activity between
our DB-1 macrophages and that of ob/ob and db/db
primary macrophages evaluated in other studies might
be explained by the fact that we used inert ﬂuorescent
beads in our study compared to actual infectious
agents (Loffreda et al. 1998; Mancuso et al. 2002; Park
et al. 2009). However, we found that DB-1 macro-
phages’s ability to phagocytose ﬂuorescent Ehrlichia
chaffeensis bacteria was comparable to that of primary
macrophages (data not shown). Therefore, the differ-
ence between our study and data presented by others

may be due to other physiological factors such as a
compromised oxidative response (Hsu et al. 2007) in
immune cells or inefﬁcient leukotriene production
(Mancuso et al. 2002); products that were compro-
mised in primary db/db and ob/ob macrophages. It is
also possible that physiological factors associated with
diabetes such as hyperglycemia may have an impact.
Park et al. (2009) showed similar infection rates in
mice between 8–11 week-old db/db mice and WT
controls but older (20 weeks and more) db/db mice
were signiﬁcantly more susceptible to S. aureus
infection. The DB-1 cells would not be subject to the
physiological regulation of the in vivo macrophages
because they are maintained in vitro.
Obesity is associated with an increase in inﬂam-
matory macrophage recruitment to the expanding fat
mass (Weisberg et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003). Studies
have recognized MCP-1 as the major adipocyte-
derived chemokine responsible for this effect (Kanda
et al. 2006; Weisberg et al. 2006). Nevertheless, recent
studies have questioned this chemokine’s role in the
enhanced recruitment of macrophages into the adipose
tissue of obese mice (Inouye et al. 2007). Leptin is
another candidate adipokine/chemokine that might be
responsible for this recruitment effect. Indeed, our
data show that ACM as well as leptin-supplemented
media have the same positive chemotactic effect on
WT macrophages. Our DB-1 cell line, which lacks the
functional LepR, failed to respond to both leptin-
supplemented as well as adipocyte-conditioned media
although our cell line responded to PMA. The
differences between the WT macrophages and the
DB-1 cells in their responsiveness to leptin can be
directly attributed to the absence of LepR on the DB-1
cells which supports the studies of Gruen et al. (2007),
who have shown leptin‘s chemotactic effects at levels
as low as 1 pg/ml and illustrates their value in
investigating the impact of the LepR in macrophage
function. In an era characterized by increasing obesity
rates (Ogden et al. 2006), it is of central importance
that the immunological consequences of excessive
body weight
be
further
elucidated.

established DB-1 cell line can serve as an important
and reliable tool to study the link between leptin and
innate immune function. For example, future studies
on the impact of LepR on antigen processing, cell
trafﬁcking or the recruitment of other inﬂammatory
cells can be done either in vitro or in vivo. Because the
cells are contact inhibited and do not appear to be
tumorigenic, we can envision adoptive transfer studies
similar to what were done with the C2D macrophage
cell line (Ortega et al. 2011; Xie et al. 2010). These
cells will be useful to any study investigating the role
of the leptin receptor in cell function.
