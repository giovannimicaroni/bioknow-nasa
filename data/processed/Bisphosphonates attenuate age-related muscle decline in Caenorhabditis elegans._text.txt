Abstract
Background
Age-related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of
life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals
could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the
efﬁcacy of bisphosphonates as an anti-sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.
Methods
Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM
zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microﬂuidic chip device. The ef-
fects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP-tagged myoﬁbres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post-
adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA-mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi
gene knockdown across the life-course.
Results
We found 100 nM and 1 μM ZA increased lifespan (P < 0.001) and healthspan [954 ± 53 (100 nM) and
963 ± 48 (1 μM) vs. 834 ± 59% (untreated) population activity AUC, P < 0.05]. 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan
(P < 0.0001) but not healthspan (758.9 ± 37 vs. 834 ± 59, P > 0.05), whereas 100 and 500 μM ZA were larval lethal.
ZA (1 μM) signiﬁcantly improved myoﬁbrillar structure on days 4 and 6 post-adulthood (83 and 71% well-organized
myoﬁbres, respectively, vs. 56 and 34% controls, P < 0.0001) and increased well-networked mitochondria at day 6
(47 vs. 16% in controls, P < 0.01). Genes required for ZA-mediated healthspan extension included fdps-1/FDPS-1
(278 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively,
P < 0.0001), daf-16/FOXO (680 ± 16 vs. 894 ± 17%, P < 0.01) and agxt-2/BAIBA (531 ± 23 vs. 552 ± 8%,
P > 0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through knockdown of igdb-1/FNDC5 (635 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10% population
activity AUC in gene knockdown vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01) and sir-2.3/SIRT-4 (586 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10%,
P < 0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA co-treatment vs. knockdown alone [651 ± 12 vs. 635 ± 10%
(igdb-1/FNDC5) and 583 ± 9 vs. 586 ± 10% (sir-2.3/SIRT-4), both P > 0.05]. Conversely, let-756/FGF21 and sir-
2.2/SIRT-4 were dispensable for ZA-induced healthspan [630 ± 6 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in
knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01 (let-756/FGF21) and 568 ± 9 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05 (sir-
2.2/SIRT-4)].
Conclusions
Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to im-
proved neuromuscular function across the life course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable
anti-sarcopenia therapy.

Introduction
Age-related muscle decline, termed ‘sarcopenia’, is classiﬁed
as a speciﬁc disease associated with numerous health risk fac-
tors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10% of older
populations1 and up to 31% as a co-morbidity.2 Despite asso-
ciated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions3 and
signiﬁcant impacts on individual quality of life and all-cause
mortality,4 efﬁcacious treatment strategies against sarcope-
nia remain limited.
Physical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the
most effective chronic modiﬁable lifestyle strategy against
sarcopenia.5 However, ageing muscle growth responses to
these interventions are sub-optimal,6 and certain older indi-
viduals can be unable (i.e., through injury and/or access to ex-
ercise facilities) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous
activity. Indeed, ~50–70% of those aged 75+ years are physi-
cally inactive,7 meaning complementary pharmaceutical ther-
apies are relevant to a signiﬁcant portion of the ageing pop-
ulation. Established drugs that modify human muscle ageing
are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display var-
iable
therapeutic
efﬁcacy
and
associate
with
harmful
side-effect proﬁles that render them inappropriate for
long-term clinical use. For example, rapamycin holds variable
efﬁcacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease8
but is a potent immunosuppressant9 unsuitable for chronic
use in otherwise healthy humans. Drug identiﬁcation efforts
might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically ap-
proved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic,
immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery.
Bisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of en-
dogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple
biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, including
muscle.10 Recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophos-
phate, bisphosphonates inhibit calciﬁcation and lower hy-
droxyapatite degradation,11 while also promoting osteoclast
apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. As such,
bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy
against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions.12
Yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably
linked:
Effective
mechanical
coupling
and
endocrine
muscle-bone communication is essential to muscle and bone
health,13 with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting
together.14 Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or
pamidronate (the most popular ﬁrst-line bisphosphonates)
for between 6 months and 3 years display signiﬁcant in-
creases in muscle strength15 and total muscle mass.16 Recent
reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid
(ZA), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass
in rodent models of cancer cachexia,17 Duchenne muscular
dystrophy18 and denervation-induced muscle atrophy.19 Ret-
rospective analysis of osteoporosis patients prescribed ZA
for 3 years also exhibit signiﬁcant increases in total lean mus-
cle mass, compared with a loss of muscle mass in untreated
controls.20 In the ageing context, ZA-treated fruit ﬂies
displayed increased survival and improved climbing ability
across the life course, suggesting improved neuromuscular
ageing.21 However, the direct anti-sarcopenic efﬁcacy of ZA
has not been established.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established
model of ageing, displaying ordered, progressive age-related
deterioration
of
multiple
tissues,
including
muscle.22
C. elegans muscle is also highly morphologically and metabol-
ically similar to human muscle and has high genetic orthology
(60–85%) of sub-muscular systems with people.23 As with
fruit ﬂies, C. elegans are invertebrates that do not possess
clear orthologues of mammalian bone secretory factors
(‘osteokines’).24 C. elegans are, therefore, an excellent
system for understanding muscle-speciﬁc mechanisms of
bisphosphonates,
independently
of
bone-derived
con-
founders. We thus employed C. elegans as a genomic model
of ageing muscle decline to establish the bone-independent
effects, and mechanisms of, bisphosphonates on sarcopenia
progression as part of an ageing drug translational pipeline
with realistic, near-term applicability in the clinic.
Methods
Assessing zoledronic acid effects on Caenorhabditis
elegans lifespan and healthspan
Wild-type (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by grav-
ity ﬂotation and ~80 L1 larvae were placed on 33 mm petri
dishes (20 L1 per 33 mm plate) containing 2 mL NGM agar
[50 mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) bacteriological peptone, 1.7%
(w/v) agar, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM KH2PO4
(pH 6), 12.9 μM cholesterol] and seeded with 200 μL of
OP50 Escherichia coli bacteria. For ZA treatments, 100 μL of
dilute compound (i.e. – 100 μL of 2.3 μM, 23 μM, 230 μM,
2.3 mM and 11.5 μM intermediate dilutions in ddH2O for
100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM and 500 μM concentrations,
respectively) were diluted into a 2.3 mL plate volume to
achieve the desired ﬁnal concentration. Control animals were
grown on plates seeded with 100 μL of ddH2O to account for
any diluting of bacterial lawns. Animals were grown on petri
dishes for ~48 h at 20°C to reach young adulthood, then
washed off using 3 mL M9 buffer (3 g KH2PO4, 6 g
Na2HPO4, 5 g NaCl, 1 mL 1 M MgSO4 per litre) and pooled
into 60 cm petri dishes. From these pooled samples, ~70
young adults were collected and loaded into microﬂuidic
chips (Inﬁnity chips; Nemalife Inc., TX) using a 2.5 mL syringe,
where the animals remained throughout the rest of the life
course. Using the Inﬁnity screening system (Nemalife Inc.,
TX), on every day of the life course, chips were washed for
90 s with liquid NGM to remove progeny followed by a fur-
ther 90 s recording for subsequent computational analysis

of animal survival and locomotion. Chips were then injected
with ~200 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 supplemented with ZA or
ddH2O. Speciﬁcally, 980 μL of 20 mg/mL OP50 was supple-
mented with 20 μL of the required ZA intermediate dilution
(i.e., 5 μM, 50 μM and 500 μM intermediates for 100 nM,
1 μM and 10 μM of ZA, respectively) or 20 μL of ddH2O for
controls. Chips were then stored in petri dishes at 20°C for
the next 24 h with a damp, sterile tissue and paraﬁlmed to
avoid the microﬂuidic arena drying out.
Lifespan was performed using the Inﬁnity system screening
platform (Nemalife Inc., TX). Speciﬁcally, 90 s videos were
split into three still image frames (frames 1, 300 and 900),
and the Inﬁnity screening system automates a bounding box
around every (~70–80) whole animal in the microﬂuidic chip.
Using the Inﬁnity system software (Nemalife Inc., TX), compu-
tational coefﬁcients determine animal displacements from
outside this bounding box and were used for both lifespan
and healthspan analysis. Animals were deemed dead if coef-
ﬁcients were <0.01 (no movement) and alive if values were
>0.01. For healthspan analysis, movement rate was em-
ployed as one of the most robust measures of animal
healthspan.25 For quantiﬁcation, animals that obtained coef-
ﬁcients of 0.01–0.40 (i.e., unable to move more than half its
body length between subsequent frames) were deemed inac-
tive. Animals with scores of 0.41–1 were classed as ‘active’
animals (i.e., moving half of, or more than its full body-length
in displacement between subsequent frames).
Both lifespan and healthspan were determined every day
using videos of microﬂuidic-housed populations. Average
values were taken from movement scores between all three
frames. In addition to software automation, each video was
manually corrected for any false positives/box deformations
that could skew movement scores. Daily mean movement
values were converted to area under the curve to denote to-
tal population movement scores across the entire life course.
Zoledronic acid effects on sarcopenia dystrophic
progression with age
The anti-sarcopenic effects of ZA (1 μM) was visualized and
quantiﬁed using transgenic strains expressing green ﬂuores-
cent protein (GFP)-tagged sarcomeres (PJ727 strain: jls01
(myo-3:: GFP, rol-6 (su1006)); unc-54::lacZ V) or GFP-tagged
mitochondria (CB5600 strain: ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3:: Ngfp-lacZ;
Pmyo-3:: Mtgfp) I; him-8 (e1489) IV). Strains were grown on
33 mm plates containing 2 mL NGM agar seeded with
200 μL of OP50 ± ZA, as detailed above. Animals were trans-
ferred onto fresh plates every 2 days after young adult stage
to remove progeny and prevent population starvation. To im-
age sarcomere and mitochondrial structure, ~30 animals per
condition/time point were picked into 20 μL of M9 buffer
on a microscope slide (VWR Superfrost, UK) with a cover slip
placed on top and imaged immediately using an upright
epiﬂourescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK).
Images of the body wall muscles were captured from
the head and tail region of each animal (avoiding the
mid-animal/vulva region that exhibits frequent egg-laying
induced
tissue
disruption)
using
an
Orca-spark
camera
(Hamamatsu, Japan) set to 50 ms exposure rate and a gain of
3.4 dB for all acquired images. Approximately 10 individual mus-
cle cells were scored per animal equating to ~300 muscle cells
per condition/replicate and scored as either well networked,
moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscle sarco-
mere or mitochondria structures as previously described26
(see Figure S1 for representative images of each class of
structural defect). Analysis was carried out in ImageJ, and the
number of well networked, moderately fragmented or severely
fragmented muscles were expressed as a percentage of total
muscle cells visible and analysed within each animal.
RNA interference and combined zoledronic acid
treatments for lifespan and healthspan analysis
The effects of RNAi treatments on animal lifespan/healthspan
were determined using bacterial feeding vectors and per-
formed in the Inﬁnity screening system, as described above.
All bacterial lawns expressing double-stranded RNA were
grown from the MRC Ahringer Library of bacterial clones to
target (fdps-1: R06C1.2; daf-16: R13H8.1; agxt-2: T09B4.8;
igdb-1: T04A11.3; let-756: C05D11.4; sir-2.2: F46G10.7: sir-
2.3: F46G10.3). Each clone was streaked onto LB plates sup-
plemented
with
50
μg/mL
ampicillin
and
25
μg/mL
carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37°C. Single colonies
were then picked into sterile LB broth supplemented with
50 μg/mL ampicillin and grown for 16 h with shaking at
180 rpm at 37°C. After 16 h incubation, 0.4 mM isopropyl
β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added for RNAi induction,
with further shaking at 180 rpm for 2 h at 37°C as described
previously.27 After 18 h incubation, tubes were spun at
3000 g for 10 min to obtain bacterial pellets. Liquid NGM
was added to each bacterial pellet to reach a ﬁnal bacteria
concentration of 20 mg/mL, adding isopropyl β-D-1-thio-
galactopyranoside to a ﬁnal 1 mM concentration before
use. For combined ZA treatments, the same bacterial prepa-
ration was performed, but with 20 μL of dilute ZA supple-
mented to 1 mL of 20 mg/mL OP50 in NGM for a ﬁnal con-
centration of 1 μM. On every day of the life course, after
washing/recording using the Inﬁnity system as detailed
above, ~200 μL of RNAi bacteria ± ZA (1 μM) was injected into
the microﬂuidic chips before storing in petri dishes at 20°C
for 24 h until washing/refeeding the next day (with drug
dilution/control). All bacteria and drug solutions were
prepared fresh daily until cessation of life. RNAi experiments
were always conducted alongside empty vector controls
(PL4440).

Statistics
Lifespan analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier curves
assessed
by
the
log-rank
(Mantell–Cox)
test.
Multiple
comparisons of survival curves were performed manually
using the Bonferroni-corrected threshold. For movement
rate, area under the curve (AUC) was performed on mean
movement values across each day of adulthood (averages
taken from across all three frames). AUC values and standard
deviations obtained from replicate screens were then
assessed by one-way ANOVA in GraphPad, Prism. Both mito-
chondrial and sarcomere quantiﬁcation were analysed by
two-way ANOVA using the percentage classiﬁcation score
from individual animals across biological repeats. All statistics
were performed in GraphPad, Prism (San Diego, California
USA).
Results
Zoledronic acid extends Caenorhabditis elegans
lifespan and healthspan
Higher ZA concentrations (500 and 100 μM) were larval le-
thal, and 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (median survival = 11
vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001; Figure 1A) without sig-
Figure 1 Zoledronic acid acts dose-dependently to improve C. elegans survival and movement capacity. (A) Animals exposed to 10 μM zoledronic acid
(ZA) exhibit signiﬁcant declines in survivability (top) to untreated controls (median survival: 10 vs. 14 days, respectively, P < 0.0001), however, show no
signiﬁcant impairment in movement capacity (bottom) across whole life (P = 0.208). Conversely, both 1 μM (B) and 100 nM (C) were beneﬁcial to an-
imal survival (1 μM median survival: 16 days, P < 0.001; 100 nM: 16 days, P < 0.0001), with paralleled improvements in movement capacity through-
out the life course. (D) Graphical overlay of lifespan curves from each ZA concentration versus untreated controls. (E) Overlay of life course movement

(median

doses
also
associated
with
healthspan extension at 1 μM (AUC = 963.1 ± 48.74,
P < 0.05; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (AUC = 953.8 ± 53.77,
P < 0.05; Figure 1C) treatments. Additionally, signiﬁcant
movement decline onset became apparent in day 9 control
animals (P > 0.01 vs. day 1 adults), which was upheld
across all ZA treatment doses at this single time point
(+22.2, +31.8 and +17.6% population activity on day 9 vs.
untreated controls in 10 μM, 1 μM and 100 nM, respec-
tively). ZA thus acts dose-dependently to augment animal
longevity and health across the life course.
Zoledronic acid delays age-related declines in
muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial integrity
To understand the effects of ZA on progressive sarcomere
dystrophy across age, transgenic C. elegans expressing
GFP-tagged myosin were treated with 1 μM ZA. Corroborat-
ing previous reports on the temporal age-related loss of
sub-cellular muscle structures,22 untreated wild-type animals
displayed a signiﬁcant 35.6% decline in organized myoﬁbril-
lar structure by day 4 post-adulthood (P < 0.0001; Figure 2A,
B), which worsened to 58.0% by day 6 post-adulthood
(P < 0.0001). ZA delayed loss of organized sarcomeres until
day 6 post-adulthood (15.6%, P < 0.01), and signiﬁcantly in-
creased the number of muscle cells displaying organized sar-
comeres versus untreated controls at days 4 (83.9% vs.
54.4%) and 6 (71.1% vs. 31.4%) post-adulthood (both
P < 0.0001, Figure 2A,B). ZA also decreased muscle cells cat-

Bisphosphonates in sarcopenia

egorized as ‘moderately disorganized’ on days 4 (17.0% vs.
38.2%, P < 0.01) and 6 (27.6 vs. 53.4%, P < 0.0001)
post-adulthood and reduced the number of ‘severely disorga-
nized’ muscles on day 6 post-adulthood (1.8% vs. 13.1%,
P < 0.0001).
We next examined the effects of ZA on mitochondrial in-
tegrity, given the strong associations of mitochondrial struc-
ture and function with ageing animal health. In line with pre-
vious
wild-type
ageing
studies,22
loss
of
networked
mitochondria occurred by day 2 post-adulthood (Figure S2),
which
progressively
worsened
at
day
4
(42.6%,
P
<
0.0001)
and
day
6
post-adulthood
(67.0%,
P < 0.0001; Figure 3A,B). ZA treatment did not delay the on-
set of well-networked mitochondria loss at day 2 (Figure S2)
or day 4 post-adulthood (51.8%, P < 0.0001). However, ZA
prevented progressive mitochondrial fragmentation at day 6
post-adulthood (46.7%, P > 0.05 vs. day 4), which was also
signiﬁcantly higher than in untreated animals (46.7 vs.
16.1%, P < 0.01).
Zoledronic acid-mediated healthspan extension
acts through multiple mechanisms
The lifespan extending effects of ZA have previously been at-
tributed to the mevalonate cholesterol/isoprenoid lipid bio-
synthesis pathway and the FOXO family of transcription
factors,21 but their role in ZA-induced healthspan extension
is unknown. RNAi knockdown (KD) of fdps-1, an orthologue
of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase involved in the biosynthe-
sis of farnesyl diphosphate intermediates from mevalonate,
impaired survival (median survival = 6 vs. 14 days for controls,
P < 0.0001) and healthspan (AUC = 287 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% pop-
ulation activity for controls, P < 0.0001), which was not im-
proved by co-treatment with 1 μM ZA (Figure 4A). Similarly,
RNAi KD of the daf-16/FOXO stress response pathway im-
paired survivability (median survival = 12 vs. 14 days for con-
trols, P < 0.0001) and healthspan (AUC = 680.5 ± 23.6 vs.
894.2 ± 17.4 for empty vector, P < 0.01) and prevented the
beneﬁcial effects of ZA treatment (Figure 4B).
Figure 3 Zoledronic acid attenuates age-related loss of muscle mitochondrial structure. (A) Untreated animals displayed progressive declines in
well-networked mitochondria across days 0, 4 and 6 post-adulthood (for each time point, P < 0.0001). Zoledronic acid treatment (1 μM) animals
saw a similar decline by day 4; however, no further decline was evident by day 6 post-adulthood, showing signiﬁcant improvement when compared
to untreated animals at this time point (P < 0.01). (B) Representative images of untreated (top) and zoledronic acid treated (bottom) data are means
of two biological repeats with ~50–60 animals per condition/time point, and images taken from head and tail regions of each animal (~120–150 muscle
cells per condition/time point). Asterisks denote signiﬁcance between zoledronic acid and untreated animals within each structural category
(**P < 0.01). ‘¥’ denotes signiﬁcant loss of myoﬁbrillar structure for within-condition comparisons versus day 0 values (¥¥¥¥P < 0.0001).

The FOXO pathway is a global stress response system, in-
ducible by a wide array of stimuli and a generic transcription
factor regulating cellular responses across multiple drug
families28 that integrates multiple upstream signals to inﬂu-
ence worm ageing.29 Alternative, muscle-centric mechanisms
thus also likely contribute to the healthspan beneﬁts of ZA.
To
probe
potential
muscle-derived
mechanisms
of
ZA-induced healthspan extension, we examined the role of
three putative myokines that exhibit altered expression
across age and implicated in muscle-bone crosstalk: agxt-2/
BAIBA, igdb-1/FNDC5 and let-756/FGF21.24 Lifespan and
healthspan
were
unaffected
by
KD
of
agxt-2/BAIBA
(β-aminoisobutyric acid), a muscle-borne bone protective
factor30; however, combined agxt-2 KD with ZA treatment
was unable to confer life/healthspan extension (Figure 4C).
Conversely, the inhibition of igdb-1 extended lifespan (me-
dian survival = 11 vs. 7 days for controls, P < 0.05) and im-
proved healthspan (AUC = 634.5 ± 10.5 vs. 523 ± 10.0 for con-
trols, P < 0.01), with similar life/healthspan extension
observed upon co-treatment with ZA (Figure 5A). Addition-
ally, let-756 appears dispensable for ZA-induced healthspan
effects: KD alone caused no signiﬁcant alterations in survival
or movement, whereas increased lifespan and healthspan
was retained with combined let-756 KD and ZA treatment
(Figure 5B).
Recent rodent work shows bisphosphonates attenuate
denervation-induced muscle atrophy via downregulation of
sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), one of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-
tide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase family members.19 Be-
cause SIRT3 is primarily mitochondrially localized,31 we exam-
ined the role of two C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuins, sir-2.2
and sir-2.3,32 for their role in ZA-mediated lifespan and
healthspan extension. Reinforcing a mitochondrial role of
sir-2.2 and sir-2.3, RNAi KD of each gene caused increased mi-
tochondrial fragmentation at day 0 post-adulthood (Figure
S3). While sir-2.2 KD did not alter animal survival or
healthspan, loss of sir-2.2 blocked ZA’s life extending proper-
ties but ZA-induced healthspan extension remained (Figure
5C). Additionally, and in line with previous reports in
C. elegans,33 we ﬁnd that knockdown of sir-2.3 extends
lifespan (Figure 5D) and healthspan (Figure 5H), which re-
mains with combined ZA treatment but is not synergistically
beneﬁcial.
Discussion
Despite the socio-economic implications, treatment options
for sarcopenia remain mostly limited to modiﬁable lifestyle
changes such as diet and exercise, which are incompletely
effective.34 Complementary drug interventions would, there-
fore, beneﬁt a signiﬁcant portion of the ageing population,
yet effectual compounds that are safe for long-term
use remain elusive. Identifying drugs in clinical use and
repurposing for sarcopenia indications could provide immedi-
Figure 4 FDPS, FOXO and BAIBA orthologues are required for the healthspan effects of zoledronic acid. Knockdown of FDPS-1 (FDPS) with ZA
co-treatment (1 μM) prevents ZA mediated lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) extension (A). Similarly, knockdown of daf-16 (FOXO) decreases
survival and movement, with no improvement with ZA co-treatment (B). The conserved bone-muscle ortholog agxt-2 (BAIBA) is required for ZA me-
diated improvement in survival and movement (C). Data are mean + SD of two repeats, with ~140–160 animals per condition/time point. Asterisks

ately exploitable pharmaceuticals for the general population.
Bisphosphonates have been used to safely treat osteoporosis
for decades.35 Here, we report that bisphosphonates (ZA) ex-
tend C. elegans lifespan and healthspan, which associates with
delayed onset of muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial de-
cline. While general stress response pathways, such as FOXO,
regulate these positive healthspan responses to ZA, we estab-
lish muscle-centric myokines (agxt-2 and igdb-1) and mito-
chondrial sirtuin (sir-2.3) as previously unknown regulators
of bisphosphonate effects on ageing muscle health.
Growing pre-clinical17–19 and human20 evidence suggest
that bisphosphonates not only preserve bone integrity but
also exert muscle promoting effects across a variety of condi-
tions. A recent study in fruit ﬂies suggest similar effects might
extend to the ageing process, where bisphosphonate treat-
ment prolonged lifespan and animal healthspan.21 We pro-
vide the ﬁrst in vivo evidence for a direct role of chronic bis-
phosphonate administration in delaying age-related muscle
structural decline. Because ageing muscle architectural alter-
ations are a hallmark of human sarcopenia that relate to
lowered motility in animals,22 bisphosphonate-mediated sar-
comere preservation could translate to reduced sarcopenia in
higher animals and people. ZA also attenuated ageing muscle
mitochondrial decline. Mitochondrial health is strongly linked
with sarcopenic progression across species and mitochondrial
structure corresponds with oxidative function23; therefore,
bisphosphonates might hold dual, and possibly interrelated,
efﬁcacy for maintaining muscle metabolic health and sarco-
meric integrity. While we assessed animals at, and beyond,
the point of onset of age-related sub-muscular decline, the
anti-sarcopenic efﬁcacy of bisphosphonates into very old
age remains to be determined. Nonetheless, using our micro-
ﬂuidic healthspan device27 and animal movement rate as a
robust index of health,25 we demonstrate that early- to
mid-life muscle preservation translates to improved animal
health across the entire life course. Bisphosphonates thus
represent a promising strategy for maintaining muscle, and
whole animal health into older age.
In fruit ﬂies, bisphosphonates increase lifespan through
inhibition
of
the
mevalonate
metabolic
pathway
and
downstream
FOXO
activation.21
We
extend
this
by
implicating the mevalonate-FOXO system as necessary for
bisphosphonate-mediated health improvements across the
life course. The sterol and non-sterol isoprenoids synthesized
via mevalonate localize to plasma membranes and inﬂuence
several vital cellular processes, the dysfunction of which asso-
ciate with wide ranging pathologies including cardiovascular
disease,
autoimmune
disease,
cancer
and
Alzheimer’s
disease.36 Our data suggest that sarcopenia can be added to
this list, whereby knockdown of a key enzyme in mevalonate
metabolism, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (fdps-1), allows
normal larval development to adulthood and young adult
(day 1) movement rates, corroborating earlier reports of nor-
mal L4 larvae muscle architecture upon fdps-1 RNAi.37 There-
after, downregulation of fdps-1 causes rapid neuromuscular
functional decline (i.e., animal motility), likely indicative of
accelerated sarcopenia. Because zoledronic acid is unable
to improve lifespan and healthspan in fdps-1 or daf-16
Figure 5 Genes either dispensable, or that associate with ZA’s healthspan effects. Knockdown of igdb-1 (FNDC5) signiﬁcantly increased survival and
healthspan, where ZA co-treatment (1 μM) was not synergistic, but displayed similar improvements in lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) suggest-
ing igdb-1 might exhibit ZA-induced downregulation (A), or act independently to increase healthspan. Conversely, let-756 (FGF21, B) is dispensable for
both lifespan and healthspan extension with ZA. The mitochondrial sirtuins displayed opposing effects; sir-2.2 (SIRT-4, C) is dispensable for ZA’s
healthspan effects, whereas sir-2.3 (SIRT-4) knockdown increased survival and movement (D), as did ZA co-treatment, suggesting sir-2.3 downregula-
tion might mediate ZA’s healthspan effects. Asterisks denote signiﬁcance to empty vector controls. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. ‘#’ denote

knockdown
animals,
the
mevalonate-FOXO
pathway
is
strongly implicated in the ageing neuromuscular health bene-
ﬁts of bisphosphonates.
Bi-directional communication between muscle and bone
has long been established, including mechanical coupling
and endocrine muscle-bone signalling.13,24 We, therefore, ex-
amined the mechanistic role of three putative muscle-derived
signalling
factors
(‘myokines’)
involved
in
muscle-bone
crosstalk that exhibit altered age-related function.24 Of these,
agxt-2/BAIBA was necessary for the positive healthspan ef-
fects of ZA, while agxt-2 KD alone was not harmful to animal
longevity or health. BAIBA promotes insulin sensitivity, anti-
inﬂammation38 and osteocyte survival in mice,39 and its ex-
pression does not decline with age39; thus, BAIBA-mediated
muscle/health beneﬁts of bisphosphonates would be antici-
pated to remain in older age. Knockdown of igdb-1/FNDC5
extended worm lifespan and healthspan, countering human
studies implicating low circulating FNDC5 as a sarcopenia
biomarker.40 The healthspan effects of igdb-1 KD were also
comparable with ZA co-treatment. This inability of idgb-1
KD to neither ablate nor synergistically augment the positive
effects
of
ZA
could
be
interpreted
as
ZA
exerting
healthspan-promoting inhibitory effects on igdb-1 or, alterna-
tively, acting through igdb-1 independent pathways. Con-
versely, let-756/FGF21 appears dispensable for ZA-induced
lifespan and healthspan extension. Because C. elegans lack
an endoskeleton, these ﬁndings espouse agxt-2/BAIBA and
igdb-1/FNDC5 as muscle-intrinsic, bone-independent mecha-
nisms of bisphosphonate action on improving sarcopenia.
Recent rodent work showed that bisphosphonates attenu-
ate
denervation
atrophy
by
down-regulating
sirtuin-3
(SIRT3),19 a mitochondrially localized NAD+-dependent de-
acetylase
with
important
roles
in
regulating
skeletal
muscle metabolism. We observed that knocking-down a
C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuin, sir-2.3, improved life- and
healthspan, whereas mitochondrial sir-2.2 KD had no effect,
as reported by others.33 Because sir-2.3 KD with combined
ZA was neither inhibitory nor synergistically beneﬁcial
to lifespan or healthspan, this supports the model of
bisphosphonate-mediated mitochondrial sirtuin inhibition as
a regulator of mammalian muscle health19 and now sarcope-
nia. Loss of sir-2.2 was, however, dispensable for the positive
effects of ZA. Along with improved mitochondrial structure
observed herein, growing evidence thus suggests that
bisphosphonates act at least partially through mitochondrial
mechanisms to lessen the effects of sarcopenia.
In conclusion,
chronic bisphosphonate administration
delays the onset of muscle structural and mitochondrial
decline in a C. elegans model of sarcopenia, and this translates
to improved animal health across the entire life course.
The mechanisms regulating the positive ageing/muscle
effects of bisphosphonates appear to be conserved across
species
and
include
the
mevalonate-FOXO
metabolic
axis, mitochondrial sirtuins and muscle-derived cytokines.
Because worms lack an endoskeleton, these mechanisms of
bisphosphonates can also be muscle-intrinsic. By directly im-
plicating bisphosphonates in attenuating the consequences
of sarcopenia, this study adds to a growing body of evidence
that bisphosphonates are a clinically safe, immediately exploit-
able anti-sarcopenia therapeutic.
