Abstract
A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is
melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood
cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have
revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is
an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that par-
ticipates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable
mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during
both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but
hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type.
Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic
phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a
route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable
genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difﬁcult to study in higher
organisms.

Introduction
Drosophila is well studied as a model of innate immunity in humans and has been
instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that
involve both immune induction and hematopoiesis (Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007).
The Drosophila Toll pathway mediates the response to microbial infections, and
humans were subsequently found to have a family of Toll receptors that also
respond to infections. Other shared immune signaling pathways are the Imd
(immune deﬁciency)/TNF1 (tumor necrosis factor 1), JNK (Jun kinase), and JAK-
STAT (Janus kinase-STAT transcription factor) pathways. Activation of NFkB
transcription factors, which regulate target genes such as cytokines and antimicro-
bial proteins, is a key shared feature (Wang and Ligoxygakis 2006). Like the
signaling pathways, the cell and tissue components of the Drosophila and human
immune systems are analogous (Kimbrell and Beutler 2001). In Drosophila, the
hemocytes and the fat body mediate, respectively, the major cellular and humoral
arms of the response. Hemocytes participate in immune signaling to the fat body,
phagocytosis, damaged tissue surveillance, encapsulation of foreign intruders, and
remodeling of cells during development and also respond to aberrant self-cells to
form melanotic tumors/pseudotumors (Babcock et al. 2008; Brennan et al. 2007;
Gateff 1994; Rizki and Rizki 1983; Tepass et al. 1994; Vass and Nappi 2000). The
fat body, like the mammalian liver, produces abundant humoral response molecules,
including antimicrobial peptides released into the hemolymph (Aggrawal and
Silverman 2007).
Drosophila produces three types of hemocytes: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and
crystal cells (Crozatier and Meister 2007). Plasmatocytes account for *95% of total
blood cells and most functions. In particular, plasmatocytes are responsible for the
phagocytosis of microorganisms during an infection and apoptotic cells during
development. Lamellocytes are produced only in response to parasites or by
mutations that produce melanotic tumors. Crystal cells constitute *5% of total
blood cells and are involved in melanization. As in vertebrates, Drosophila blood
cells also have two developmental origins: one early in the embryonic head
mesoderm and another during larval development in the lymph gland (Evans et al.
2003). Molecular cascades and factors regulating hematopoiesis are also shared with
humans and involve many pathways, for example, Toll, JAK/STAT, Hedgehog,
Notch, GATA, and Runx (Evans and Banerjee 2003; Mandal et al. 2007).
A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is that of
melanotic tumors or nodules. Melanotic nodules may be in the hemocoel or
associated with the lymph glands and consist of abnormal and overproliferated
blood cells that are covered by lamellocytes and melanized, similar to the immune
response to a parasitic wasp egg (Luo et al. 1995; Meister and Lagueux 2003;
Minakhina and Steward 2006b; Stofanko et al. 2008). Mutations in a variety of
genes and genetic pathways have been found to produce this phenotype, such as
JAK–STAT, which is also associated with blood cell overproliferation in humans,
the Toll pathway, and Ras/MAPK (Asha et al. 2003; Li 2008; Minakhina and
Steward 2006a; Zettervall et al. 2004). Some other genes with this mutant
phenotype are air8, encoding ribosomal protein s6 (Watson et al. 1992); black pearl,

encoding a DnaJ homolog (Becker et al. 2001); l(3)malignant blood neoplasm,
encoding a protein with human cytokeratin homology (Gateff 1994); yantar,
encoding a conserved arginine-rich protein (Sinenko et al. 2004); and the Polycomb
group gene multi sex combs (Remillieux-Leschelle et al. 2002). The melanotic
tumor genes are an important category to identify and deﬁne in order to understand
blood cell function and regulation.
In a P-element enhancer detector screen concentrating on immune-related tissues
and phenotypes, we identiﬁed the melanotic tumor gene dappled (dpld) (Rodriguez
et al. 1996). Enhancer detector expression of dappled was high in the fat body,
oenocytes, ring gland, and gut. Lethal and viable mutations of dappled produced
melanotic tumors, and lethal mutation was also associated with aberrant tissue
morphology, for example, of the fat body and gut (Rodriguez et al. 1996). A
distinguishing feature of dappled mutants is consistent melanotic tumor formation,
in contrast to other melanotic tumor mutants, which typically have low and variable
rates. We now report identiﬁcation of dappled as a member of the cytochrome b5
family. Cytochrome b5 is a conserved, ubiquitous, small hemoprotein that
participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways,
such as fatty acid desaturation, cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions, sterol
metabolism, and conversion of methemoglobin (Schenkman and Jansson 2003).
Cytochrome b5 is thus involved in processes such as metabolism of endogenous and
xenobiotic compounds, maintenance of oxygen levels, and production of steroid
hormones (Locuson et al. 2007; Miller 2005; Yamazaki and Shimada 2006).
Cytochrome b5 genetics in higher organisms has not been very amenable to study,
and dappled provides a new avenue of approach for study of cytochrome b5
functions. In this report, we characterize the dappled mutant hemocyte phenotype
and present the potential to study cytochrome b5 function by screening for
compounds that affect the dappled hemocyte phenotype.
Materials and Methods
Drosophila Stocks and Rearing
Oregon R ﬂies were used as the standard wild-type strain. The dappled mutants are
the dpldMLB (97/16) and dpldEJL (142/2) strains of Rodriguez et al. (1996).
Experiments were performed using dpldMLB/dpldEJL transheterozygotes or dpld
mutants hemizygous with Df(2R)ST1 (Bloomington Stock Center). The hemese-
Gal4 strain is that of Zettervall et al. (2004). The UAS-dappled transgenic strain was
made using the cDNA clone RE66521 from the Bloomington Drosophila Genome
Project, which matched our splice product for dappled mRNA (see below). The
insert of plasmid RE66521 was isolated using the EcoRI and BamHI restriction
enzyme sites, ligated into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pUAST vector using
BamHI/XbaI linkers, and transgenic strains made by Genetic Services, Inc. Insertion
strains of UAS-dappled into chromosomes X, 2, and 3 were recovered. All stocks
were raised on the Bloomington Stock Center food recipe in a 25C incubator.
For the curcumin-raised ﬂies, the food, before cooling, was supplemented with

20 mg/ml curcumin (Sigma), and parents were placed onto the food for mating and
egg laying. Compare with Gupta et al. (2009), in which doses for mice were 5, 30,
and 60 mg/kg orally, daily for 19 days, and note that at 100 mg/ml, ﬂies had high
lethality in addition to developmental delay.
Molecular Genetic Analysis
Genomic DNA fragments ﬂanking the dappled 97/16 (k09716) and 142/2 (k14202)
P-element insertion sites were recovered by the plasmid rescue technique (Wilson
et al. 1989), sequenced (Davis Sequencing), and aligned to the genome (Blast). The
PCR primers used to compare the 88/15 (k08815) strain P-element insertion
sequences AQ034113 and AQ025871 (Tweedie et al. 2009) to wild-type sequences
were TATCGTCGCTGTGCTTACAGAT (60, forward) and CTAAACCTCCAA
TTCGGCTATG (61, reverse) at the AQ034113 end and CTCCACGCGTAATA
TACCCATT (58, forward) and AGTCATGGATGCGTAGTCACAC (59, reverse)
at the AQ025871 end. In order to conﬁrm the 88/15 insertion site, PCR fragments
that resulted from the P-element end primer RsyII (Tweedie et al. 2009) in
combination with primers 59 and 60 were sequenced. The PCR primers used to test
for possible alternative splicing of CG2140/dappled were sequences 55, 56, and 57
(Fig. 1). The sequence of the single transcript detected was translated to an amino
acid sequence and placed into the cytochrome b5 family by Blast comparison.
Clustal W was used to align the dappled cytochrome b5 sequence to selected other
cytochrome b5 proteins.
Northern Blot Analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion), and poly-A RNA was
isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA Puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen). The RNA was
run on formaldehyde gels and transferred overnight using Ambion Northern Max
reagents. The dappled probe was 642 bp deﬁned by the primers 55 and 57 (Fig. 1).
This 642 bp PCR fragment was subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen),
following the manufacturer’s protocol. After blue/white screening to select the
colony, PCR and sequencing were used to conﬁrm the insert and determine
orientation. Transcription used T7 polymerase and 32P-labeled UTP and the Ambion
Strip EZ kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. The rp49 probe was made using
Fig. 1 The dappled locus. a Four P-element insertions in dappled/CG2140 produce mutations with a
melanotic tumor phenotype (k09716, k00107, k14202, and 01857). These four dappled insertions and the
03427 and 05643 insertions are included within the k08815 deletion. Insertions 03610 and 08492 are
outside the dappled and k08815 regions. One dappled mRNA transcript has been detected, and it has one
intron spanning from ?120 to ?1712 (dotted line). The numbers 55, 56, and 57 indicate the positions of
PCR primers used to test for alternative mRNA splicing products; only the 55–57 pair produced a PCR
product. Black bars indicate the dappled protein coding region. b Sequence of the dappled/CG2140 gene.

ager and ImageJ were used to analyze the hybridization signal.
Blood Cell Counts
Third-instar larvae were developmentally staged as early versus late wandering
phase based on retention in the gut of food dye (Zettervall et al. 2004). The Bright-
Line Counting Chamber (Fisher) hemocytometer was used to count blood cells
stained with monochlorobimane dye (Tirouvanziam et al. 2004) or GFP-expressing
blood cells as in Zettervall et al. (2004), except that instead of red food color we
used blue (Deep Blue Shade, Esco Foods, Inc.). Siblings that were heterozygous for
dappled were distinguished based on either a CyO balancer with the marker y?
(i.e., y; ?/dpld vs. y; ?/CyO, y?) or B-galactosidase staining to indicate presence or
absence of a dpld enhancer trap (Rodriguez et al. 1996). Separate counts of blood
cells in y versus y? larvae established that y did not affect the blood cell counts.
Determination of sex was by the size of the gonads or by marking the sexes with
y versus y?. Hemocyte counts from different samples were compared using the
t test, and P values were calculated using VassarStats (http://faculty.vassar.edu/
lowry/VassarStats.html).
Results
Cytochrome b5, the Encoded Product of dappled
The original dappled alleles, dpldEJL and dpldMLB, result from the P-element
insertions (P-lacW) in strains 142/2 (k14202) and 97/16 (k09716), respectively
(Rodriguez et al. 1996). The dpldEJL allele is homozygous and hemizygous lethal,
and dpldMLB is homozygous and hemizygous viable. Heteroallelic dpldEJL/dpldMLB
is also viable and, like dpldEJL and dpldMLB homozygotes and hemizygotes, has
melanotic tumors (Rodriguez et al. 1996). In order to identify the gene associated
with the melanotic tumor phenotype, we molecularly cloned and sequenced the
dappled gene. We used the technique of plasmid rescue to isolate the genomic DNA
ﬂanking the k14202 and k09716 insertions. Sequencing of the ﬂanking DNA and
alignment to the genome placed both insertions into the 50 UTR of CG2140
(Tweedie et al. 2009), with k09716 46 bp farther upstream than k14202 (Fig. 1).
In contrast to our results, genome annotation assigned dappled as CG1624 based
on the position of the lethal P-element insertion 88/15 (k08815), which did not
complement the 142/2 insertion (Spradling et al. 1999). We therefore investigated
this discrepancy in the identiﬁcation of dappled. The 50 and 30 ﬂanking sequences
for the k08815 insertion are 30-AQ034113 and 50-AQ025871. Alignment of these
ﬂanking sequences on the latest Drosophila genome sequence, however, places
them 176,059 bp apart. There are several potential causes for this gap in the
sequence: multiple insertions, an error in data reporting, or a large deletion. To test
for the accuracy of the k08815 ﬂanking sequence, primers were designed to (1) ﬂank
334

123

the 30 and 50 insertion sites of the k08815 transposon and (2) extend from a
P-element end primer (pRsyII) into a ﬂanking sequence. The resultant PCR
fragments supported the published ﬂanking sequences, as wild-type products were
not observed in the mutant strain and both insertion sites were veriﬁed with the
P-element end primer (Fig. 1). Finally, these PCR products were sequenced to
provide conﬁrmation of the ﬂanking sequences. These results indicate that k08815 is
not a simple insertion but is associated with additional disruption at its genomic
position. We set out to differentiate between either multiple insertions or a large
deletion by performing complementation tests with other lethal insertion strains in
the region. Complementation tests conﬁrmed that a large deletion accompanies the
k08815 insertion (Fig. 1). Complementation and mapping also placed two more
insertions, k00107 and 01857, into the 50 UTR and intron of CG2140/dappled,
respectively (Fig. 1).
We tested these various dappled mutants for alterations in transcription, further
conﬁrming that the dappled phenotype results from an effect on CG2140, by
performing Northern blot analysis using RNA from dappled mutants. This analysis
showed a decrease in CG2140 transcript levels in the dappled mutants compared
with the Oregon R controls (Fig. 2). The dappled strains are hypomorphic, with the
lethal alleles stronger. The lethal allele dpldEJL expresses approximately 10% of
wild-type embryonic RNA levels, whereas the viable allele dpldMLB has *80% of
wild-type adult RNA levels. Analysis of the transcripts by RT-PCR and sequencing
showed one splice variant, with a single intron (Fig. 1).

Based on sequence homology from our alignments and the Flybase Genome
Annotation, Drosophila gene CG2140/dappled encodes a microsomal cytochrome
b5 (Fig. 1; http://ﬂybase.org/reports/FBgn0033189.html). Genome annotation has
identiﬁed CG2140 as the only cytochrome b5 in Drosophila. One related
Drosophila sequence has been identiﬁed, cytochrome b5-related (Cyt-b5-r; http://
ﬂybase.org/reports/FBgn0000406.html). Cyt-b5-r has 436 residues (there are only
134 for Dappled and 135 for human cytochrome b5), and only 30 of the Cyt-b5-r
residues are identical to the Dappled sequence. In a comparison of the dappled
encoded amino acid sequence with a selection of other cytochrome b5 proteins from
mammals and insects, Dappled has 45% identity with human cytochrome b5 and
76% identity with houseﬂy cytochrome b5 (Fig. 3). Overall, the selected mammals
and insects have 32% identity. Cytochrome b5 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous
family of small hemoproteins that participate in electron transfer in multiple bio-
chemical reactions. These reactions are involved in many biological processes, such
Fig. 3 Cytochrome b5 sequences. The sequences of Dappled and selected other cytochrome b5 proteins
from insects and mammals are compared using Clustal W for alignment and consensus generation (Prim.
Cons.). See Wang et al. (2007) for an X-ray crystal structure comparison of the heme binding domain,
residues 6–95. Note the high sequence identity within this region, which is 82% for residues 40–73.

as conversion of methemoglobin, sterol metabolism, fatty acid desaturation, and
cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions (Schenkman and Jansson 2003).
Hemocyte Misregulation and Melanotic Nodule Formation in dappled Mutants
The dpldMLB insertion has made analysis possible, as in addition to producing
consistent melanotic tumor formation, it is the only viable allele. Maintenance of
dpldMLB homozygotes as a stock, however, was not feasible because of effects on
fertility. Homozygous dpldMLB or transheterozygous dpldMLB/dpldEJL females and
males produced few progeny, even when mated with wild-type ﬂies (\5 progeny/
dappled parent), and mutant females laid few eggs (*50/female). It is unlikely that
this fertility problem is due simply to physical obstruction in the abdomen, because
ﬂies with less obtrusive tumors (i.e., small tumors near the thorax) also show low
fertility. To avoid the effects of accumulation of second site mutations by
maintaining the dpldMLB chromosome over a balancer, all experiments were done on
progeny from crosses that produced transheterozygotes or hemizygotes.
The development of the Gal4–UAS system (Brand and Perrimon 1993) to include
drivers for the hematopoietic system makes it more feasible to be able to investigate
the blood cell phenotypes of mutant genes, for example, Kimbrell et al. (2002) and
Zettervall et al. (2004). The hemese-Gal4 construct drives expression in blood cells
of the plasmatocyte and lamellocyte classes (Zettervall et al. 2004). Strains with
hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP thus have the blood cells marked with GFP, enabling
hemocyte counting and phenotype analysis in various genetic strains (Zettervall
et al. 2004). We used hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP to investigate the blood cells of
dappled melanotic tumor mutants. In melanotic tumors of dpldEJL/dpldMLB; hemese-
Gal4 UAS-GFP larvae, all of the cells in the masses were found to ﬂuoresce
strongly for GFP (Fig. 4). Cell counts of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes
showed large numbers of circulating lamellocytes (Fig. 4). Lamellocytes are not
found in normal, healthy larvae, whereas in melanotic nodule mutants lamellocytes
are abundant (Crozatier and Meister 2007). The dappled melanotic tumors are thus
speciﬁcally designated as melanotic nodules, which consist of hemocytes, as
opposed to melanizations, which are non-blood cell tissues that have melanized
(Minakhina and Steward 2006b).
Mutant dappled larvae were categorized based on the relative size of the
melanotic nodules. Larvae with small versus large melanotic nodules showed
different numbers of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes (Fig. 4). Notably,
lamellocytes are more prevalent in small tumors, whereas plasmatocytes are more
abundant in large nodules. One possible interpretation of the higher number of
lamellocytes in smaller nodules is that these nodules are still actively forming, and
lamellocytes are still being recruited to the nodules. During normal larval
development, the number of plasmatocytes typically increases two- to threefold
from the early wandering (early) to the late wandering (late) stage of the third instar
(Crozatier and Meister 2007; Zettervall et al. 2004). Plasmatocyte representation
from early to late stage wandering was different for small and large tumors. Larvae
with large tumors showed an increase from early to late stage, whereas larvae with

337
123

small tumors did not (Fig. 4), and this may also reﬂect the dynamic nature of
dappled melanotic nodule formation.
Heterozygosity of dappled does not produce tumors, but it does have a dominant
effect on blood cell number. The dappled heterozygotes (Bal/dpld) have a
signiﬁcantly higher number of plasmatocytes than wild-type larvae (?/?). This
difference was conﬁrmed by counting hemocytes of dappled heterozygotes (dpld/?)
and their control siblings (Bal/?) (Fig. 5). Further, counts of siblings showed that
the increase in plasmatocytes is present both early and late in the third instar. The
Fig. 4 Hemocytes of dappled viable mutants. a Hemocytes visualized by GFP expression show (left)
melanotic tumors/nodules in a third-instar larva as clumps of hemocytes that are partially melanized,
along with circulating plasmatocytes, and (right), at higher magniﬁcation, lamellocytes. Lamellocytes are
approximately four times larger than plasmatocytes. GFP expression is driven by the hemese-Gal4 driver.
b Cell counts of circulating hemocytes in early and late wandering third-instar larvae show high levels of
lamellocytes and characterize the dynamic process of melanotic tumor formation by comparing mutants
with small (left bars) versus large (right bars) melanotic nodules. Error bars show 0.95 conﬁdence limits.

123

relative numbers of lamellocytes in dappled heterozygotes is less clear, as the
average was very low, many larvae had no lamellocytes, and the number did not
increase from early to late stage (Fig. 5). Thus, although the lamellocyte data are
statistically signiﬁcant (P \ 0.05), dappled heterozygosity at most yields a very
weak induction of lamellocyte differentiation.
Rescue of Hemocyte Phenotype but Not Lethality by Wild-Type dappled
in Blood Cells
We next asked if the dappled phenotype could be rescued by expressing wild-type
dappled only in blood cells. We constructed a plasmid containing UAS-dpld, which
was used to make transgenic strains with UAS-dpld in different chromosomal
locations. The hemese-Gal4 was then used to drive UAS-dpld, and the rates of
melanotic nodule formation were compared in dappled mutants and controls. In
addition to hemocytes, hemese-Gal4 drives strong expression in the salivary glands,

so a control salivary gland driver, sgs3-Gal4, was also used to drive UAS-dpld. To
test for rescue of lethality by ubiquitous expression, the da-Gal4 driver (Pili-Floury
et al. 2004) was used.
The dappled mutants with hemese-Gal4, but not sgs3-Gal4, driving UAS-dpld are
rescued from the melanotic phenotype. Three different UAS-dpld insertions were
tested with hemese-Gal4, and all showed similar rates of rescue (Table 1).
Dissections were performed to determine if blood cell nodules might be forming but
not melanizing. The dissections conﬁrmed that blood cell nodule formation without
accompanying melanization did not occur.
The dominant effect of heterozygous dappled on plasmatocyte number is also
rescued by adding dappled expression to blood cells. Hemocyte counts of dappled
heterozygotes with hemese-Gal4 driving UAS-dpld had, on average, reduced
numbers of hemocytes, compared with control dappled heterozygotes (Fig. 6).
The number of lamellocytes in heterozygotes was also reduced on average, but
with the small number and variability in lamellocytes, was not signiﬁcantly
different (Fig. 6). These results do not necessarily rule out other tissues as
important for the dappled mutant blood cell phenotypes, but rather emphasize that
the level of dappled expression in the blood cells regulates number and
differentiation.
Expression of wild-type dappled in blood cells did not rescue the mutant
lethality. In contrast, ubiquitous expression of wild-type dappled completely
rescued the mutant lethality, producing normal adults with no tumors (Table 2).
These results are consistent with the aberrant tissue morphology of lethal dappled
(Rodriguez et al. 1996) and establish the importance of dappled transcript levels for
normal function in other tissues.

Effect of dappled on Hematopoietic Waves During Development
The dappled nodules form early in larval development, which is more consistent
with an increase of plasmatocytes from the ﬁrst hematopoietic wave (embryonic
origin) rather than the second hematopoietic wave (lymph gland origin at the end of
the third instar). As noted above, plasmatocytes in dappled tumors express the
hemese-Gal4 driver, which does not express in the lymph glands, further indicating
an early developmental origin for these cells. Additionally, the lymph glands appear
normal, at least at a gross level, and only one dappled enhancer trap expresses in the
lymph glands (Rodriguez et al. 1996). We analyzed 1 kb of the dappled upstream
region for potential binding by blood cell, lymph gland, and other transcription
factors using the Transfac database (Wingender 2008) provided by Biobase
Biological Databases (http://www.biobase-international.com/index.php?id=home).
Among the transcription factor binding sites are many that are predicted to be T cell
factor/pan binding sites (Brunner et al. 1997), consistent with blood cell expression,
and tinman/Nkx2.5 binding sites (Kimbrell et al. 2002), suggesting lymph gland
expression (Table 3).

We tested for dappled effects in both hematopoietic waves by counting
plasmatocytes at a time in development when cells of both hematopoietic waves
are present. Cells of the two waves were differentiated by (1) using hemese-Gal4
to drive UAS-GFP in cells from the ﬁrst wave of development, so that ﬁrst-wave
cells ﬂuoresced green, and (2) staining all hemocytes with monochlorobimane
dye, so that the second-wave hemocytes ﬂuoresced blue but not green. The
developmental stage selected to have both sets of hemocytes was white prepupae,
age 0–3 h postformation as white prepupae. These results show that heterozy-
gosity of dappled increases the number of plasmatocytes from both hematopoietic
waves (Table 4).
Mutation of dappled affects both sexes similarly, and our results show both sexes
together (Figs. 4, 5, 6). Similar numbers of the sexes are needed per sample,

however, as the sexes differ in the number of hemocytes. For the experiment
depicted in Table 4, we separated the sexes in order to demonstrate this ﬁnding
and test for a sex difference in the second hematopoietic wave as well. The
results are that in both wild type and dappled there is a signiﬁcant difference
between males and females in the number of hemocytes for both hematopoietic
waves.
Curcumin Enhancement of the dappled Melanotic Phenotype
Cytochrome b5 is widely studied for its effects on drug metabolism, and conversely,
various drugs are investigated for alteration of cytochrome b5 levels (El-Lakkany
et al. 2004; Juvonen et al. 1992; Portoles et al. 1989; Schenkman and Jansson 1999;
Sheweita 2004; Yamaori et al. 2003; Yamazaki et al. 2002). We hypothesized that
modulation of the dappled phenotype could be used as an in vivo assay for
cytochrome b5 related effects of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. We are
therefore screening compounds with a known connection to cytochrome P450s and/
or anti-inﬂammatory and anticarcinogenic properties for enhancement or suppres-
sion of the dappled melanotic phenotype. Initial studies with aspirin and the
corticosteroid dexamethasone are negative (data not shown), whereas curcumin, the
active ingredient in the spice turmeric, has consistently shown an enhancement of
the melanotic phenotype (Table 5; Fig. 7). Adult dappled mutants that have been
raised (egg to adult) on curcumin-supplemented food have an enhanced melanotic
phenotype, showing more and/or larger melanotic tumors (Table 5). The enhanced
phenotype of the dappled mutants is already evident in the larval stages (Fig. 7).
Adult dappled heterozygotes, however, do not develop a melanotic phenotype when
raised on curcumin (Table 5). Since both the heterozygotes and heteroallelic
mutants have some reduction in dappled transcript levels, the effects of curcumin
may depend on the exact amount of cytochrome b5 protein that is produced.

Discussion
We have identiﬁed dappled as a member of the conserved, ubiquitous cytochrome
b5 family. The complexities of cytochrome b5 function, through its participation in
electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions, are reﬂected in the difﬁculties
and limited study of its genetics in higher organisms. Characterizations in humans
have shown that cytochrome b5 mutation causes methemoglobinemia, which
interferes with the balance between hemoglobin and methemoglobin, thus affecting
oxygenation and inﬂammation (Hegesh et al. 1986; Umbreit 2007). Mutation of
cytochrome b5 reductase also causes methemoglobinemia and is more common
(Davis et al. 2004). In addition, one case of cytochrome b5 methemoglobinemia
may also have been associated with hormonal defects (Giordano et al. 1994). With
the exception of a porcine mutation associated with an altered androstenone level
(Lin et al. 2005), cytochrome b5 mutations in other organisms have not been
identiﬁed. In mice, cytochrome b5 deletion is also lethal, but experiments with a
tissue-speciﬁc knockout have allowed liver function to be addressed (Finn et al.
2008). With our studies of dappled, Drosophila now provides a tractable genetic
model for the study of cytochrome b5 in blood cells and other tissues.
Hemocytes are particularly sensitive to mutation of dappled and show that
cytochrome b5 functions to produce normal differentiation and numbers of
hemocytes. Mutation of one copy of dappled results in a signiﬁcant increase in
the number of circulating hemocytes, and mutation of both copies results in the
formation of melanotic nodules. The formation of dappled melanotic nodules is a
Class 2 reaction in the classiﬁcation of Watson et al. (1991), in which Class 2
represents alteration of immune cells and Class 1 represents normal immune cells
responding to other cell types that are aberrant. The dominant effect on blood cell
number emphasizes that wild-type levels of cytochrome b5 are needed for full
normal functions. In humans, levels of cytochrome b5 have been implicated as
important with respect to xenobiotic metabolism and health. Kurian et al. (2007)
hypothesized that functionally signiﬁcant genetic variability in cytochrome b5
occurs in individuals without clinical symptoms. They investigated processing
of hydroxylamines, which are oxidative products of arylamine drugs and

environmental carcinogens, by the mutant cytochrome b5 of one heterozygous
individual and found, in vitro, altered afﬁnity for hydroxylamine substrates and
dramatically reduced cytochrome b5 expression (Kurian et al. 2007).
Expression of wild-type dappled in hemocytes rescued both the increase in blood
cell number and the formation of melanotic nodules. The driver used was hemese-
Gal4, which is active in circulating plasmatocytes and sessile hemocytes, but not the
lymph glands (Markus et al. 2009; Zettervall et al. 2004). Interestingly, the sessile
hemocytes are a newly discovered hematopoietic site and appear to be the main
developmental origin of lamellocytes (Markus et al. 2009). This site of expression
may be the key factor in rescuing the dappled melanotic nodule phenotype. Rescue

of the plasmatocyte increase in dappled heterozygotes is expected to result from the
hemese-Gal4 expression in circulating blood cells of the ﬁrst hematopoietic wave,
both because of the age of the larvae (prerelease of lymph gland cells) and because
hemese-Gal4 does not express in lymph glands. However, dappled also increased
the number of hemocytes from the second hematopoietic wave. Hemocytes from
both developmental origins, embryonic and lymph gland, require dappled in order
to be produced in normal amounts. It is an interesting question as to whether the
plasmatocyte increase in dappled mutants can be independently controlled in the
ﬁrst and second hematopoietic waves.
Does the increase in plasmatocytes indicate overproliferation or less apoptosis?
Since dappled encodes a cytochrome b5, the obvious choice would be apoptosis
rather than overproliferation. There are two problems with this choice: it is
mitochondrial cytochrome b5 that is established in the canonical cytochrome C
signaling apoptotic pathway, and the use of that pathway by Drosophila is
controversial (Kornbluth and White 2005; Means and Hays 2007; Oberst et al. 2008;
Ow et al. 2008). Microsomal cytochrome b5, however, has also been suggested to
be involved in cytochrome C mediated apoptosis (Davydov 2001), and Drosophila
may have its own version of apoptotic signaling that uses the dappled cytochrome
b5. Further, blood cells are well described for their role in response to apoptotic
cells, but the role of their own apoptosis in development and infection is not clear
(Bruckner et al. 2004; Crozatier and Meister 2007; Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007).
The sensitivity of hemocytes (compared with other cell types) to dappled
mutation may result from blood cell mitotic cell division continuing during
development (Crozatier and Meister 2007). There are many potential mechanisms
for dappled to affect overproliferation, especially given the increasingly complex
functions of plasmatocytes (Charroux and Royet 2009). One option consistent with
cytochrome b5 function, and potentially the dappled effects on fertility, is that
hormonal signaling of hematopoiesis is affected. In that case, however, rescue of the
dappled blood cell phenotype would be predicted by adding back wild-type dappled
expression in the steroid-producing ring gland (Gilbert 2004) rather than hemocytes.
Alternatively, dappled expression could rescue a steroid-processing step in the
hemocytes.
An intriguing option is that cytochrome b5 has a new, previously unidentiﬁed
role in blood cell signaling pathways, for example, through JAK/Stat or JNK. More
speciﬁcally, a candidate to mediate the effects of dappled is TNF-receptor
associated factor 6 (Traf6), which is predicted from protein studies to interact with
cytochrome b5 (Drosophila Interactions Database, http://www.droidb.org). Among
its activities, Traf6 is an upstream activator of nuclear factor-kappaB, and mutants
are immune response defective (Cha et al. 2003; Wu and Arron 2003). Cytochrome
b5 involvement with Traf6 is a testable hypothesis through analysis of genetic
interaction between dappled and Traf6 mutants.
Our results with curcumin demonstrate that screening of endogenous and
xenobiotic compounds for effects on the dappled phenotypes can be done as an in
vivo approach for analysis of cytochrome b5. Curcumin is widely studied for its
potential as a nutritional pharmaceutical (Duvoix et al. 2005; Jagetia and Aggarwal
2007). Among its many activities, which are mainly anti-inﬂammatory and
346
Biochem Genet (2011) 49:329–351
123

anticancer, curcumin inhibits cytochrome P450s, down-regulates NFkB, and affects
apoptosis and the cell cycle (Alpers 2008; Appiah-Opong et al. 2007; Kwon et al.
2007; Sa and Das 2008). Curcumin enhanced the melanotic phenotype of dappled
mutants. This effect of curcumin is consistent with NFkB involvement, but there are
other alternatives, in particular, cytochrome P450 processing in the fat body.
Mutation of dappled showed similar effects in females and males, but an
unexpected consequence of our studies is the ﬁnding that females and males differ
signiﬁcantly in the number of circulating blood cells. In humans, a difference
between the sexes in the numbers of blood cell types is well established, but the
effects are unclear (Blum and Pabst 2007; Huppert et al. 1998; Reichert et al. 1991).
In both humans and Drosophila, there are differences in the immune responses
between the sexes that affect health (Dale et al. 2006; Marriott and Huet-Hudson
2006; Shames 2002; Taylor and Kimbrell 2007; Ye et al. 2009; Zandman-Goddard
et al. 2007), and the blood cell number differential may be part of mediating the
immune response differences. Recently, Drosophila hemocytes have been shown to
directly signal immune induction of the fat body, and a reduced number of
hemocytes resulted in less immune induction (Shia et al. 2009). In Drosophila, the
increase in hemocytes of dappled and females may result in higher immune
induction, which may or may not provide a healthier condition. For example, human
females typically have a more robust immune response but also a higher incidence
of autoimmune disorders (Dale et al. 2006; Zandman-Goddard et al. 2007).
Cytochrome b5 expression is critical for survival, and its importance to
hemocytes and additional tissues is emphasized by the ﬁnding that ubiquitous, but
not hemocyte, expression of wild-type dappled rescued lethality. The functions of
cytochrome b5 are open for testing in a wide range of tissue types using dappled. In
all respects, genetic interaction and drug screens for suppressors and enhancers of
dappled will be useful ways to discern the many roles of cytochrome b5 function.
