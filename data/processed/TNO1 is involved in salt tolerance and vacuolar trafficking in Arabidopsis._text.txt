The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved
in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved
in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named
TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identiﬁed by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein.
TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to
high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is
involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast
in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efﬁcient protein trafﬁcking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had
delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efﬁcient
membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon
BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafﬁcking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in
vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.
The plant vacuole is a versatile organelle that has
important functions, including maintaining turgor, ion
homeostasis, compartmentalizing toxic material, accu-
mulating defense compounds, and storing and degrad-
ing proteins (Marty, 1999). To maintain these functions,
correct transport of vacuolar proteins is required. Vac-
uolar proteins are synthesized at the endoplasmic re-
ticulum (ER) and are transported cotranslationally into
the ER lumen. From the ER, they are transported to the
trans-Golgi network (TGN) via the Golgi (To¨rma¨kangas
et al., 2001). In the TGN, vacuolar proteins with sequence-
speciﬁc vacuolar sorting determinants are thought to
be recognized by vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs;
Kirsch et al., 1994; Ahmed et al., 2000; daSilva et al.,
2005), although a recent report has suggested that
recognition of cargo by VSRs may occur as early as
the ER (Niemes et al., 2010). Storage proteins with
C-terminal sorting sequences are also bound by VSRs
or by a second putative sorting receptor, RMR1 (Jiang
et al., 2000; Shimada et al., 2003a; Park et al., 2005, 2007;
Hinz et al., 2007). After the receptors recognize their
cargo, vacuolar proteins are transported to the pre-
vacuolar compartment (PVC; Sanderfoot et al., 1998;
Happel et al., 2004; Song et al., 2006) before transport
on to the vacuole. In mammalian cells, cargo receptors
are recycled from their destination to the site of cargo
binding (Seaman, 2005). VSR1 was found to localize to
the TGN and the PVC (Paris et al., 1997; Sanderfoot
et al., 1998); thus, VSR1 was also suggested to cycle
between these organelles.
Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attach-
ment protein receptors (SNAREs) are integral mem-
brane proteins required for the fusion of vesicles with
their target membrane. SNAREs can be classiﬁed based
on their site of function: v (vesicle)-SNAREs are local-
ized to the vesicle membrane, and t (target)-SNAREs
are localized to the target membrane (Rothman, 1994;
Søgaard et al., 1994). Generally, one v-SNARE on the
vesicle and three t-SNAREs on the target membrane
form a trans-SNARE complex, bringing the two mem-
branes in contact and driving membrane fusion (McNew
et al., 2000). Clathrin-coated vesicles containing VSR1
contain the v-SNARE VTI11, which forms a SNARE
complex with SYP5, SYP2, and VAMP727 at the PVC
during anterograde trafﬁcking from the TGN (Kirsch
et al., 1994; Sanderfoot et al., 2001a; Ebine et al., 2008).
However, the mechanism of recycling of VSR1 from
the PVC to the TGN is not yet fully understood. A
complex containing the SNAREs SYP41, SYP61, and
VTI12 and the Sec1/Munc18-like protein AtVPS45, a
potential regulator of vesicle fusion (Dulubova et al.,
2002; Bryant and James, 2003), is found at the TGN
in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; Bassham and
Raikhel, 1998; Bassham et al., 2000). SNAREs in the

SYP41 complex, along with another SNARE, YKT61/
62, were found to be sufﬁcient for vesicle fusion in
vitro (Chen et al., 2005). Recently, AtVPS45 was
suggested to be involved in the recycling of VSR1, as
RNA interference knockdown of AtVPS45 expression
causes mislocalization of VSR1 (Zouhar et al., 2009).
SYP41 and SYP42 are highly homologous t-SNAREs
with 62% amino acid sequence identity. However,
they form separate complexes with AtVPS45 in dif-
ferent subdomains of the TGN (Bassham et al., 2000)
and are not functionally redundant, as individual syp41
and syp42 knockout mutants are gametophytic lethal
(Sanderfoot et al., 2001b). A mutation in SYP61, another
t-SNARE in the SYP41 complex (Zhu et al., 2002),
caused defects in osmotic stress tolerance and abscisic
acid regulation of stomatal responses. The v-SNARE
VTI12 is involved in trafﬁcking of storage proteins
(Sanmartı´n et al., 2007) and a vti12 mutant showed an
early-senescence phenotype under starvation condi-
tions, suggesting that VTI12 is also involved in the
autophagy pathway for the degradation of cellular con-
tents (Surpin et al., 2003). In addition to their function
together in vesicle fusion, components of the SYP41
complex therefore also appear to be involved in distinct
processes, suggesting that they may function in addi-
tional SNARE complexes.
In this study, we identiﬁed a novel SYP41-interact-
ing protein that we named TNO1 (for TGN-localized
SYP41-interacting protein). TNO1 is a membrane pro-
tein at the TGN and is required for efﬁcient vacuolar
trafﬁcking, consistent with the hypothesis that it func-
tions together with the SYP41 SNARE complex. A tno1
knockout mutant has a salt and osmotic stress-sensitive
phenotype, possibly due to the partial mislocalization
of SYP61. A brefeldin A (BFA)-treated tno1 mutant
showed a delay in formation of the BFA compartment,
indicating that TNO1 could be important in TGN/
endosome fusion events. We propose that TNO1 is
involved in vacuolar trafﬁcking and salt stress resis-
tance by facilitating the vesicle fusion process.
RESULTS
Identiﬁcation of TNO1
SYP41 is a t-SNARE at the TGN that is required for
vesicle fusion in Arabidopsis and forms a complex with
VTI12, SYP61, and AtVPS45 (Bassham and Raikhel,
2000; Chen et al., 2005). To identify additional SYP41-
interacting proteins, detergent-solubilized membrane
extracts of Arabidopsis suspension cells were immu-
noprecipitated using SYP41 antibody. Proteins that
coimmunoprecipitated with SYP41, or with preimmune
antibody as a control, were separated by SDS-PAGE
and visualized by silver staining. Four bands corre-
sponding to proteins migrating at approximately 200,
67, 35, and 15 kD were found only in the SYP41
precipitate and were not present in the SYP41 preim-
mune precipitate, suggesting that they speciﬁcally in-
teracted with SYP41 (Fig. 1A).
The 200-, 67-, 35-, and 15-kD bands were analyzed by
tandem mass spectrometry, comparing the fragmenta-
tion patterns with the predicted Arabidopsis proteome.
The 67- and 15-kD bands were identiﬁed as AtVPS45
and a degradation product of SYP61, respectively
(Sanderfoot et al., 2001a). The 35-kD band contained
SYP41, SYP42, and also SYP43, an additional protein in
the SYP4 family that has not yet been characterized.
Nine peptides from the 200-kD band (Supplemental
Fig. S1B, blue bars) could be matched to the predicted
protein encoded by At1g24460, corresponding to 5.2%
amino acid coverage, and the protein was named TNO1.
A cDNA corresponding to the open reading frame of
TNO1 was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR.
A comparison of the sequence of this cDNA with the
sequence in The Arabidopsis Information Resource re-
vealed the presence of an additional 63 bp (from 4,190 to
4,252; Supplemental Fig. S1A), suggesting the presence
of an extra exon in our TNO1 sequence (Supplemental
Fig. S1B, red bar) and that either the predicted sequence
in The Arabidopsis Information Resource has incorrectly
predicted splice sites or multiple splice variants exist.
TNO1, a previously uncharacterized protein of predicted
mass 209 kD, was predicted to have six coiled-coil
domains in the Arabi-Coil database (Rose et al., 2004)
based on the MultiCoil algorithm (Wolf et al., 1997) and

one transmembrane domain at the extreme C terminus
by TopPred transmembrane prediction (Supplemental
Fig. S2; von Heijne, 1992; Claros and von Heijne, 1994).
To conﬁrm that the approximately 200-kD band in the
SYP41 precipitate corresponds to TNO1, SYP41 and
preimmune immunoprecipitates were analyzed by im-
munoblotting using antibodies against SYP41 or TNO1
(see below). TNO1 was detected in the SYP41 precipitate
but not in the preimmune precipitate, conﬁrming the
correct identiﬁcation of the 200-kD band (Fig. 1B).
To investigate the expression pattern of TNO1, RT-PCR
was performed using RNA extracted from different
Arabidopsis plant organs. TNO1 was ubiquitously ex-
pressed in roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, and
ﬂowers, with lower expression in stems. SYP41 also
showed highest expression in ﬂowers and lowest
expression in stems (Fig. 1C). Expression of TNO1 in
Arabidopsis plant organs and throughout develop-
ment was also analyzed using Genevestigator, a data-
base and Web browser data-mining interface for
Affymetrix GeneChip data (Hruz et al., 2008). The
broad expression pattern observed was consistent
with the RT-PCR results, with TNO1 found to be
highly expressed during germination, ﬂower develop-
ment, and silique maturation (Supplemental Fig. S3).
This expression pattern suggests that TNO1 may have
an important role throughout the plant, particularly
during reproductive stages.
TNO1 Is a TGN-Localized Membrane Protein
To study the function of TNO1, an antibody was
raised against a 66-kD fragment from the C terminus of
TNO1. The speciﬁcity of afﬁnity-puriﬁed TNO1 anti-
body was tested by immunoblotting against total cell
extract, total membrane, and total soluble proteins from
2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings. Puriﬁed TNO1 an-
tibody speciﬁcally recognized a band of approximately
200 kD in Arabidopsis extracts (Fig. 2A) that was not
detected by the preimmune serum (Fig. 2B).
To investigate the potential membrane association of
TNO1, the presence of TNO1 in membrane fractions
was analyzed. An Arabidopsis suspension cell extract
was centrifuged sequentially at 20,000g and 100,000g,
producing three different fractions, P20 (pellet at
20,000g), P100 (pellet at 100,000g), and S (supernatant
from 100,000g). These fractions were analyzed by
immunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP61 antibodies.
The integral membrane protein SYP61 was detected
strongly in all membrane fractions and was not present
in the soluble fraction. TNO1 was also present in all the
membrane fractions but not in the soluble fraction,
suggesting that TNO1 is associated with membranes
(Fig. 2C). The band present above the TNO1 band in the
P20 fraction corresponds to the top of the gel, where
occasionally some aggregated protein is seen.
To determine the mode of association of TNO1 with
membranes, total membrane fractions were isolated
from 2-week-old seedlings and treated with 1% (v/v)
Triton X-100, 2 M urea, 1 M NaCl, or 0.1 M Na2CO3,
followed by repelleting of nonsolubilized proteins.
Immunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies
indicated that SYP41, an integral membrane protein
control, was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and that
TNO1 was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and par-
tially by 2 M urea (Fig. 2D) but not by 1 M NaCl or 0.1 M
Na2CO3. This suggests that TNO1 is a membrane-
integrated protein, consistent with the transmem-
brane domain prediction of a C-terminal membrane
anchor.
To analyze TNO1 subcellular localization, immuno-
ﬂuorescence microscopy was performed and TNO1
labeling compared with that of known markers. Coty-
ledons of wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings (see
below) were immunolabeled using puriﬁed TNO1 an-
tibody to conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of TNO1 labeling. In
wild-type seedlings, TNO1 antibody labeled endoge-
nous TNO1 in punctate structures, while no speciﬁc
signal was observed in the cotyledons of tno1 mutant
seedlings (Fig. 3A), conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of the
antibody. In addition, omission of the ﬁrst antibody,
second antibody, and both ﬁrst and second antibodies
was tested as controls for nonspeciﬁc staining or cross-
talk between different ﬂuorescence channels. No spe-
ciﬁc ﬂuorescence was observed in any of the controls
(data not shown).
Puriﬁed TNO1 antibody was then used to label en-
dogenous TNO1 in VHAa1-GFP (Dettmer et al., 2006),
truncated ST-GFP (Boevink et al., 1998), or RHA1-yellow
ﬂuorescent protein (YFP; Preuss et al., 2004) transgenic
Arabidopsis seedlings, which label TGN, Golgi, and
PVC, respectively. VHAa1-GFP, RHA1-YFP, and ST-GFP
all exhibited a dot-like pattern in cotyledons, and TNO1-

ation test. Total membrane pellets from Arabidopsis seedlings were

solubilized fractions (S) and insoluble fractions (P), which were ana-
lyzed by immunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies.

labeled structures completely overlapped with VHAa1-
labeled structures but were distinct from those labeled
with ST-GFP or RHA1-YFP (Fig. 3, B–D). This result
indicates that TNO1 localizes to the TGN.
Identiﬁcation of the tno1 Knockout Mutant
To analyze the function of TNO1, we obtained a
knockout mutant containing a T-DNA insertion in the
TNO1 gene. A homozygous mutant was identiﬁed by
PCR of genomic DNA using TNO1 gene-speciﬁc
primers (LP and RP) and a T-DNA left border primer
(LBa1) in three combinations (Fig. 4A). A 900-bp
fragment corresponding to the intact TNO1 gene could
be ampliﬁed from genomic DNA of wild-type plants
using LP and RP primers. This band was absent from
the tno1 mutant due to gene disruption by the T-DNA.
PCR using LBa1 and LP or RP primers generated 450-
bp bands, showing the existence of a T-DNA insertion
in the tno1 mutant. This indicates that the tno1 mutant
has a complex insertion in its third exon, as T-DNA
left border sequences are present at both ends of
the insertion (Fig. 4, A and B). Lack of TNO1 protein
expression was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting of total
protein extracts from wild-type and tno1 mutant
plants using afﬁnity-puriﬁed TNO1 antibodies (Fig.
4C). No difference in overall morphology or develop-
ment was seen between tno1 mutant and wild-type
plants grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium
or soil throughout their life cycle.
tno1 Mutant Plants Are Sensitive to Salt and
Osmotic Stress
SYP61/OSM1, a t-SNARE in the SYP41 complex, has
been reported to be involved in general salt/osmotic
stress responses (Zhu et al., 2002). As TNO1 also
interacts with SYP41, TNO1 was hypothesized to be
involved in similar stress responses. Therefore, the
sensitivity of homozygous tno1 mutant plants to salt,
ionic, and osmotic stresses was tested. Wild-type and
tno1 mutant seedlings were grown on MS solid me-
dium for 5 d and transferred to MS solid medium
containing 130 mM NaCl (Fig. 5, C and G), 140 mM KCl
(Fig. 5, D and H), 17 mM LiCl (Fig. 5, E and I), or 300
mM mannitol (Fig. 5, F and J), and root length was
measured after 4 and 8 d. Under normal growth
conditions, tno1 and wild-type seedlings were indis-
tinguishable (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, tno1 mutant
seedlings exhibited shorter roots and earlier leaf chlo-
rosis than wild-type seedlings under Na+, K+, Li+,
and nonionic osmotic stresses. This result shows that
lack of TNO1 causes sensitivity to salt and osmotic
stresses.
To conﬁrm that the observed phenotype of the
tno1 mutant is due to disruption of the TNO1 gene, a

genomic fragment of TNO1 including the native pro-
moter was introduced into the tno1 mutant. TNO1
expression was restored to approximately wild-type
levels in the tno1/TNO1 promoter::TNO1 lines as de-
termined by immunoblotting using TNO1 antibody
(Fig. 4D). This TNO1 genomic fragment complemented
the salt-, ionic-, and osmotic-sensitive phenotype of the
tno1 mutant (Fig. 5).
To test whether the expression of salt or osmotic
stress-responsive genes was altered in the tno1 mutant,
expression of TNO1, SYP61, and known salt (SALT
OVERLY SENSITIVE1 [SOS1]) or osmotic (RD29 and
DRE-BINDING PROTEIN [DREB2A]) stress-respon-
sive genes was analyzed by RT-PCR. TNO1 was ex-
pressed at a basal level in the nontreated condition,
and its mRNA level increased slightly during NaCl
and KCl treatment, while no expression of TNO1 was
detected in the tno1 mutant, as expected (Supplemen-
tal Fig. S4). An increase in the transcript level of SYP61
was observed in both wild-type and tno1 mutant plants
in all stress conditions. SOS1, DREB2A, and RD29 in-
creased as expected (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki,
1993b; Liu et al., 1998; Qiu et al., 2004), and no dif-
ference between wild-type and tno1 mutant plants was
observed (Supplemental Fig. S4). This result suggests
that the phenotype of the tno1 mutant is not caused by
disruption of the expression of genes involved in salt
or osmotic stress responses.
SYP61 Is Partially Mislocalized in the tno1 Mutant
TNO1 interacts with the SYP41 complex, and the
tno1 mutant has a phenotype similar to that of the
syp61 mutant. Thus, we hypothesized that a mutation
in TNO1 may affect components of the SYP41 com-
plex. The localization of SYP61 and SYP41 was inves-
tigated in wild-type and tno1 mutant protoplasts.
Previously, SYP61 has been shown to colocalize with
VHAa1-GFP (Dettmer et al., 2006). To investigate the
localization of SYP61 in the tno1 mutant, a VHAa1-GFP
transgenic tno1 mutant was generated. Immunoﬂuores-
cence analysis was performed using protoplasts gener-
ated from VHAa1-GFP transgenic wild-type and tno1
mutant plants, and the percentage colocalization (SYP61-
labeled
structures
overlapping
with
VHAa1/total
SYP61-labeled structures) was analyzed in ImageJ
(Abramoff et al., 2004) using the colocalization ﬁnder
plugin. In wild-type protoplasts, 70% of SYP61 colo-
calized with VHAa1-GFP, while 47% of SYP61 was
found to colocalize with VHAa1-GFP in the tno1
mutant protoplasts (Fig. 6). This difference was statis-
tically signiﬁcant (t test, P = 0.00011; n = 17). When
colocalization of SYP41 with VHAa1-GFP was com-
pared between the wild type and the tno1 mutant, no
difference was observed (Fig. 6), suggesting that loss
of TNO1 speciﬁcally affects the localization of SYP61
and not SYP41.
Lack of TNO1 Causes the Secretion of Vacuolar Proteins
Disruption of vacuolar transport typically leads to
the secretion of vacuolar proteins by a default pathway
(Shimada et al., 1997, 2003a). Previously, disruption of
either of the SYP41-interacting proteins, AtVPS45 or
VTI12, was shown to cause the secretion of aleurain
and of a vacuolar marker consisting of CLAVATA3
fused to the vacuolar sorting signal from barley
(Hordeum vulgare) lectin (Sanmartı´n et al., 2007; Zouhar
et al., 2009). Therefore, we hypothesized that lack
of TNO1 may also cause the secretion of vacuolar
proteins.
To test the potential involvement of TNO1 in vac-
uolar trafﬁcking, we compared the amount of the

from LBa1 and either LP or RP primers. C, Lack of TNO1 in the tno1

wild-type and tno1 mutant plants, suggesting that
overall vacuolar trafﬁcking is not inhibited in the tno1
mutant (Fig. 7A).
Although the tno1 mutant does not appear to have a
general block in vacuolar trafﬁcking, this does not
preclude a mild or partial disruption in this pathway,
as seen in a vti12 mutant (Sanmartı´n et al., 2007). Thus,
intercellular wash ﬂuid (ICF) was collected from leaves
of wild-type and tno1 mutant plants to determine
whether any vacuolar proteins were partially secreted
(Neuhaus et al., 1991). Proteins in the ICF were ana-
lyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against
AALP, RD21, and invertase, with the cytoplasmic pro-
teins ChlI (stromal) and PEX11d (peroxisomal) used as
controls to rule out differences in cell breakage between
mutant and wild-type plants. AALP, RD21, and inver-
tase bands in ICF-depleted leaf extract showed no
difference between the wild type and the tno1 mutant,
as expected from the above results with isolated vacu-
oles. However, the tno1 mutant had increased levels of
AALP and RD21 in the ICF compared with wild-type
plants, suggesting that lack of TNO1 caused some
secretion of AALP and RD21 (Fig. 7B). By contrast, no
secretion of vacuolar invertase was observed, although
vacuolar invertase was suggested previously to be
transported to the vacuole by a similar pathway to
RD21 (Rojo et al., 2003). RD21, therefore, may have an
alternative or additional transport pathway to the vac-
uole. These data suggest that TNO1 is required for
efﬁcient trafﬁcking of some vacuolar proteins.
Involvement of TNO1 in Vesicle Fusion
In Arabidopsis, the trafﬁcking inhibitor BFA targets
the Arf-GEF GNOM and induces the formation of BFA
compartments (Geldner et al., 2001), most likely by
homotypic fusion of the TGN (which is also an early
endosome) and heterotypic fusion between the TGN
and other endosomes (Dettmer et al., 2006; Lam et al.,
2009; Viotti et al., 2010). Therefore, SNAREs at the TGN
mayfunction in these fusion events upon BFA treat-
ment. As TNO1 interacts with SYP41 and loss of TNO1

disrupts the localization of SYP61, TNO1 could be
involved in membrane fusion at the TGN together
with the SYP41 complex.
Therefore, formation of the BFA compartment in
VHAa1-GFP transgenic wild-type and tno1 mutant
seedlings was investigated. Without BFA treatment,
there was no difference in the appearance of VHAa1-
GFP-positive structures in roots and cotyledons
between wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings (Fig. 8,
A–D). After 1 h of BFA treatment, VHAa1-GFP accu-
mulated in the BFA compartments in roots of wild-
type seedlings, as reported previously, and in tno1
mutant seedlings (Fig. 8, E and F; Dettmer et al., 2006).
In wild-type cotyledons, the BFA compartments were
seen in the peripheral region. By contrast, VHAa1-GFP
in tno1 mutant cotyledons did not accumulate in BFA
compartments after 1 h of BFA treatment (Fig. 8, G and
H). VHAa1-GFP-labeled BFA compartments in coty-
ledons of the tno1 mutant could be seen only after 5 h
of BFA treatment (Fig. 8K). No difference was seen in
recovery from BFA treatment between wild-type and
tno1 mutant plants (Fig. 8, I and J).
The response of TNO1 to BFA treatment was also
investigated. VHAa1-GFP transgenic seedlings were
treated in MS liquid medium supplemented with 50 mM
BFA for 2 h, followed by ﬁxing and immunolabeling
using TNO1 antibody. TNO1 was not found in the
VHAa1-GFP-labeled BFA compartment but instead
remained in small punctate structures similar to those
in the absence of BFA. After BFA treatment, TNO1
colocalized with the remaining small VHAa1-GFP-
labeled structures (Fig. 8, L–O), suggesting that TNO1
is present in TGN remnants that do not undergo fusion.
Together, these results suggest that lack of TNO1
delays homotypic fusion between TGN or fusion be-
tween TGN and other endosomes in cotyledons. The
BFA compartment, therefore, forms more slowly in the
tno1 mutant, presumably due to delayed fusion. TNO1
may function in maintaining TGN structure or iden-
tity, marking TGN remnants that do not participate in
BFA compartment formation.
DISCUSSION
Identity of TNO1
TNO1 was identiﬁed as a novel protein that coim-
munoprecipitates with SYP41. As SYP41 is a t-SNARE
residing at the TGN, we hypothesize that TNO1 may
also be involved in vesicle fusion at this organelle. We
have demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in salt and
osmotic stress responses and is required for efﬁcient
vacuolar trafﬁcking. Based on the effects of BFA treat-
ment, TNO1 is proposed to be involved in the forma-
tion of the BFA compartment and may function in
maintaining TGN structure or identity.

Role of TNO1 in Vesicle Trafﬁcking
Plant Physiol. Vol. 156, 2011

Tool, two previously characterized domains (SMC_
prok_B and SMC_N) containing long coiled-coil re-
gions for protein interaction were identiﬁed in TNO1
(Akhmedov et al., 1998; Geer et al., 2002). Although
SMC domains are commonly found in structural main-
tenance of chromosome proteins, they are also found
in other proteins with multiple coiled-coil domains,
such as vesicle-tethering factors and cytoskeleton-
binding proteins. A search for proteins with sequence
similarity to TNO1 using the BLASTalgorithm (Altschul
et al., 1997, 2005) identiﬁed several hypothetical pro-
teins from other plant species as most closely related to
TNO1. In addition, myosin-related proteins, a putative
ATP-binding protein, and tethering factors including
USO1 in yeast, tgolgin-1 in mouse, and gigantin in
human were identiﬁed with high signiﬁcance, primar-
ily due to the presence of long coiled-coil regions in
these proteins.
USO1, which has 20% amino acid sequence identity
and 39% amino acid similarity to TNO1, is a tethering
factor involved in ER-to-Golgi trafﬁcking that tethers
COPII vesicles at the cis-Golgi (Cao et al., 1998).
Tethering factors have been reported to function in
vesicle fusion by interacting with their tethering part-
ner to pull vesicles close to their target membrane (Cao
et al., 1998). Some are also involved in maintaining
organelle structure and assisting in the formation of
SNARE complexes via direct interaction with a SNARE
(Shorter et al., 2002; Vasile et al., 2003). The presence of
multiple predicted coiled-coil domains and the similar-
ity to USO1 suggest that TNO1 could be a tethering
factor at the TGN.
Phenotype of the tno1 Knockout Mutant
To determine the function of TNO1, the tno1 mutant
was isolated and four major phenotypes were identi-
ﬁed: sensitivity to high salt and osmotic stress, partial
secretion of some vacuolar proteins, mislocalization
of SYP61, and delayed BFA compartment formation
in cotyledon cells. Differing effects on salt tolerance
have been seen for mutations in different trafﬁcking
proteins. Knockdown of AtVAMP7C, a v-SNARE in-
volved in vesicle fusion with the vacuole, was found to
confer salt tolerance by preventing hydrogen peroxide-
containing vesicles from fusing with the tonoplast
(Leshem et al., 2006). Knockout of SYP22, a t-SNARE
in the PVC and tonoplast, also increased salt tolerance
in shoots, and a decreased level of Na+ in shoots was
observed (Hamaji et al., 2009). Thus, vesicle fusion
appears to directly or indirectly affect salt tolerance at
the PVC and vacuoles. By contrast, the tno1 mutant
and a mutation in SYP61 (Zhu et al., 2002) showed a
salt-sensitive phenotype. TNO1 and SYP61 colocalize
to the TGN and are likely to exist in the same protein
complex. The salt-sensitive phenotype of the tno1
mutant may be due to its effect on SYP61 (Fig. 6). In
the tno1 mutant, less SYP61 colocalized with VHAa1-
GFP-labeled TGN compared with wild-type plants,
leading to possible reduced SYP61 function in salt
tolerance. It was hypothesized that a cation trans-
porter in the osm1/syp61 mutant may not function
correctly, affecting guard cell turgor and salt sensitiv-
ity (Zhu et al., 2002). Extensive investigations of cation
transporters in yeast, plants, and mammalian cells
have shown that cation/H+ antiporters in the Golgi,
TGN, endosome, and PVC regulate the pH and cation
concentration in these organelles, affecting vesicle
trafﬁcking, and knockdown of VHAa1 in Arabidopsis
also leads to increased salt sensitivity (Brett et al., 2002,
2005; Nakamura et al., 2005; Pardo et al., 2006; Fuji
et al., 2007; Krebs et al., 2010). Thus, one possibility is
that the salt-sensitive phenotype of the tno1 and osm1/
syp61 mutants could be caused by defects in the

transport of cation/H+ antiporters or in the function of
cation/H+ antiporters at the TGN.
Another noticeable phenotype is the secretion of
normally vacuolar proteins in the tno1 mutant. Anal-
ysis of ICF from the tno1 mutant demonstrated partial
secretion of AALP, in common with mutants in the
additional SYP41 complex components VPS45 and
VTI12 (Sanmartı´n et al., 2007; Zouhar et al., 2009).
AALP has dual vacuolar targeting signals and is a
cargo for VSR1 (Hinz et al., 2007). Therefore, TNO1,
AtVPS45, and VTI12 may cooperate in VSR1-mediated
vacuolar trafﬁcking via recycling of VSR1 from PVC to
TGN. RD21 is another protein that is partially secreted
in the tno1 mutant. RD21 is a Cys protease like AALP
but is probably transported via a VSR1-independent
pathway. RD21 and invertase are transported to the
vacuole by ER bodies rather than by the VSR1-medi-
ated transport pathway (Hayashi et al., 2001; Rojo
et al., 2003); however, invertase was not secreted in the
tno1 mutant. This result may indicate that RD21 can
follow an alternative transport pathway to the vacu-
ole. Protein proﬁles from isolated vacuoles of wild-
type and tno1 mutant leaf protoplasts were compared
by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but no signif-
icant differences were observed (data not shown). This
is most likely due to only a small fraction of proteins
being secreted, with most protein still being correctly
transported to the vacuole. The partial secretion of
vacuolar proteins, therefore, may be an indirect effect
of the loss of TNO1.
Although salt sensitivity and secretion of some
vacuolar proteins in the tno1 mutant may appear to be
independent phenotypes, these two phenotypes are
closely related. A connection between salt sensitivity
and vacuolar trafﬁcking has been well established. In
yeast and mammalian cells, post-Golgi organelles
involved in vacuolar trafﬁcking were shown to be
targets for salt stress, resulting in inefﬁcient vacuolar
trafﬁcking (Bachert et al., 2001; Pardo et al., 2006;
Herna´ndez et al., 2009). In Arabidopsis, the endocytic
pathway to the vacuole has also been shown to be
important for salt tolerance (Leshem et al., 2006,
2007). Thus, our results provide additional evidence
that vacuolar trafﬁcking is important for salt toler-
ance.
BFA Treatment
In this study, we used BFA to investigate the in-
volvement of TNO1 in fusion events, as TNO1 is a
member of a protein complex predicted to be required
for membrane fusion at the TGN and BFA treatment
causes the formation of BFA compartments by fusion
between multiple types of endosomes. As expected,
VHAa1-GFP transgenic plants formed BFA compart-
ments after 1 h of BFA treatment, but VHAa1-GFP
transgenic tno1 mutant plants showed formation of
BFA compartments only after 5 h of BFA treatment in
cotyledon cells, while mutant root cells behaved iden-
tically to wild-type cells in this assay. This delay in
BFA compartment formation implies that TNO1 could
be involved in homotypic fusion of the TGN/early
endosomes or fusion between TGN and other types of
endosomes upon BFA treatment.
VHAa1-GFP and TNO1 colocalize extensively un-
der normal conditions; however, loss of colocalization
was observed upon BFA treatment, indicating that
TNO1 does not enter BFA compartments (Fig. 8). A
similar effect was observed for the mammalian golgin
GM130, which, unlike most Golgi proteins, does not
relocate to the ER in the presence of BFA (Seemann
et al., 2000). GM130 is a tethering factor that also
interacts with SNAREs during vesicle fusion and a
Golgi matrix protein required for the integrity of the
Golgi structure (Diao et al., 2008). After BFA treatment,
GM130 remains in a Golgi remnant, while Golgi lu-
minal proteins are transported back to the ER, indi-
cating that GM130 is involved in maintaining Golgi
structure (Seemann et al., 2000). Although there is no
sequence homology between TNO1 and GM130, based
on the properties of TNO1, it is possible that TNO1
also functions as a tethering factor and is involved in
maintaining TGN structure or identity. In vitro fusion
assays using recombinant TNO1 and TGN SNAREs
may provide insight into the role of TNO1 in mem-
brane fusion events.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Identiﬁcation of TNO1
Protein extracts were made essentially as described by Bassham et al.
(2000) and Sanderfoot et al. (2001a). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
suspension cells were ground in extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered
saline [PBS], 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and 1%
[v/v] Triton X-100) and solubilized for 2 h at 4C. Solubilized proteins were
added to a column containing immobilized SYP41 antibodies or SYP41
preimmune serum and incubated for 2 h at 4C. The columns were washed
ﬁve times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted using 0.2 M
Gly, pH 2.5. Immunoprecipitates from SYP41 and preimmune antibody
were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using silver staining.
Protein bands migrating at approximate molecular masses of 200, 67,
35, and 15 kD were excised and analyzed at the Protein Microsequencing
and Proteomic Mass Spectroscopy Laboratory at the University of Mas-
sachusetts Medical School (Worchester, MA). Proteins were digested in gel
using trypsin, the resulting peptides were applied to a Finnigan Electro-
spray LCQ Deca ion-trap mass spectrometer, and the peptide masses were
used to identify potential matches within the Arabidopsis proteome.
cDNA Cloning and Sequencing
RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis siliques and treated with DNase I,
followed by RT using an oligo(dT) primer. cDNAs were ampliﬁed using
Herculase Long and Accurate Polymerase Mix (Agilent Technologies) and
TNO1 cDNA forward and reverse primers (Table I) according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The ampliﬁcation product was inserted into pGEM T-Easy
vector (Invitrogen), and DNA sequencing was performed at the W.M. Keck
Foundation (Yale University). The sequence was deposited in GenBank
(accession no. HM776995).
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions
Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) seeds were surface sterilized and grown
on soil or MS Vitamin and Salt Mixture (Caisson Laboratories) solid medium

containing 1% (w/v) Suc. A tno1 knockout mutant line (Salk_112503) that has
a T-DNA insertion in the third exon was obtained from the Arabidopsis
Biological Resource Center. A homozygous tno1 mutant was identiﬁed by PCR
using TNO1 internal forward and reverse primers and T-DNA left border-a1
primer (Table I).
Generation of Transgenic Plants
GFP-fused vacuolar H+-ATPase (GFP-VHAa1) plasmid (Dettmer et al.,
2006) was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV2260, which was
used to transform tno1 mutant plants by the ﬂoral dipping method (Clough
and Bent, 1998). The resulting VHAa1-GFP-transformed tno1 plants were
selected on MS solid medium containing 50 mg mL21 kanamycin.
For tno1 mutant complementation, the full-length TNO1 gene and its pro-
moter were separately ampliﬁed by PCR with TNO1 promoter primers and
genomic TNO1 primers with corresponding restriction sites (Table I). The TNO1
promoter fragment was digested using SalI and NotI, and the TNO1 genomic
fragment was digested using NotI and KpnI. The digested TNO1 promoter and
genomic DNA were ligated into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300MCS1 digested
using SalI and KpnI (Sanderfoot et al., 2001a). The resulting plasmid was
introduced into A. tumefaciens strain GV2260, which was used to transform
tno1 mutant plants. The transgenic tno1 mutant plants were identiﬁed by
resistance to 50 mg mL21 hygromycin and immunoblotting with TNO1 antibody.
RT-PCR Analysis of TNO1, SYP41, and Salt/Osmotic
Stress-Responsive Genes
Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis organs using the TRIzol
RNA isolation method (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/portals/masc/AFGC/
RevisedAFGC/site2RnaL.htm#isolation). Roots were harvested from 4-week-
old Arabidopsis plants grown in liquid culture (MS plus 1% [w/v] Suc), and
stems, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, ﬂowers, and siliques were harvested from
7-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown in soil. Extracted RNA was treated with
DNase I, followed by RTusing an oligo(dT) primer. cDNAs were ampliﬁed for
25 cycles using TNO1 internal forward and reverse primers or SYP41 forward
and reverse primers (Table I).
One-week-old wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings were treated with
300 mM NaCl, 40 mM LiCl, 300 mM KCl, or 600 mM mannitol for 5 h. Total RNA
was extracted from the seedlings, and expression of SOS1, DREB2A, RD29,
TNO1, and SYP61 was analyzed by RT-PCR using gene-speciﬁc primers (Table I;
Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1993a; Liu et al., 1998; Shi et al., 2000; Zhu
et al., 2002).
Antibody Production and Puriﬁcation
A 1.7-kb C-terminal fragment of the TNO1 cDNAwas cloned into pET28b(+)
expression vector (Novagen) to produce a His-partial TNO1 fusion construct.
The fusion protein construct was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and
expression and puriﬁcation of partial TNO1 were as described by Bassham et al.
(2000). The partial TNO1 was puriﬁed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose
and used to immunize rabbits at Cocalico Biologicals after gel puriﬁcation.
For puriﬁcation of TNO1-speciﬁc antibodies, puriﬁed His-tagged TNO1
protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane
followed by staining with Ponceau S, and the strip containing the fusion protein
was cut out. The strip was blocked in 3% (w/v) dried nonfat milk in PBS, and
crude rabbit serum was incubated with the strip for 2 h at 4C. The strip was
washed ﬁve times with PBS, and antibodies were eluted using 0.1 M Gly, pH 2.2.
Differential Centrifugation
Arabidopsis plants were homogenized in 0.3 M Suc, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride. The homogenate was
centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min at 4C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was
centrifuged at 20,000g, then the supernatant was removed and further centri-
fuged at 100,000g. The TCA-precipitated supernatant after centrifugation at
100,000g and pellets after centrifugation at 20,000g and 100,000g were analyzed
by immunoblotting with TNO1 and SYP61 antibodies (Sanderfoot et al., 2001a).
Extraction of TNO1 from Membranes
Total membrane fractions were isolated from 2-week-old seedlings by
centrifugation at 125,000g and treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 M urea, 1 M
NaCl, or 0.1 M Na2CO3 followed by pelleting of nonsolubilized proteins at
125,000g (Phan et al., 2008). Pellets and TCA-precipitated supernatants were
analyzed by immunoblotting with TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies.
ICF Extraction
ICF was extracted as described (Neuhaus et al., 1991). One gram of
Arabidopsis leaves was inﬁltrated under vacuum in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH
5.5. After inﬁltration, surface dried leaves were rolled with ﬁlter paper and
inserted into a 10-mL syringe. The syringe was inserted into a 50-mL conical
tube, which was centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min at 10C. ICF was collected in
the bottom of the tube, and ICF-depleted leaves after centrifugation were
ground in 50 mM sodium citrate for the control. ICF and ICF-depleted protein
extract were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-AALP (1:1,000; Ahmed
et al., 2000), anti-RD21 (1:1,000; Hayashi et al., 2001), anti-invertase (1:3,000;
Rojo et al., 2003), anti-ChlI (1:2,000; Adhikari et al., 2009), and anti-PEX11d
(1:1,000; Orth et al., 2007).
Preparation of Vacuoles
Leaf protoplasts were generated as described (Sheen, 2002). After harvest-
ing protoplasts, vacuole isolation was performed as described (Robert et al.,
2007). After adding 6 mL of prewarmed lysis buffer (0.2 M mannitol, 10%
[w/v] Ficoll, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM Na phosphate, pH 8.0) at 42C, lysed
protoplasts were transferred to clear tubes for a SW41 swinging-bucket rotor
(Beckman-Coulter) and overlaid with 3 mL of 4% (w/v) Ficoll (by mixing lysis
and vacuole buffer) and 1 mL of vacuole buffer (0.45 M mannitol, 2 mM EDTA,
and 5 mM Na phosphate, pH 7.5) followed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for
50 min at 10C. Vacuoles were recovered from the interface between 4% (w/v)
Ficoll and vacuole buffer.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Three- or 4-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on MS solid medium were
immunolabeled with a protocol slightly modiﬁed from Phan et al. (2008).
Seedlings used were ST-GFP transgenic plants (Boevink et al., 1998), VHAa1-
GFP transgenic plants (Dettmer et al., 2006), and RHA1-YFP transgenic plants
(Preuss et al., 2004) to label Golgi, TGN, and PVC, respectively.
For protoplast immunoﬂuorescence, protoplasts were ﬁxed in 3% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde in MTSB (50 mM PIPES-KOH, pH 6.9, 5 mM EGTA, and
5 mM MgSO4) with 0.4 M sorbitol for 30 min and washed twice with MTSB with
0.4 M sorbitol. Fixed protoplasts were mounted onto slides and dried for 1 h.
Protoplasts were permeabilized using permeabilization buffer (0.5% [v/v]
Nonidet P-40 and 10% [v/v] dimethyl sulfoxide in MTSB) for 30 min in a
moist chamber followed by washing three times using MTSB. Samples were
blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in MTSB for 2 h, and primary
antibodies in 3% (w/v) BSA in MTSB were added. After 3 h of incubation,
protoplasts were washed three times using MTSB and treated with conjugated
secondary antibody in 3% (w/v) BSA in MTSB for 50 min followed by
washing ﬁve times with MTSB. Anti-TNO1 (1:25), anti-SYP41 (1:50), and anti-
SYP61 (1:50) were used as primary antibodies. AlexaFluor 594-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250) was used as secondary antibody.
Fluorescent signals were viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope
(Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems). Excitation and emission wavelengths of GFP
were 488 and 500 nm and those of AlexaFluor 594 were 590 and 600 nm,
respectively.
Salt, Ionic, and Osmotic Stresses and Drug Treatment
For stress treatment, seedlings were grown on MS solid medium for 5 d
and transferred to MS solid medium containing 130 mM NaCl, 17 mM LiCl, 140
mM KCl, or 300 mM mannitol, followed by growth for an additional 10 d (Zhu
et al., 2002).
For BFA treatment, seedlings were grown on MS solid medium for 4 d and
transferred to MS liquid medium containing 50 mM BFA or dimethyl sulfoxide
as carrier control for 5 h. Seedlings were washed twice with MS liquid medium
and incubated in MS liquid medium for recovery. BFA treatment of protoplasts
was performed as above for 2 h with the same concentration of BFA.
