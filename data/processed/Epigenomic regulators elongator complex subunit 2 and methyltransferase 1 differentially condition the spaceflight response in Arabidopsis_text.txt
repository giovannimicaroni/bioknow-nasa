Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceﬂight show
transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress
responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to
those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceﬂight
physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression
experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceﬂight adaptation. The
experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated
the spaceﬂight-altered, genome-wide methylation proﬁles of two methylation-regulating
gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)]
along with a wild-type Col-0 control.
Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceﬂight
in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development
of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 plants suffered less, with
their morphology affected by spaceﬂight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0
controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceﬂight were dramatically
different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the
disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceﬂight responses,
especially in elp2-5. Many of the genes comprising the spaceﬂight transcriptome of
each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceﬂight. In Col-0 the majority of
the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceﬂight response, which includes
genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling.
However, the spaceﬂight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns
of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the
DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceﬂight stress response in
the mutants, particularly in elp2-5.

Epigenomic Regulators Condition Spaceﬂight Response
Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceﬂight results in differential
DNA methylation in an organ-speciﬁc manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase
function does not dramatically affect spaceﬂight growth or morphology, yet met1-7
reprograms the spaceﬂight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption
of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceﬂight grown plants, together with a
diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.

INTRODUCTION
Plants cope with environmental changes by reprogramming
gene expression and metabolic processes necessary for growth,
development, and survival (e.g., Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010;
Sewelam et al., 2014; Lopez-Ruiz et al., 2020). The adaptability
of a genotype to changing environmental conditions is therefore
determined by its genome and gene activity, both of which are in
turn inﬂuenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation
(e.g., Dowen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2018). The APEX-04
EPEX spaceﬂight experiment investigated the role of speciﬁc
epigenomic changes in determining the physiological adaptation
of plants to the spaceﬂight environment.
DNA methylation proﬁles within a genome are dynamic and
complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress
responses (reviewed in: Bartels et al., 2018). Many terrestrial
abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water
stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes
that aid in the adaptation process (e.g., Labra et al., 2002;
Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010; Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011;
Bilichak et al., 2012; Colaneri and Jones, 2013; Tricker et al.,
2013; Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015, 2016; Hewezi et al., 2017,
2018; Bartels et al., 2018; Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2018;
Beyrne et al., 2019; Ashapkin et al., 2020; Akhter et al., 2021;
Korotko et al., 2021; Laanen et al., 2021; Villagomez-Aranda
et al., 2021). The genes diﬀerentially expressed in response to
spaceﬂight share similarities with many documented terrestrial
responses. Hallmarks of spaceﬂight responses include diﬀerential
expression of genes involved in pathways associated with cell wall
remodeling, reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen attacks,
wounding, salt stress, drought stress, and hormone signaling
(Hoson et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2008; Salmi and Roux, 2008;
Blancaﬂor, 2013; Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013; Zupanska
et al., 2013; Ferl et al., 2014; Inglis et al., 2014; Nakashima
et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Schüler
et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Ferl and Paul, 2016; Herranz
et al., 2019; Vandenbrink et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020;
Califar et al., 2020; Kruse et al., 2020; Angelos et al., 2021;
Manian et al., 2021b). Plants further respond to spaceﬂight with
changes in DNA methylation, again similarly to the epigenetic
eﬀects that occur during terrestrial stresses. Genome-wide DNA
methylation and gene expression alterations occurred in plants
grown for part of their life cycle in a satellite experiment (Xu
et al., 2018). Arabidopsis grown from seed on orbit in the
International Space Station (ISS) showed changes in speciﬁc DNA
methylation contexts, with some of those changes associated with
diﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs; Zhou et al., 2019).
The patterns of spaceﬂight-associated DNA methylation
are organ-speciﬁc. In comparison to roots, spaceﬂight leaves
show higher methylation levels within the protein-coding genes
compared to ground controls (GCs; Zhou et al., 2019). A large
proportion of the genes that are diﬀerentially expressed and
diﬀerentially methylated are associated with ROS signaling (Zhou
et al., 2019). ROS can act as signaling molecules in responses
to an array of plant stressors and there is growing evidence of
an interplay between ROS metabolism and epigenetic regulation
during acclimation in terrestrial environments (Huang et al.,
2019). DNA methylation and other epigenetic modiﬁcations have
been reported to play a role in regulating the innate immune
response and pathogen response (Dowen et al., 2012; Wang et al.,
2013; Yu et al., 2013; Tameshige et al., 2015; Jarosz et al., 2020).
Many components of the gene networks associated with these
pathogen-associated pathways are also diﬀerentially expressed
by plants in spaceﬂight (Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013,
2017; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Schüler et al.,
2015; Herranz et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020; Califar et al.,
2020; Manian et al., 2021a). This commonality of terrestrial
environmental responses with spaceﬂight responses begged the
question: do plants use similar tools to regulate genes in response
to spaceﬂight?
DNA methylation in plants occurs in three main contexts,
CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, C, or T). Methylation
in each context is directly maintained by a distinct pathway
and set of enzymes which include: Methyltransferase 1 (MET1),
decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1)1, and variant in
methylation in the CG context, SUVH4-deposited H3K9me2
and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) in the CHG context,
and CMT2 in the CHH context (Chevalier et al., 2005;
Hsieh et al., 2012; Pikaard, 2013). In addition to these direct
enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation, a number of genes
indirectly aﬀect DNA methylation through RNA intermediates.
RNA-directed DNA methylation facilitates the recruitment of
DNA methyltransferases. In plants, small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) direct de novo DNA methylation and maintenance
of DNA methylation at asymmetrical CHH sites through the
polymerase II (Pol II)-related RNA polymerases Pol IV and
Pol V (Matzke et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis, the siRNA eﬀector
ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) exists in a complex with domains
rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) for methylation of the
template strand for RNA polymerase V-mediated non-coding

RNA transcripts (Zhong et al., 2014). The Elongator complex is
a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and ELP2 is the most likely subunit
to interact with the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016).
To explore the eﬀects of these two DNA methylation pathways
in conditioning the spaceﬂight response, we chose MET1 as a
representative of the proteins directly involved in methylation
and ELP2 as a model regulator that aﬀects methylation during
stress responses through RNA intermediates and regulation of
methyltransferases.
The cytosine DNA methyl transferase gene, Met1, is
directly involved in the maintenance of cytosine methylation
in Arabidopsis, particularly at CG sites (Kankel et al., 2003;
Rigal et al., 2016). MET1 is one of several methylation
enzymes that also modify the epigenome of plants as part of
stress responses (Naydenov et al., 2015; Yong-Villalobos et al.,
2015; Dhami and Cazzonelli, 2020). The role MET1 plays
in maintaining the CG methylation proﬁle is also important
for the subsequent inheritance of those epigenomic changes
(Saze et al., 2003). Loss of MET1 function non-speciﬁcally
enhances resistance to bacterial infections (Kankel et al., 2003;
Dowen et al., 2012). Many of the genes diﬀerentially regulated
in methylation-mutant met1-3 lines (Supplementary Material,
Dowen et al., 2012) show a substantial overlap with genes
that are diﬀerentially expressed in response to spaceﬂight
(Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019) including genes
involved in defense, transcription, response to hormone stimulus
and phosphorylation. These methylation mutant transcriptome
proﬁles establish that diﬀerential methylation in the genome is
central to facilitating stress responses in Arabidopsis (Dowen
et al., 2012; Zhang, 2012), suggesting the hypothesis that the stress
response elicited by spaceﬂight in Arabidopsis may also have an
epigenetic component that could involve regulation by MET1.
The Elongator complex is composed of six protein subunits
that are highly conserved among eukaryotes; it acts as a co-
factor of RNA Pol II, and has several unique cellular functions,
including tRNA modiﬁcation, DNA modiﬁcation, and histone
acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (Nelissen et al., 2005; Glatt and
Muller, 2013; Ding and Mou, 2015; Kolaj-Robin and Seraphin,
2017). Although loss of any component can compromise
Elongator complex function (Ding and Mou, 2015) the subunits
have independent activity and can also function as sub-complexes
(e.g., Glatt and Muller, 2013; Jarosz et al., 2020). Elongator
proteins were initially identiﬁed in plants as important to
various aspects of growth, development, and immune response
(Woloszynska et al., 2016). Elongator Proteins ELP3 and ELP2
both contribute epigenomic regulation of gene expression in
response to developmental and immune response pathways in
Arabidopsis. ELP3 exhibits HAT activity while ELP2 interacts
with components of the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al.,
2016). In plants, siRNAs can induce cytosine methylation by
recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 through RNA-
directed DNA methylation (e.g., Xie and Yu, 2015), and it is by
this mode of action that ELP2 regulates plant development and
stress responses (reviewed in: Jarosz et al., 2020).
ELP2 is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g.,
Wang et al., 2013) and plays a role in root development (e.g.,
Jia et al., 2015), The role of ELP2 in plant pathogen defense
is relevant to the spaceﬂight response in plants as many of
the genes comprising the spaceﬂight transcriptome are also
commonly associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g.,
Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019; Barker et al., 2020).
Functionally, ELP2 is a regulator of NONEXPRESSOR OF
PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and accelerates
the immune responses in Arabidopsis through epigenetic
modiﬁcation of DNA methylation (DeFraia et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2017). Deletion of the gene
encoding ELP2 has substantial impact on pathogen-induced
transcription (DeFraia et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013; Silva
et al., 2017), and also impacts fundamental processes such
as root development (Jia et al., 2015) and auxin signaling
(Nelissen et al., 2010). Many of the genes diﬀerentially expressed
between elp2 mutants and wild-type plants include hallmarks
of abiotic stress responses (Zhou et al., 2009). Further, many
of the genes diﬀerentially expressed in elp2 mutants are
also represented in Arabidopsis spaceﬂight transcriptomes and
spaceﬂight methylome (e.g., Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou
et al., 2019). These roles for ELP2 in pathogen responses
and abiotic stresses suggest that ELP2 may also play a
role in the epigenetic regulation of the spaceﬂight response
pathways in plants.

in the spaceﬂight response of Arabidopsis. The experiment
was conducted onboard the ISS to evaluate the spaceﬂight
responses of the methylation mutants met1-7 and elp2-5
compared to the Col-0 wild-type background of both mutant
lines. Growth patterns, genome-wide methylation proﬁles, and
diﬀerential gene expression proﬁles were used to develop an
integrated assessment of the interplay of DNA methylation and
transcriptional regulation in the response to spaceﬂight.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Material and Experimental Design
Three lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) were used:
Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild-type (TAIR CS70000), and Col-0
mutants met1-7 and elp2-5 genotype. Mutants met1-7 and elp2-
5 previously described in Kanno et al. (2008), Guo et al.
(2013), Wang et al. (2013), and were kindly provided by Dr.
Zhonglin Mou (Wang et al., 2013). Sterilized seeds from each
line were sown aseptically onto Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm;
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA, United States), containing
50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented
with: 0.5 × Murashige–Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and
1 × Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, and then sealed with breathable
tape (3M Micropore
R⃝, Maplewood, MN, United States; e.g.,
Califar et al., 2020). Seeded plates were prepared to maintain
seed dormancy with a combination of far-red light treatment
and light-tight wrapping in DuvetyneTM cloth until insertion
into Veggie growth facility on orbit. Dormancy preparation

Epigenomic Regulators Condition Spaceﬂight Response
Ten plates (nine for installation in Veggie and one spare) per
genotype for each environmental condition (ﬂight and GC) were
prepared for launch. The plates were stored at 4◦C and remained
dormant until their installation into the Vegetable Production
System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS, and a comparable set
was installed into the Veggie hardware in the ISS environmental
simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy space center. Plants in the
Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber) were
exposed to constant light conditions of 100–135 µmoles/m2s
PAR for 11 days before being harvested into Kennedy space
center ﬁxation tubes (KFTs) and ﬁxed in RNAlaterTM (Ambion,
Grand Island, NY, United States). All of the plants from each
plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then
stowed at −80◦C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The
comparable GC samples were also harvested into KFTs and stored
in a standard −80◦C freezer. All samples were kept frozen until
delivery to the laboratory for analysis. Each plate was intended
as a biological replicate and kept separate in tissue preparation
operations, but the mass values drove the decision to allow a
combination of two plates to comprise a replicate, which resulted
in a total of four biological replicates for each of the genotypes
and treatments for the analyses. Leaf and root tissues from each
sample were dissected using an Olympus stereo-microscope.
FromBioanalyzer and quantiﬁed with the each plate, the materials
from three individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and
transcriptome analyses, and materials from 10 to 15 individual
plants from that same plate were allocated for DNA extraction.
Molecular analyses were performed on leaf and root tissues
dissected from each of the three genotypes. One plate was lost,
(met1-7, spaceﬂight C6) and so one of the spaceﬂight met1-7
replicates was composed of plants from a single plate rather
than two plates. Whole-genome bisulﬁte sequencing (WGBS)
was performed for the methylome analysis and RNA sequencing
(RNASeq) for the transcriptome analysis. To summarize, for
each genotype under each environmental condition, a total seven
(spaceﬂight met1-7) or eight (all other genotypes and treatments)
plates were used to conduct WGBS and RNASeq analyses, four
biological replicates for each assay.
Experiment Operations for Spaceﬂight
and Ground Controls
The plates comprising the NASA APEX-04-EPEX experiment
was launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10 to the ISS. NASA
astronauts Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough (expedition
49/50) managed the experiment from insertion into the Veggie
growth hardware to harvest (Figures 1A,B). Images and videos
of ISS operations are collected in Supplementary Files 1, 2.
The workﬂow of the orbital operations was recapitulated for
the GCs in the ISSES chamber with a 24 h delay. The delay
enabled a precise ground replication of minor changes in daily ISS
environmental parameters and crew operations scheduling. Crew
operations included the de-stowing of the plates and insertion
into Veggie (Figure 1A), daily high-resolution photography of
representative plates were taken with a hand-held DSLR camera,
and the harvest and ﬁxation of the plates on the ﬁnal day
of growth. Photography and harvests were conducted on the
maintenance work area. All plates were photographed before
harvest, and representatives of each genotype presented in
Figure 1C. The complete set of spaceﬂight and GC photographs
are supplied in the Supplementary File 3. The images were used
to assess the growth morphology and general health of the plants.
Genomic DNA Isolation and
Whole-Genome Bisulﬁte Sequencing
Library Preparation
DNA extraction was done using a modiﬁed phenol/chloroform
protocol (LeFrois et al., 2016) and genome-wide bisulﬁte
sequencing was performed using a similar procedure as that
described by Wang et al. (2013), Zhou et al. (2019). Brieﬂy,
700–1,700 ng of genomic DNA (>5 Kb in length) observed on
the TapeStation Genomic Screen Tape (Agilent) was processed
for sequencing library construction. DNA was transferred into
6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA ﬁber and pre-slit snap
caps (Cat# 520045, Covaris, Inc.) and sheared into an average
fragment size of ∼400 bp using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic
disruptor. Short DNA fragments (<100 bp) were removed using
AMPure magnetic beads (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter) at
a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. 100–250 ng of clean, fragmented
DNA was used for the Illumina sequencing library construction.
Both the NEBNext
R⃝UltraTM II DNA Illumina construction kit
(Cat# E7645S, NEB) and the Illumina-speciﬁc methylated and
dual-index barcoded adaptors (Cat# E7600S NEB) were used
as described in the manufacturer’s guidelines. Illumina libraries
(containing methylated adaptors) were subjected to sodium
bisulﬁte treatment using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct kit
(ZYMO Research, Cat #D5020) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The resulting libraries were enriched by a 13–
15 cycle ampliﬁcation using a uracil-insensitive polymerase
(EpiMark hot start Taq polymerase, NEB, Cat #M0490S). The
ampliﬁed library products were separated on a 2% agarose gel
from which library fragments in the 250–500 bp range were
excised (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Cat# 28704, QIAGEN) and
AMPure puriﬁed (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter). Gel staining
was done with SYBR Safe (Life Technologies) and visualized on
a blue light transilluminator (Life Technologies) to avoid UV
damage to the DNA. The ﬁnal libraries were quantiﬁed by the

qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Cat# KK4824,
Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an ABI7900HT real-time
PCR system (LifeTechnologies). The average library size was
350 bp. Care was taken to generate WGBS libraries that were
approximately the same size as the RNASeq libraries. Sequencing
was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing Core1.

was followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext
Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs,
catalog #E7420) according to the manufacturer’s user guide.
Brieﬂy, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis
Buﬀer via incubation at 94◦C for the desired time. This step
was followed by ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse
transcriptase and Oligo(dT) primers. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was
performed using the second strand master mix provided in the
kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point,
Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library
(uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 10 cycles of ampliﬁcation,
and puriﬁed with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter,
catalog # A63881). 48 barcoded libraries were sized on the
Bioanalyzer and quantiﬁed with the Qubit

Finally, these 48 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar
concentration. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF
ICBR Gene Expression Core2.

Uniquely barcoded libraries were normalized to 2.5 nM
and pooled (equimolarly) for sequencing on the HiSeq3000
Illumina sequencer. Bisulﬁte-converted sequencing libraries were
sequenced together with RNASeq libraries (uniquely barcoded)
to maximize data output. The RNASeq libraries in the pool
served to compensate for the low base diversity of bisulﬁte-
converted genomic libraries. The ﬁnal library was created by

with a mere 1% PhiX spike-in. Library pools were processed
according to the Illumina protocol (HiSeq3000) for clustering
on the cBOT machine. After denaturation, neutralization, and
mixing with the ExAmp reagent, the ﬁnal pool concentration for
clustering was 0.25 nM. Sequencing was done using a 2 × 101
cycles format (paired-end conﬁguration). The 48-sample project
was sequenced on 12 lanes for a robust reads/lane output.
MethylSeq Bioinformatics
The short reads from the uniquely barcoded bisulﬁte-converted
genomic libraries were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36
and quality control on the original and trimmed reads was
performed using FastQC v 0.11.4 and MultiQC v 1.1 (Andrews,
2010; Bolger et al., 2014; Ewels et al., 2016). The bisulﬁte-
converted reads were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using
BSMAP (Xi and Li, 2009). Methylation calling was performed
with CSCALL and the diﬀerential methylation analysis was
performed using the MCOMP program, which is part of the
MOABS package (Abe et al., 1997; Sun et al., 2014). Cytosine
sites with at least a 10x read coverage in at least two out
of the four replicates were included in downstream analyses.
Methylated cytosine sites for which the p-value of the diﬀerence
between test and control methylation rates was below 0.01
were considered diﬀerentially methylated cytosines (DmCs).
In addition, DmCs with a methylation diﬀerence > 0 were
classiﬁed as hypermethylated whereas those < 0 were classiﬁed
as hypomethylated. DmCs were also categorized based on the
characteristics of their genomic locations including the gene body
(from transcriptional start site to transcriptional termination
site), promoter (2 kb upstream of transcriptional start site), and
downstream (2 kb downstream of transcriptional termination
site). Diﬀerentially methylated regions (DMRs) were deﬁned
following the method described in Stroud et al. (2013). Brieﬂy,
DMRs were determined by comparing the average methylation
levels within a 100 bp window between spaceﬂight and GCs,
and those with statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.01) were used in
the analysis. The reads mapped to the chloroplast reference
genome were used to calculate the bisulﬁte conversion eﬃciency
as previously described (Zhou et al., 2019).
RNASeq Bioinformatics
The overall quality of the RNASeq sequence data was ﬁrst
evaluated using FastQC (Andrews, 2010, 2018). Low-quality
bases were trimmed from the reads using Trimmomatic (Bolger
et al., 2014). STAR Aligner was used to map high-quality
paired-end reads to TAIR10 genome (Vandenbrink et al., 2016).
Gene expression values were calculated from these alignments
using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). The expected read counts
and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped
reads (FPKM) were extracted for further analysis. A generalized
linear regression model was built to perform the diﬀerential
gene analysis using edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010). Prior to
the diﬀerential expression analysis, hierarchical clustering and
principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify
potential outliers in the samples. The thresholds for calling
signiﬁcantly DEG were set at, FDR of 0.05, a fold change of
greater than 2, and the average FPKM for at least one replicate
of each comparison group being higher than 0. DEG lists were
analyzed for overlaps using BioVenn (Hulsen et al., 2008).
Processing and Analysis of the RNASeq data was performed at
the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core3.
Functional Categories Enrichment
Arabidopsis thaliana gene IDs from each list of diﬀerentially
methylated, diﬀerentially expressed genes (DmC-DEGs) output
from combined methylomic and transcriptomic data were
submitted to g:Proﬁler using the standard parameters (Raudvere
et al., 2019). Lists of gene ontology (GO) terms enriched
within each group of DmC-DEGs were trimmed using REVIGO
(Supek et al., 2011).
Statistical Analyses
Original Student’s t-tests were done with Bonferroni corrections.
Two-Factor ANOVA analyses with replication were performed to
demonstrate statistical diﬀerences in methylation levels between
genotypes and plant organ samples.
RESULTS
Col-0 and met1-7 Exhibited a Typical
Spaceﬂight Growth Morphology, While
elp2-5 Displayed an Unusual Spaceﬂight
Morphology
The
three
genotypes,
Col-0,
met1-7,
and
elp2-5
each
demonstrated diﬀerent growth habits in response to spaceﬂight.
Figure 1C shows a representative plate of each genotype grown
on the ISS (spaceﬂight, FT) and comparable GC. Photos of all the
harvested plates are presented in Supplementary File 3.
Col-0 and met1-7 exhibited a typical growth morphology of
Arabidopsis grown in Veggie during spaceﬂight (Figure 1A). The
strong directional growth light gradient in Veggie produces a
negative phototropism in roots that results in root growth that
largely mimics terrestrial gravitropism (Zhou et al., 2019; Califar
et al., 2020). For both Col-0 and met1-7 the spaceﬂight (FT)
roots adopt a slightly randomized growth habit compared to
the GCs, yet extend well away from the site of germination and
the stem, and are generally negatively phototropic in response
to the “vertical” orientation of the plates relative to the light
source in the Veggie growth habitat. The Col-0 and met1-7 plants
presented healthy visual phenotypes, where their leaves were fully
expanded and green.
In contrast, elp2-5 plants exhibit spaceﬂight growth patterns
that were distinct from both Col-0 wild-type and met1-7, and
did not appear to be responding to the environmental tropic
cues directing roots away from the lights in Veggie (Figure 1C).
The roots of elp2-5 in spaceﬂight did not exhibit any directional
growth. Instead, all root growth appeared to occur in random
patterns that resulted in most of the root mass staying within 1 cm
of the germinated seed. The spaceﬂight leaves of elp2-5 tended to

be darker, with more of the plants exhibiting reddish coloration
typical of anthocyanin production. Several of the elp2-5 leaves on
each of the spaceﬂight plates were chlorotic.
In spite of any morphological diﬀerences among the
genotypes, all produced the same biomass in spaceﬂight as on
the ground. No statistically supported diﬀerences were observed
between ﬂight and GCs in either roots or shoots, for all three
genotypes (Supplementary Figure 1).
Spaceﬂight Increased Genome-Wide
DNA Methylation Levels in met1-7 and
elp2-5 but Not in the Wild-Type Col-0
Plants
In the GC plant leaves, the methylation level of met1-7 was
statistically lower than that of Col-0 and elp2-5 plants in all
three methylation contexts. Col-0 and elp2-5 and plants showed
similar genome-wide methylation levels (Figures 2A,B). In the
GC plant roots, the methylation level of met1-7 was statistically
lower than that of Col-0 and elp2-5 plants in the CG and CHG
contexts. In the CHH context, there were no statistical diﬀerences
in methylation among genotypes.
In spaceﬂight plants, the methylation levels varied greatly
in each genotype, methylation context and tissue type. The
ﬂight elp2-5 plants showed a higher methylation level compared
to Col-0 in all methylation contexts in both leaves and roots
(Figures 2C,D). The ﬂight met1-7 methylation levels were lower
than Col-0 in the CG context in both leaves and roots. However,
met1-7 showed higher methylation levels than Col-0 in the
CHG and CHH contexts in ﬂight leaves while showing similar
methylation levels in roots (Figures 2C,D).
In Col-0 the average genome-wide methylation levels within
each context were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between ﬂight
and GC plants, for either leaves or roots (Figures 2E,F).
However, met1-7 and elp2-5 both showed signiﬁcant increases in
methylation levels in spaceﬂight compared to GCs (Figures 2G–
J). The elp2-5 mutants showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
average genome-wide methylation levels between spaceﬂight and
GCs in each organ and all methylation contexts (Figures 2G,H).
The met1-7 mutants shared similar trends as the elp2-5 mutants
in their leaves, however, signiﬁcant diﬀerences between FT and
GC were only seen in the CG context of root tissues (Figures 2I,J
and Supplementary File 4) includes a detailed breakdown of the
distribution of methylation levels, divided into bins ranging from
0 to 100% methylation.
Spaceﬂight Changes in DNA Methylation
Levels Were Associated With
Protein-Coding Gene Regions
Changes in DNA methylation induced by spaceﬂight associated
with protein-coding and ﬂanking genic regions [2 kb upstream
from the transcription start site (TSS), gene body (gold bar), and
2 kb downstream from transcription termination site] are shown
in Figure 3. Pairwise comparison between each methylation
mutant and the wild type control are depicted using plot lines
color-coded to indicate the environmental conditions [ﬂight, (F)
and ground (G)], the genotype [Col-0 (C), elp2-5 (E), and met1-7
(M)] and the tissue type [leaves (L) and roots (R)], as indicated
in the upper right legend of each comparison plot. Thus, the
pink line in Figure 3A, FCL, reﬂects the percentage of average
methylation for ﬂight, Col-0 leaves across a 4 kb protein-coding
region of the genome.
The elp2-5 and met1-7 lines diﬀered in their methylation levels
across genic regions compared to Col-0. In leaves, Col-0 and elp2-
5 showed similar CG, CHG, and CHH methylation levels across
genic regions associated with protein-coding for both spaceﬂight
and GC environments, as seen by the almost overlapping traces
in Figure 3A. However, Col-0 and met1-7 leaves demonstrated
notable diﬀerences in the CG methylation context. The met1-
7 mutants had lower average CG methylation levels compared
to Col-0 across all genic regions, with a pronounced diﬀerence
within the gene body region (gold bar in graph). In spaceﬂight,
met1-7 leaves have a higher methylation level across all genic
regions when compared to the GCs (Figure 3B).
The elp2-5 roots showed higher spaceﬂight-associated CG,
CHG, and CHH methylation levels across all genic regions
compared to Col-0 (Figure 3C), but there were diﬀerences among
the contexts with respect to the methylation levels for the other
genotypes. In the CG methylation context, the GC Col-0 roots,
GC elp2-5 roots, and ﬂight Col-0 roots all had similar methylation
levels, whereas ﬂight elp2-5 roots showed increased methylation.
In the CHG and CHH context, ﬂight Col-0 roots had a slightly
lower average methylation level across all genic regions when
compared to GCs.
The met1-7 roots demonstrated noticeable diﬀerences in the
CG methylation context, with the most pronounced diﬀerence
within the gene body region (Figure 3D). Flight Col-0 roots
had a lower CG methylation level across the gene body regions
when compared to the GCs. The ﬂight met1-7 roots had a higher
CG methylation level across ﬂanking upstream and downstream
genic regions compared to their GCs. In the CHG methylation
contexts, there were no obvious diﬀerences between Col-0 and
met1-7 genotypes in either ﬂight or GCs. In the CHH context,
ﬂight Col-0 roots, GC met1-7 roots, and ﬂight met1-7 roots had
similar methylation levels, levels that were slightly lower than GC
Col-0 roots (Figure 3D).
Spaceﬂight Altered the Distribution and
Direction of DmCs in elp2-5 and met1-7
Leaves and Roots
The distribution of cytosines diﬀerentially methylated by
spaceﬂight within each methylation context in both leaves
and roots was assessed for each mutant relative to the wild-
type genotype. DmCs were identiﬁed as those cytosines with
a diﬀerential methylation that was statistically signiﬁcant to
p < 0.01 in each comparison and context (Figure 4). The
percentage of DmCs was also mapped to diﬀerent genomic
regions for each methylation context. The percentage maps of
Upstream (2 kb upstream of the TSS), UTRs, Exons, Introns,
Downstream (2 kb downstream of the polyadenylation site),
transposable element, Intergenic, and Pseudogenes are shown for
each genotype in the ﬂight vs ground comparisons of leaves and
roots (Supplementary Figure 3).

of DmCs in the CHG context in the elp2-5 plants changed very
little among organs and environments (15–18%). Most of the
elp2-5 DmCs were hypermethylated (Figures 4A,B). In the met1-

In leaves, this decrease in the percentage of CG DmCs in FT

The distribution of gene-related DmCs in response to
spaceﬂight was genotype- and organ-speciﬁc (Figure 5). In
Col-0 leaves, DmCs were primarily hypomethylated. In the
upstream and downstream ﬂanking regions, the CHH context
predominated, but within the gene body the CHH and CG
contexts were about equally represented, and CGH methylation
the least represented (Figure 5A). In contrast, in both elp2-5
and met1-7 leaves the DmCs were primarily hypermethylated
(Figures 5B,C). In elp2-5 leaves methylation in the CHH context
predominated in loci within all genic regions (Figure 5B). In

met1-7 leaves the CG and CHH contexts were about equally
represented in all genic regions (Figure 5C). In Col-0 roots,
DmCs were again primarily hypomethylated, but unlike in
leaves, the CHH context predominated within all genic regions
(Figure 5D). As with leaves, the DmCs in both elp2-5 and met1-
7 roots were predominantly hypermethylated (Figures 5E,F). In
elp2-5 roots, methylation of DmCs in the CHH context again
predominated in loci within all genic regions, and loci with
CG and CHG methylation were about equally distributed in
each genic region (Figure 5E). In met1-7 roots, DmCs with
methylation in the CHH contexts were slightly more abundant
across all genic regions, but methylation in all contexts was higher
in the downstream genic region (Figure 5F).
Each genotype displayed distinct, organ-speciﬁc distributions
of DMRs between spaceﬂight and the GCs (Figure 6). DMRs
were determined by comparing the average methylation levels
within 100 bp windows between FT and GC, and regions with
a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p < 0.01) were used in the
analysis. In the Col-0 spaceﬂight response, 659 DMRs were
detected in leaves, and 765 DMRs in roots. In both Col-0
tissues, an average of 51% of the DMRs were found within the
CHH context, whereas the other half of the DMR were evenly
distributed between the CHG and CG contexts at 24.5% each.
In elp2-5, there were 717 DMRs in leaves and 2,974 DMRs in
roots (Figure 6A). In both elp2-5 tissues, an average of 63% of
the DMRs were found in the CHH context, which was 12% more
than Col-0. DMRs in the CHG context were distributed similarly
to that of Col-0 at an average of 25%, however, DMRs in the
CG context were at an average of 12.5% which was about half
that of Col-0. In met1-7, there were 6,114 DMRs in leaves and
3,745 DMRs in roots. The majority of the DMRs in both tissues
were in the CG context at an average of 83%. DMRs in the CHG
context in both tissues were at an average of 8.5% whereas DMRs
in the CHH context averaged 12% in the leaves and 5% in the
roots (Figure 6A).
The spaceﬂight-associated DMRs in Col-0 were distributed
between hypo and hypermethylation, while hypomethylated
DMRs predominated in the mutants. In Col-0 leaves, 39% of the
DMRs were hypomethylated and 61% hypermethylated, whereas
in Col-0 roots, 67% of the DMRs were hypomethylated and 33%
were hypermethylated. However, in both elp2-5 and met1-7 leaves
and roots, DMRs were predominantly hypermethylated ranging
from 97 to 99% (Figure 6B). Gene-related DMRs (Figure 6C)
reﬂected organ-speciﬁc responses to spaceﬂight in all genotypes,
but the largest diﬀerence in the number of DMR loci between
leaves and roots was in elp2-5. In Col-0 leaves and roots, the
number of DMRs in all genic regions and context was less
than 400, with the highest number of DMRs found within the
CHH context. In gene-related DMRs in Col-0 leaves hypo-
and hypermethylation were fairly evenly distributed across all
contexts, whereas in Col-0 roots, gene-related DMRs were mostly
hypomethylated (70%). In Col-0 leaves and roots, gene-related
DMRs were most abundant in the gene body region. In contrast
to wild-type Col-0, the total gene-related DMRs in elp2-5 were
substantially higher in the roots compared to the leaves. In elp2-
5 roots, DMRs were primarily in the CHH context and were
predominantly hypermethylated in all genic regions. The highest
number of DMRs in the elp2-5 roots were within the gene body
region. In met1-7, DMRs were found at a higher number in the
leaves compared to the roots. DMRs in both leaves and roots were
predominantly hypermethylated and were distributed primarily
in the CG context. In met1-7 leaves, the highest number of DMRs
were located upstream of the TSS (Figure 6C).
Spaceﬂight Affected More Genes in the
Roots of elp2-5, and More Genes in the
Leaves of met1-7
Spaceﬂight associated diﬀerential gene expression was genotype-
and organ-speciﬁc; in elp2-5 more genes were aﬀected in roots,
while in met1-7 more genes were aﬀected in leaves (Figure 7).
Transcripts showing at least a twofold change (−1 ≤log2 FC ≥1)
with an FDR value of < 0.05 were identiﬁed as DEGs. PCAs of
each type of tissue were performed individually, as leaves and
roots have widely diﬀerent patterns of gene expression (Paul
et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2019). The PCA plots of leaves and
roots showed diﬀerent grouping of elp2-5 samples along with
the components compared to Col-0 and met1-7 (Supplementary
File 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). In the comparison of
spaceﬂight to ground leaves, Col-0 had a total of 207 (123 up-
regulated and 84 down-regulated) DEGs, elp2-5 had 36 (26 up-
regulated and 10 down-regulated) DEGs, and met1-7 had 226
(160 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated) DEGs (Figure 7A). In
roots, a total of 147 (28 up-regulated and 119 down-regulated),
120 (50 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated), and 47 (39 up-
regulated and 8 down-regulated) DEGs were found in Col-
0, elp2-5, and met1-7, respectively (Figure 7B). Only a few
DEGs overlapped between the genotypes in both leaf and root
tissues (Figures 7C,D). In leaves, the majority of DEGs were
unique to Col-0 and met1-7, whereas, in roots, the majority
of DEGs were unique to Col-0 and elp2-5 (Figures 7C,D).
The patterns of DEGs in all three genotypes were distinctly
organ-speciﬁc, and of the 436 DEGs in leaves and 288 in
roots, only 35 DEGs were common to both sets (Figure 7E).
Although there were overall fewer root-speciﬁc DEGs, a greater
proportion of the root DEGs were also diﬀerentially methylated
in response to spaceﬂight compared to the DEGs of leaves.
In roots, 82% of the DEGs also exhibited DmCs, whereas in
leaves, 31% of the DEGs also mapped to DmCs (Figure 7F and
Supplementary File 5).
The composition of DmC-DEGs in elp2-5 compared to Col-
0 was distinctive in each environmental and organ comparison
(Figure 8). In leaves, elp2-5 vs Col-0 on the ground had
a total of 2,119 DEGs (1,322 up-regulated and 797 down-
regulated) whereas in spaceﬂight there were a total of 2,149
DEGs (1,448 up-regulated and 701 down-regulated; Figure 8A).
Of these, 996 DEGs were also diﬀerentially methylated in
the GCs, and a total of 1,188 DmC-DEGs were observed
in spaceﬂight (Figure 8B). A total of 497 DmCs-DEGs were
shared between both environmental conditions. In roots, the
pairwise comparison of elp2-5 and Col-0 revealed a total of
1,667 (725 up-regulated and 942 down-regulated) DEGs on the
ground and 1,626 (724 up-regulated and 902 down-regulated)
DEGs in spaceﬂight (Figure 8C). Of these, 1,222 DEGs on

Processes shared as enriched between leaf and root DmC-DEGs

of 840 (355 up-regulated and 485 down-regulated) DEGs in GC,
whereas in FT 637 (375 up-regulated and 262 down-regulated)
DEGs were observed (Figure 9A). DmC-DEGs in the met1-7 to
Col-0 leaves comparison revealed 527 diﬀerentially methylated
and expressed transcripts on the ground and 408 in ﬂight, of
which 261 were unique to GC, 142 unique to FT, and 266 were
shared among both conditions (Figure 9B). In the roots, the
pairwise comparison of met1-7 and Col-0 in the GC revealed a
total of 779 (343 up-regulated and 436 down-regulated) DEGs
and a total of 593 (369 up-regulated and 224 down-regulated)
DEGs in spaceﬂight (Figure 9C). DmC-DEGs in the met1-7 to
Col-0 roots comparison revealed a total of 648 DmC-DEGs in GC
roots and 430 DmC-DEGs in FT roots, of which 313 were shared
in both conditions (Figure 9D).
Gene ontology analysis of DmC-DEGs between met1-
7
and the wild-type line yielded few term enrichments
(Figure 8E). Biological process enrichments associated with
hypoxic responses and biosynthesis of anthocyanin-containing
compounds were present in GC root DmC-DEGs. Molecular
functions of ADP binding, sesquiterpene compound synthase
activities, and cell wall constituents, and nutrient reservoir
activity were enriched in leaf GC DmC-DEGs, leaf FT DmC-
DEGs, and root GC DmC-DEGs, respectively.
Alignments of DmC-DEGs in each methylation context in
the various genic regions were generated for each genotype and
depicted as heatmaps (Figure 10). In leaves, a total of 59 DmC-
DEGs were observed in wild-type Col-0, while in elp2-5 and met1-
7, there were 11 and 72 DmC-DEGs, respectively. Correlations
between diﬀerential expression and DNA methylation were used
to organize the heatmap. The top bracketed sections of the
heatmaps show negative correlations where up-regulated genes
aligned with hypomethylated DmCs and down-regulated genes
aligned with hypermethylated DmCs are grouped. The following
bracketed section shows positive correlations where the converse
relationship between DEGs and DmCs was highlighted. The
unbracketed section at the bottom of the heatmap shows genes
that have no distinguishable correlations between DEGs and
DmCs. In Col-0 leaves, 41% (24 out of 59) of genes had a negative
correlation and 49% (29 out of 59) had a positive correlation.
In elp2-5 leaves, negative and positive correlation were evenly
distributed at 45% (5 out of 11), whereas in met1-7 leaves, 26% (19
out of 72) of genes showed a negative correlation and 60% (43 out
of 72) had a positive correlation. In roots, there were a total of 114
DmC-DEGs in Col-0, 101 DmC-DEGs in elp2-5, and 28 DmC-
DEGs in met1-7 (Figure 11). 16% (19 out of 114) of the wild-type
Col-0 root DmC-DEGs had a negative correlation between gene
expression and methylation levels, whereas 66% (75 out of 114)
were positively correlated. In elp2-5 roots, 54% (55 out of 101)
of genes showed a negative correlation, and 42% (42 out of 101)
showed a positive correlation. In met1-7 roots, 36% (10 out of 28)
of genes showed a negative correlation, and 50% (14 out of 28)
showed a positive correlation.
Gene ontology analysis of the lists of DmC-DEGs from the FT
vs GC contrasts revealed that the elp2-5 and met1-7 lines lacked
enrichment of diﬀerential expression in traditional spaceﬂight
acclimation processes (Figure 12). In Col-0 leaves, DmC-DEGs
were enriched in localization to glyoxosomes (Figure 12A). The
DmC-DEGs observed in the spaceﬂight response of met1-7 leaves
were in pathways associated with the metabolism of pigments
containing anthocyanins. The enrichments among the Col-0 root
FT vs GC DmC-DEGs were primarily associated with defense
pathways and responses to hypoxia, as well as the cell wall
and membrane nanodomains (Figure 12B and Supplementary
Table 1). Col-0 and elp2-5 roots showed enrichments of
molecular function GO terms, involving FAD and manganese
ion binding, and carbonate dehydratase activity, respectively.
A secondary analysis using all FT vs GC DEGs showed that
the analysis of only DmC-DEGs recapitulated the majority of
the terms associated with the overall transcriptomic response
to spaceﬂight (data not shown). The GO-associated processes,
localizations, and functions represented by these terms are gained
or lost from the methylation-sensitive aspect of the spaceﬂight
response dependent on the functionality of ELP2 and MET1.
DISCUSSION
DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating stress
responses and physiological adaptation in plants (Boyko and
Kovalchuk, 2010; Dowen et al., 2012; Zhang, 2012; Wang
et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013; Garg et al., 2015; Tameshige
et al., 2015; Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2019).
Physiological adaptation to spaceﬂight engages gene expression
changes that at least mimic several terrestrial stress responses
(Hoson et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2008; Salmi and Roux,
2008; Blancaﬂor, 2013; Correll et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013;
Zupanska et al., 2013; Ferl et al., 2014; Inglis et al., 2014;
Nakashima et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014; Kwon et al.,
2015; Schüler et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Barker et al.,
2017; Choi et al., 2019; Kruse et al., 2020; Supplementary
Table 2). In addition, the ﬁrst whole-genome survey of
DNA methylation in wild-type WS Arabidopsis plants grown
entirely in the spaceﬂight environment showed correlated
changes in DNA methylation accompanying regulation of DEGs
in spaceﬂight, especially in stress response genes such as
those associated with defense responses and ROS signaling
(Zhou et al., 2019). However, such correlations do not
establish a functional connection between DNA methylation
and physiological adaptation to the spaceﬂight environment.
Therefore, two methylation mutant lines, each deﬁcient in
separate and distinct functions that aﬀect methylation, were
grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceﬂight compared
to that of wild type. The assays for response to spaceﬂight were
overall growth and morphology, gene expression proﬁles, and
DNA methylation proﬁles.
The elp2-5 plants failed to grow normally in spaceﬂight
(Figure 1A). Previous experiments have shown that in the
microgravity of spaceﬂight, plant root growth is altered compared
to growth on the ground, yet when presented with directional
light, roots generally grow away from the light source and
establish a near normal growth pattern, and present a generally
healthy-looking morphology (Paul et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2019).
However, the roots of the elp2-5 plants in spaceﬂight did not

set up this typical spaceﬂight directionality, as the roots did
not navigate away from the germinated seed. The total biomass
of the elp2-5 plants on orbit was similar to that of the GCs
(Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, all of the biomass of the elp2-
5 spaceﬂight plants was concentrated into the area very near
the seed, which may accelerate the depletion of nutrients in the
immediate vicinity of germination. Nutrient depletion stress is
also apparent in the elp2-5 spaceﬂight transcriptome. The leaves
of the spaceﬂight elp2-5 plants appeared to be less expanded,
more chlorotic and displayed more reddish pigmentation than
the leaves of the GCs (Figure 1C). The elp2-5 mutants generally
exhibit over-accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, which can
be further exacerbated by stress (Zhou et al., 2009). This
distinct, spaceﬂight-dependent, morphology for elp2-5 plants
suggests that elp2-5 plants are physiologically maladapted to
spaceﬂight. While it has been established that ELP2 has a role
in root development (e.g., Jia et al., 2015) the spaceﬂight data
suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in gravity perception

and root navigation. In terrestrial environments, where gravity
can impart a tropic force, plants lacking ELP2 have shorter
roots but grow reasonably well (Jia et al., 2015). However,
in the absence of gravity, elp2-5 mutant roots appear to lose
the ability to navigate eﬀectively away from the site of the
germinating seed.

The q-value cutoff was set at 0.05. Higher values in the scaling indicate higher signiﬁcance of the enrichment.
The met1-7 plants appeared better able to cope with the
absence of gravity than elp2-5 plants, as their spaceﬂight
root growth patterns were similar to Col-0, with no obvious
deleterious morphologies seen on orbit (Figure 1C). The met1-
7 plants produced as much biomass on orbit as in the GCs
(Supplementary Figure 1) and established a root growth pattern
that was visually typical of spaceﬂight growth (Paul et al.,
2012; Zhou et al., 2019) and similar to the appearance of Col-
0 (Figure 1C).
The diﬀerential spaceﬂight morphologies of elp2-5 and met1-7
suggest that the DNA methylation events conditioned by MET1
and ELP2 diﬀerentially aﬀect spaceﬂight physiological adaptation
and success. Since MET1 and ELP2 represent two diﬀerent
mechanisms that aﬀect methylation, these results suggest that
spaceﬂight might aﬀect the methylation of speciﬁc genes more
than the genome-wide status of methylation.
The degree of genome-wide methylation was not statistically
diﬀerent between spaceﬂight and GCs for Col-0, but both elp2-5
and met1-7 were generally hypermethylated compared to the GCs
(Figure 2 and Supplementary File 1). This result reinforces the
conclusion that changes in overall average genome methylation
is not a hallmark of spaceﬂight adaptation in wild-type plants,
as this result was also seen in the spaceﬂight methylome of
Arabidopsis cultivar WS (Zhou et al., 2019). However, the
hypermethylation of the mutant genomes suggested that the
respective contributions of MET1 and ELP2 are important to
maintaining an appropriate degree of genome-wide methylation
in the physiological adaptation to spaceﬂight. The degree of
DNA methylation within each context in elp2-5 was signiﬁcantly
increased in response to spaceﬂight in both leaves and roots
(Figures 2G,H) compared to the degree of methylation of these
mutants with respect to wild type in the GCs. However, there
was a distinction between the two mutant lines in the degree
and context of methylation in the respective root genomes. The
spaceﬂight elp2-5 root genome was signiﬁcantly hypermethylated
in all contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH) compared to the GCs,
whereas only CG methylation was elevated in the spaceﬂight
met1-7 genome (Figures 2D,H,J). Although the contribution
of CHG and CHH methylation in Arabidopsis is generally
small (about 14%; Niederhuth et al., 2016) it is possible that
while genome-wide changes in CG methylation does not impact
spaceﬂight root growth morphology, changes in the CHG and
CHH context may contribute to the spaceﬂight phenotype of
elp2-5 plants.

coding regions showed organ-speciﬁcity among all genotypes.
Methylation in the protein coding regions is relevant to
gene expression proﬁles, which are also highly organ speciﬁc.
Spaceﬂight induced more CG methylation across all protein-
coding regions (upstream, gene body, and downstream) in met1-
7 leaves and only increased methylation in the upstream and
downstream regions in roots (Figure 3). Conversely, elp2-5
methylation was increased across all protein-coding regions and
methylation contexts only in the roots in response to spaceﬂight
(Figure 3). The substantial increase in CHH methylation in elp2-
5 roots (Figures 4A,B) suggests that ELP2 plays a dominant role

Paul et al.
Epigenomic Regulators Condition Spaceﬂight Response
in governing the spaceﬂight-associated methylation changes in
the roots, speciﬁcally in the CHH context. This correlates with
the root growth morphology exhibited by elp2-5.
Col-0, met1-7, and elp2-5 are each diﬀerent in their spaceﬂight
gene expression and DNA methylation proﬁles. The proﬁles of
diﬀerentially expressed and diﬀerentially methylated genes in
both elp2-5 and met1-7 were unique compared to wild-type Col-
0 (Figures 10, 11 and Supplementary Figure 2). The loss of
MET1 and ELP2 each had a substantial inﬂuence on the proﬁles
of DEGs and diﬀerentially methylated genes in response to the
spaceﬂight environment. The types and functions of the genes
that are diﬀerentially expressed in the elp2-5 spaceﬂight plants
indicate that the spaceﬂight plants are under considerable stress
compared to GCs. Almost a third of the genes uniquely induced
in the spaceﬂight elp2-5 leaves are associated with nutrient stress,
and most of the rest are genes associated with heat stress, ROS
and pathogen responses. These gene classes were also noticeably
represented among the elp2-5 spaceﬂight root DEGs. These
gene expression patterns describe a highly stressed response
reﬂecting the compact growth morphology of the spaceﬂight
elp2-5 plants. The types and functions of the genes that are
diﬀerentially expressed in the met1-7 spaceﬂight plants suggest
that met1-7 plants were better adjusted to spaceﬂight than the
elp2-5 plants. As with the elp2-5 plants, the met1-7 plants present
a number of stress-associated DEGs. However, in contrast to
the types of genes expressed by spaceﬂight elp2-5 plants, the
DEGs in spaceﬂight met1-7 plants predominantly functioned in
signal transduction, as membrane transporters or transcriptional
activators (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary File 6).
While organ-speciﬁc diﬀerences in the gene expression
patterns of various Arabidopsis tissue types (leaves, hypocotyls,
roots, and root tips) have been previously reported in spaceﬂight
transcriptomes (Paul et al., 2013, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019), the
met1-7 and elp2-5 plant lines each demonstrated a diﬀerent
pattern of organ-speciﬁc expression and methylation. A large
proportion of the diﬀerentially methylated and expressed genes
in leaves were observed in Col-0 (59 out of 207) and met1-7 (72
out of 226), whereas in roots a large proportion of diﬀerentially
methylated and expressed genes were found in Col-0 (114 out
of 147) and elp2-5 (101 out of 120). Only 8% of the leaf DEGs
and 12% of the root DEGs overlap between the genotypes,
suggesting that unique organ-speciﬁc mechanisms were engaged
for spaceﬂight adaptation, with MET1 playing a more important
role in leaves and ELP2 having the more important role in roots,
in the physiological adaptation to spaceﬂight.
The relationships between DNA methylation and gene
expression in spaceﬂight were complex and diﬀered between
leaves and roots. In wild-type Col-0 leaves, the hypomethylated
DmCs and hypermethylated DmCs were evenly distributed
across all contexts and all genic regions (Figure 5A). The
association of changes in methylation with gene expression
showed an even proportion of positive and negative correlation.
In met1-7 leaves, DmCs were predominantly hypermethylated
in the CG and CHH contexts of downstream regions, and a
larger proportion of positive correlations were observed among
DmC-DEGs (Figure 10). In elp2-5 roots, DmCs were primarily
hypermethylated in the CHH context across all genic regions, yet
a larger proportion of DmC-DEGs showed a negative correlation
(Figure 11). These observations are in contrast with other studies
that report a strong negative correlation between promoter
CG methylation and gene expression levels (Finnegan et al.,
1996; Garg et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2015). Further investigations
may clarify the relationship between leaf spaceﬂight transcript
abundance and methylation in diﬀerent contexts and genic
regions. However, 80% of DEGs (across all genotypes) were also
diﬀerentially methylated in roots. In leaves, that average was only
30% (Figure 7F). These data suggest that DNA methylation plays
a signiﬁcantly larger role in regulating the genes associated with
the spaceﬂight response in roots than in leaves.
The genes diﬀerentially regulated by elp2-5 and met1-7 in
spaceﬂight were from distinctly diﬀerent metabolic processes
than those regulated in Col-0 in response to spaceﬂight.
Functional analyses of DmC-DEGs showed sharp contrasts
among elp2-5 and met1-7 with the Col-0 wild-type. The mutant
elp2-5 line showed diﬀerential methylation and expression
of gene classes traditionally associated with the spaceﬂight
response and other abiotic stresses, such as metabolic processes
and defense, hormone, and hypoxic responses across tissue
types (Figure 8E; Cramer et al., 2011). The mutant met1-
7 line, conversely, demonstrated relatively few GO term
enrichments, indicating that DmC-DEGs tended to result from
largely untargeted changes in methylation (Figure 9E). ELP2
regulates root growth and development, and elp2 loss of
function mutants display shorter roots, and this phenotype
may be linked to the root-speciﬁc involvement of DmC-
DEGs associated with ion homeostasis, transport processes, and
extracellular localization observed in this study (Figures 1C,
8E; Jia et al., 2015). The spaceﬂight-associated processes
that are diﬀerentially represented in elp2-5 are also among
the primary classes enriched in DmC-DEGs involved in the
spaceﬂight acclimation of Col-0 (Figures 8E, 12). These data
suggest that the spaceﬂight response works more directly
through DNA methylation mechanisms and other mechanisms
regulated by ELP2 than through the maintenance mechanisms
represented by MET1.
DNA methylation proﬁles within a genome are dynamic
and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development,
and stress responses (reviewed in: Bartels et al., 2018). The
response to spaceﬂight includes diﬀerential DNA methylation
in a manner that is similar to known terrestrial stress
responses, particularly those associated with pathogen attack
or harsh environments. Supplementary Table 2 provides a
comparison of these spaceﬂight-associated DmC-DEGs with
those from several terrestrial studies of environmental stress
responses (Yong-Villalobos et al., 2016; Hewezi et al., 2017,
2018;
Stassen
et
al.,
2018;
Korotko
et
al.,
2021).
This
correlation strongly suggests that the spaceﬂight response,
though novel, utilizes a range of mechanistic approaches that
are typically employed during terrestrial environmental stress.
While direct methylation mechanisms represented by MET1
certainly aﬀect the spaceﬂight response in terms of gene
expression proﬁles, the indirect DNA demethylation/methylation
mechanisms associated with ELP2 have a more profound role
than MET1 in the spaceﬂight response.

CONCLUSION
Genetic factors that inﬂuence genome DNA methylation directly
impact physiological adaptation to spaceﬂight, aﬀecting overall
growth in space as well as the speciﬁcs of the spaceﬂight gene
response proﬁle. Genome methylation is therefore important for
spaceﬂight responses in much the same way as it is important
for adaptation to terrestrial stresses. In particular, processes
regulated by ELP2 appear critical for proper root directional
development in spaceﬂight. The remodeling of the Arabidopsis
methylome in spaceﬂight, together with the negative outcomes
of interfering with DNA methylation, suggests that epigenetic
marking is a fundamental part of environmental responses, even
during novel environmental stresses outside of the evolutionary
history of plants.
