Spaceﬂight and terrestrial spaceﬂight analogs can alter immune phenotypes. Macrophages are important immune cells that bridge
the innate and adaptive immune systems and participate in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. Furthermore,
macrophages are critically involved in initiating immunity, defending against injury and infection, and are also involved in immune
resolution and wound healing. Heterogeneous populations of macrophage-type cells reside in many tissues and cause a variety of
tissue-speciﬁc effects through direct or indirect interactions with other physiological systems, including the nervous and endocrine
systems. It is vital to understand how macrophages respond to the unique environment of space to safeguard crew members with
appropriate countermeasures for future missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. This review highlights current literature on
macrophage responses to spaceﬂight and spaceﬂight analogs.

INTRODUCTION
Space exploration and habitation will expose crew members to
unique risk factors, including cosmic radiation, altered gravity forces,
social isolation, and enclosed/hostile environments. In addition, these
stressors will be experienced at a substantial distance from Earth,
where emergency medical intervention will be limited. Multiple
studies on crew health and model organisms have determined
spaceﬂight-associated risks can impact nervous, musculoskeletal, and
cardiovascular systems (reviewed in1). Tissue-resident macrophages,
circulating blood monocytes, and lymphatic system responses to
spaceﬂight-associated risk factors can inﬂuence physiological out-
comes in biological systems. Studies performed on space exploration
vehicles and on the International Space Station (ISS) have yielded
varied ﬁndings on immunological patterns, which may be in part due
to limitations to onboard sampling and experimental procedures. In
general, crew members who have ﬂown in space display altered
leukocyte counts and function, as well as chronic low-grade
inﬂammation2–9. Chronic inﬂammation experienced in-ﬂight may
be in response to oxidative damage10 (reviewed in11), which may
also contribute to accelerated aging described post-ﬂight12,13.
However, due
the dynamic
nature of
the immune
system,
contributions of circadian cycling, epigenetics, and differential
response kinetics are only now beginning to be evaluated. Thus,
understanding the impact of spaceﬂight-associated risks on macro-
phage phenotypes and functions is paramount for astronaut health
monitoring and mitigation programs.
Macrophages are key elements of the innate immune response
and play an important role in antigen removal via phagocytosis.
They also direct the adaptive immune response through antigen
presentation and lymphocyte immunological synapse formation.
In addition, many non-genetic, multisystem terrestrial diseases are
caused by aberrant inﬂammation, which is in part regulated by
macrophages (reviewed in14,15).
There is a signiﬁcant knowledge gap in the characterization of
macrophage heterogeneity involved in spaceﬂight-associated
dysfunctions, in addition to identifying homeostatic resolution
processes. Consequently, teasing apart cell type-speciﬁc responses
may help characterize distinct immunological processes observed
in the spaceﬂight environment.
MACROPHAGE IMMUNOBIOLOGY IN SPACEFLIGHT
Immune cell phenotypes and functions are altered in spaceﬂight,
with known consequences for monocytes and macrophages
(Table 1). For instance, elevated monocyte counts were described
in crew at 1-day post-ﬂight (>142-day mission)8. In line with this,
ISS crew monocyte counts are not signiﬁcantly altered at early-
(14-days), mid- (2–4-months) and late-(6-months) timepoints in-
ﬂight, however, are slightly increased immediately upon return to
1 g and at 30-days post-ﬂight7. Collectively, these ﬁndings indicate
elevated monocyte counts during post-ﬂight may be a factor of
immune resolution and recovery. In rodents, on the other hand,
absolute
monocyte
counts
isolated
from
splenocytes
were
reduced immediately post-ﬂight16. Similarly, other studies in rats
report reduced post-ﬂight monocyte counts upon return from a
14-day mission17.

Immune discrepancies between rodent and human mammalian
systems are not entirely uncommon and may be due to multiple
variables, including the strain of experimental mouse, multi-
physiological system inﬂuence, age, sex, duration of spaceﬂight
exposure, environmental microbial inﬂuence, methods or markers of
analysis, and/or landing experiences. Moreover, rodent quadrupedal
models do not recapitulate the bipedal human with an upright,
stacked vertebrae spinal column. Therefore, simulated gravity models
impact rodents and humans differently (reviewed in18), and may
have important implications for monocyte (and other immune cell)
functions. The majority of simulated microgravity studies in rodents
utilize the hindlimb unloading (HU) model, which lifts rodent
hindquarters to cause a cephalad ﬂuid shift similar to what humans
experience in spaceﬂight (reviewed in19). Immunological conse-
quences observed following HU and spaceﬂight are somewhat
similar, such as thymus involution and induced cytokine-type
phenotypes (reviewed in20). Additionally, leukocyte differentials are
also generally similar between HU rodent models and humans post-
ﬂight, including elevated production of inﬂammatory mediators
(reviewed in21). However, careful consideration of spaceﬂight analog
details and a thorough elucidation of all descriptive metadata from
spaceﬂight missions are important for immunological interpretation.
In-ﬂight changes of known macrophage lineage mediators have
also been reported in crew members. For example, IL12-p406,
CXCL-8/IL8, and CXCL-55 cytokines are elevated throughout
multiple timepoints, indicating the potential for some degree of
macrophage activation under microgravity conditions. In addition,
multipaneled measurements of mediators indirectly involved in
macrophage activation are elevated in-ﬂight, including IL-1α, IL-
1β, and IL-1RA3, and TNF-α, IL-17F, and IL-62. In line with this, the
production of immune mediators CCL-2, IL-10, CRP, IL-6, and IL-
1RA are substantially elevated immediately at landing (340-day
mission) in the NASA Twins study (n = 1) that were quickly
reversed in post-ﬂight recovery22. Induction of TNF-α and IL-1β
were also described following in-ﬂight stimulation of the murine
bone marrow-derived cell line, B6MP102 cells, with lipopolysac-
charide (LPS, 12- and 24-hours) on-board STS-37 (6-day mission
duration)23.
In
addition,
although
macrophage
polarization
proﬁles are beginning to be identiﬁed in simulated microgravity
models and spaceﬂight24,25 (reviewed in26,27), more studies on
these unique phenotypes may better assist with unraveling
functional consequences of macrophage alterations in spaceﬂight
(Fig. 1). Recently, Lv et al. discussed a negative role for
microgravity on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) differentia-
tion and polarization processes, including non-polarized (M0), pro-
inﬂammatory (M1), and anti-inﬂammatory (M2) subtypes. Under
microgravity and simulated microgravity conditions, differentia-
tion of HPC into macrophages and the polarization of macro-
phages into M1 or M2 types were mutually impaired24,25
(reviewed in26,27). Thus, spaceﬂight risk factors may inﬂuence
macrophage differentiation/polarization processes in ﬂight.
In a post-ﬂight study, human monocytes displayed reduced
phagocytic activity immediately following short- (8–10 days) and
long- (125–195 days) duration spaceﬂight missions28. Another study
found that monocyte phagocytic function was depressed immedi-
ately upon return to Earth (within 3 h) and at day 3 post-ﬂight29.
Murine splenocyte phagocytosis was also impaired immediately
post-ﬂight (within 5 h) after a 13-day spaceﬂight mission16. The
inability to remove cellular debris, apoptotic cells, or pathogens can
impede tissue regeneration, nutrient recycling, and can cause tissue
damage, which is also a notable dysfunction in the elderly (reviewed
in30). Concordantly, astronauts display accelerated aging phenotypes
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) post-one-year missions
via
telomere
shortening
mechanics2,12,
suggesting
post-ﬂight
macrophages may also have an accelerated age phenotype, that is
possibly inﬂammatory12 (reviewed in31). However, previous work
described reduced monocyte expression levels of pro-inﬂammatory
TNF-α, IL-6, and immunoregulatory IL-10 upon LPS ex vivo

missions
(13–16 day missions, STS-124, STS-125, and STS-126)32. Differences
in study outcomes may be a due to variables including duration in
spaceﬂight and types of mission exposures (i.e., shuttle versus ISS).
Additionally, while recovery to baseline macrophage function may be
achieved post-ﬂight on Earth, the time frame to recovery is an
important consideration for future exploration missions on lunar and
Martian surfaces.
Macrophages are also critically involved in directing type-
speciﬁc adaptive immunity via antigen presentation and the
production of lymphocyte differentiation cytokines (reviewed
in33). Spaceﬂight can alter adaptive immunity through impaired T
cell function7 and impaired lymphocyte maturation (reviewed
in34), both of which can cause immune deﬁciency. As macro-
phages play an important role in antigen presentation and can
shape lymphocyte effector cell phenotypes, we hypothesize that
altered macrophages may signiﬁcantly alter adaptive immune
phenotypes observed during spaceﬂight. However, due to the
complexity of performing in-ﬂight studies to characterize immu-
nological synapses or macrophage-lymphocyte communication
processes, these studies have been lacking to date. Nonetheless,
one study has characterized the potential for peripheral immune
tolerance processes being disrupted in space-ﬂown mice (15-day
mission),
whereby
antigen-speciﬁc
tolerance,
mediated
by
antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, was compro-
mised and elevated inﬂammation was recorded post-ﬂight35. This
study highlights the potential for fundamental antigen presenta-
tion/processing mechanisms being compromised in-ﬂight. Thus,
deﬁcits in antigen processing and presentation can inﬂuence
inappropriate effector lymphocyte establishment, which may be
the basis for reported adaptive immune dysfunctions in ﬂight7,
although additional studies are required (Fig. 2).
Most studies that characterize macrophage lineage biology and
function in response to the spaceﬂight environment are limited to
post-ﬂight outcomes, although some have characterized in-ﬂight
cell counts and cytokine/chemokine proﬁles. As such, additional
experimental evidence is necessary to fully characterize unique
phenotypes of monocytes and macrophages in spaceﬂight,
including functional outcomes on lymphocyte populations.
TISSUE-SPECIFIC MACROPHAGE LINEAGES IN SPACEFLIGHT
As described above, macrophages can undergo alterations in the
spaceﬂight
environment,
which
may
in
part
contribute
to
spaceﬂight-induced conditions. Specialized tissue-speciﬁc macro-
phage lineages in the spaceﬂight environment are less characterized,
such as microglia of the CNS or bone osteoclasts (reviewed in36). Yet,
there are some intriguing spaceﬂight environmental consequences
on these specialized tissue macrophage lineages that have been
identiﬁed, displaying similarities to known terrestrial disorders. For
instance, the spaceﬂight environment (12-day mission murine OSTEO
payload) has known effects on osteoclasts resulting in osteoclasto-
genesis and increased bone resorption37, which may play an
important role in exacerbating bone loss in spaceﬂight, resembling
osteoporosis (reviewed in38,39). Furthermore, microglia are brain-
resident macrophages that are responsible for the maintenance of
brain homeostasis by surveying the microenvironment in a resting
state. However, when activated, microglia can play a contributing
role in neuroinﬂammation causing bystander tissue damage if
unresolved (reviewed in40). Similar to features resembling Alzheimer’s
disease41, microglia can be activated by space-relevant galactic
cosmic rays (GCR) doses both in vitro and in vivo models of cosmic
radiation (reviewed in42,43), leading to cognitive deﬁcits and
neuroinﬂammation in mice44. Interestingly, the removal of microglial
populations through cellular depletion in mice can prevent sex-
speciﬁc GCR effects such as learning deﬁcits and phagocytic
activation45, and indicates a potential target for neuroinﬂammatory
regulation in spaceﬂight-associated radiation models (reviewed in46).

various specialized macrophage lineages in spaceﬂight and asso-
ciated terrestrial disorders.
There are several research gaps characterizing macrophage
lineages in the spaceﬂight environment and are of interest for
future spaceﬂight studies (Table 2). For example, Kupffer cells of
the liver are part of the hepatic macrophage system and play an
important role in liver immunological tolerance, producing IL-10
and high PD-L1 expression (reviewed in47). Reduced rat Kupffer
cell populations have been previously reported in hepatic tissues
post-spaceﬂight (14-day mission)48, suggesting possible disruption
in the maintenance of liver homeostasis and may play a signiﬁcant
role in immunological resolution during inﬂammatory-induced
conditions in spaceﬂight (reviewed in49), however, more studies
are necessary. Similarly, macrophages within other less character-
ized tissues, such as the pancreas, kidneys, and adrenals also may
play important roles, due to parallel terrestrial disorder overlaps
with spaceﬂight-associated conditions of insulin resistance, meta-
bolic disorders (reviewed in50) and renal stone formation risk51,52.
However more studies elucidating the role of specialized tissue-
resident macrophages lineages are required.
INFLUENCE OF MICROGRAVITY ON MACROPHAGE LINEAGES
Ground-based, terrestrial analogs of microgravity that assess cells in
culture include rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors or rotary cell
culture systems (RCCS), and clinostats (2D/3D) or random positioning

machines. Other possible analogs that are less utilized include, drop
towers and parabolic ﬂight (reviewed in53). As described above, HU
and partial weight-bearing suspension are standard rodent models
used to simulate microgravity, while head-down tilt bead rest and
wet/dry immersions are used in humans (reviewed in53,54). However,
analogs can produce disparate responses to true microgravity
experienced in spaceﬂight on the ISS, therefore highlighting the
importance of utilizing the ISS for future experiments in this ﬁeld. For
example, 2D clinostats can possibly induce spurious ﬂuid motion and
shear stress55, which can have negative immune cell consequences.
Further, unless otherwise designed, ground-based microgravity
analogs do not include other risk factors that are experienced in
the spaceﬂight environment, such as ionizing radiation and elevated
carbon dioxide levels, for example1. Therefore, accurately modeling
immune function in simulated microgravity analogs that is similar to
spaceﬂight requires careful attention to experimental design.
Considering
mechanical
and
intercellular
communication
between heterogeneous populations of cells and the hypothesis
that the cellular cytoskeleton has built-in mechanisms for sensing
mechanical stress (reviewed in56,57), it is possible that macro-
phages may also be sensitive to mechanical stress. Mechanical
stress includes stretch and compressive forces, and hydrostatic
shear pressures that are experienced within multiple tissue types
(reviewed in58), where macrophages reside. Mechanical unloading,
or decreased mechanical stress on cells and tissues can simulate
microgravity (reviewed in59). At the cellular level, mechanical
unloading causes pathological phenotypes via altered cellular
mechanotransduction
pathways,
which
may
reﬂect
cellular
changes in astronauts (reviewed in57). Although mechanosensi-
tivity of macrophages in vivo has not been characterized in
spaceﬂight, several human spaceﬂight missions report altered
cytokine expression proﬁles2,4,8,28,32,60, which may be a response
of altered mechanotransductive signaling cascades in macro-
phages (reviewed in26,57). These ﬁndings underscore complex and
dynamic responses in the spaceﬂight environment and highlight a
gap in knowledge that requires further studies.
Microgravity analogs can cause actin reorganization and
changes in cytoskeletal and nuclear morphology61, which may
impact transcriptional or replicative programs. In addition, the
plasma membrane physically couples to cytoskeletal anchoring
proteins and contains Piezo mechanosensitive channels that
transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical signals (reviewed
in62), which may be an important target for future microgravity
research. In line with this, the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway
involved in actin polymerization and multiple other signal
transduction cascades, is downregulated in HPC concomitantly
differentiating into macrophages (12-day differentiation process)
both in simulated microgravity conditions (12-days) and space-
ﬂight
(12-day
mission)24,
indicating
aberrant
cell
signaling,
impaired macrophage maturation, and cytoskeletal disturbances
are inﬂuenced by the microgravity environment. In line with this,
signaling pathways such as STAT3, P38, JNK, FAK-ERK, Rho/ROCK,
AKT, CREB, NF-κB, RAC-WAVE-Arp2/3 (reviewed in63,64) and MRTF-
A/SRF (reviewed in64,65), may all be engaged in microgravity,
which also requires further studies.
Monocyte/macrophage migratory behavior is also altered in
both simulated microgravity and spaceﬂight conditions. For
example, integrin intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),
which regulates cellular migration and extravasation, is induced
in differentiated U937 macrophage-like cells and BV-2 microglia
cells, following rotating wall vessel and parabolic ﬂight (reviewed
in66). ICAM-1 is also elevated at 120 h of spaceﬂight67, which may
result in enhanced extravasation processes and immune activity.
Thus, microgravity poses a unique and varied environmental
change that may require quantitative, comparative, and multi-
factorial approaches to tease out pathological macrophage
mechanisms at the cellular, tissue, and physiological scales.
COSMIC IONIZING RADIATION AND MACROPHAGE
DESTABILIZATION
Exposure to photon and particle cosmic radiation, including
gamma, X-ray, solar particle events (SPE) and GCR, may further
inﬂuence macrophage dysfunction during deep space missions.
The complex space radiation environment is nearly impossible to
simulate on Earth, thus research on space-related ionizing
radiation has historically utilized gamma rays and single ion
particles68. With the introduction of the newly designed simulated
GCR (33-ion sequential beam and simpliﬁed 5-ion beam) and SPE
dosing schemes (including protracted and acute exposures)
developed by the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at
Brookhaven National Laboratory, more opportunities are available
to
simulate
some
aspects
of
the
deep
space
radiation
environment69,70.
GCRs are composed of high-energy charged particles, primarily
protons, helium ions, and high mass/high energy (HZE) parti-
cles68,70, all of which can have detrimental effects on biology
(reviewed in71). Characterization of monocyte and macrophage
responses to GCRs or their components currently remains
inadequately deﬁned. On the one hand, via the metric of
apoptosis, macrophages are more radioresistant compared to
monocytes, while the lymphoid lineage is even more radio-
sensitive72. Mice exposed to simulated 5-ion simpliﬁed GCR
(0.5 Gy) and SPE (1 Gy) irradiation with and without HU displayed
no differences in monocyte counts, although reduction in
lymphocytes were observed 24-hours post-exposure3. Other
studies have reported elevated blood monocyte counts seven-
days post-GCR irradiation at comparable doses (0.5 Gy), which
positively correlated with impaired spatial learning at ﬁve months
post-exposure in mice45. This suggests that radiation-mediated
damage during myelopoiesis may impact cognitive performance
post-irradiation. This effect might be primarily mediated by brain-
resident macrophages (microglia), as depleting microglia also
improved cognitive outcomes after irradiation45(reviewed in73,74).
Although not a comprehensive analog to space radiation,
cancer radiotherapy studies have provided some insight into
immune phenotypes following ionizing radiation. Indeed, macro-
phages play an important role in both regulation and resolution of
inﬂammation, for instance certain polarized types of macrophages
are prominent in the progression of cancer, while radiotherapy
may promote antitumor phenotypes (reviewed in75). Many
characteristic inﬂammatory proﬁles produced by macrophages
depend on cellular abundance and response to danger-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs), produced from radiation-induced
DNA damage76. Thus, in spaceﬂight, damaged DNA may trigger
DAMP
receptor
pathways
inducing
inﬂammatory
mediator
production2–4,8.
Notably, space mission-relevant doses of X-ray irradiation (0.1,
0.5, 1, and 2 Gy) did not alter macrophage phenotypes77.
Interestingly, dose-dependence did alter macrophage phenotypes
when cells were cultured in the presence of radiation-conditioned
ﬁbroblast
supernatant,
suggesting
physiological
mediators,
received from other cells were necessary to generate unique
cellular phenotypes in response to radiation77. Thus, the complex
nature of the space radiation environment and its energies, doses,
and dose rates make assessing macrophages function a difﬁcult
task. Future studies on this topic will require better characteriza-
tion of macrophage polarity and responses following acute and
protracted doses, combination spaceﬂight exposures, and long-
itudinal immune sampling.
ISOLATION, CONFINEMENT, AND EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL
STRESSORS
Isolation, conﬁnement, and extreme (ICE) environments also pose
unique risks to crewmembers on exploration missions78. Operational

on-board stressors that fall into this category include circadian
misalignment, social isolation, and closed/hostile environments, all of
which may impact macrophage biology. Spaceﬂight and ground
analogs indicate that ICE may disrupt circadian rhythms critical to
immune functions (reviewed in79,80). More speciﬁcally, ICE may
impact
circadian
misalignment
by
manifesting
disruptions
in
monocyte and macrophage molecular clocks (reviewed in81). Indeed,
light (in the form of visible sunlight) is a dominant environmental cue
for many biological clock physiological processes, such as sleep/
wake,
endocrine
hormone
release,
metabolic
processes,
and
temperature regulation (reviewed in82). Circadian misalignment, as
a result from irregular light cues in spaceﬂight, can cause deviations
from normal cycling and may have profound impacts on multiple
physiological systems83. In line with this, circadian misalignment may
innately impact immune function. Indeed, there have been reports
describing cell-autonomous clock gene expressions in rat natural
killer cells84 and mouse peritoneal macrophages85. Notably, in the
absence of the core clock component protein cryptochrome (CRY),
elevated proinﬂammatory cytokine expression mediated through NF-
κB activation has been reported86. Further as mentioned above,
neuroendocrine hormone release is regulated by the circadian
system. For example, glucocorticoid release peaks in the early
morning in response to light (diurnal), which integrates with cyclic
systemic immunity (reviewed in87), suggesting neuroendocrine
system crosstalk with immunity. Indeed, glucocorticoids can also
directly impact macrophage polarization phenotypes, indirectly
linking immune regulation to circadian cycling88. Therefore, modula-
tion of glucocorticoid production that aligns with circadian cycle
regulation in astronauts on deep space missions should be
considered in countermeasure designs. Furthermore, diurnal sample
collection metadata should also be evaluated during immune
response analysis and considered for future experimental design.
Social isolation in mice in combination with HU caused population
shifting in leukocytes, including neutrophils and lymphocytes, while
monocyte populations were unaltered89. These studies further
support crosstalk with the neuroendocrine hypothalamus-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis is involved in immune regulation. In addition,
immune differentials reported in the Mars500 isolation project in
humans indicate the effects of extreme isolation on gut microbiome
maintenance and immunity, a site populated by macrophages90. In
line with this, multiple other isolation analogs, including NEEMO,
Antarctica, and MOON-2015 have assessed the inﬂuence of isolation
on macrophage lineage phenotypes (primarily monocytes), collec-
tively indicating differential outcomes are observed during- and post-
study collections (reviewed in91). Differential outcomes may be due
to the unique microbial environment present in each analog, further
adding to the complexity of macrophage phenotype characteriza-
tions. Thus, an important future research direction would be to
determine the extent of spaceﬂight-caused macrophage dysfunction
and the mechanistic underpinnings involved in macrophage function
as a result of ICE-related operational stressors, along with considering
environmental microbial inﬂuence.
HYPERCAPNIA AND MACROPHAGE FUNCTION
Increased partial pressure of CO2 aboard the ISS might also
contribute to spaceﬂight-induced immune dysfunction. It is well-
accepted that elevated levels of environmental CO2 can cause
hypercapnia (elevated blood/tissue CO2 levels). Elevated levels of
CO2 impair macrophage ability to defend against foreign
invaders by inhibiting the production of cytokines critical for
antimicrobial host defense, such as TNF and IL-692. Hypercapnia
also downregulates genes associated with innate immunity,
antiviral response, and cytokine signaling in both human and
mouse macrophages93, while on the cellular level, hypercapnia
has been shown to cause macrophage apoptosis and decreased
phagocytic activity92,94. For example, hypercapnia can increase
inﬂuenza A virus replication and inhibit antiviral gene and protein
expression in mouse macrophages, which is dependent on the
activity of Akt95. Indeed, Akt isoforms can modulate Akt activity
levels in macrophages and their polarization phenotypes96;
therefore, Akt may be a potential therapeutic target to enhance
macrophage host defense. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest
deﬁcits in macrophage immunity can be caused by hypercapnic
conditions. This emphasizes a critical risk to consider for long-
duration ( > 1 year) exploration missions, where exposures to
elevated CO2 levels may be experienced for prolonged periods
of time.
MACROPHAGES AND FUTURE LUNAR MISSION
CONSIDERATIONS
Lunar dust poses a serious challenge for exploration missions to
the moon, but the limited availability of authentic lunar dust
samples makes it difﬁcult to conduct biological experiments on
Earth. Studies of Apollo 14 lunar dust exposure in rats demon-
strated lung toxicity when inhaled (reviewed in97). Further, an
in vitro study assessed the behavior of a transformed macrophage
cell line in the presence of SiO2 and Al2O3 (analogs of lunar dust).
In the presence of these mineral particles, phagocytosis was
impaired98 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was
increased99. In addition, mouse alveolar macrophage counts
decrease following lunar dust exposure, along with neutrophil
aggregation100, suggesting increased cell death pathways and
inﬂammation in the lung microenvironment may be involved in
the pathophysiology of lunar dust exposure. Since macrophages
play a major role in phagocytosis and defense against toxins,
further studies on macrophage function following lunar dust and
other celestial dust exposures are essential for mitigation agendas
on future lunar missions.
FUTURE OUTLOOK AND SUMMARY
A growing body of experimental evidence, reviewed in this
monograph, indicates that monocytes and macrophages are
altered by the spaceﬂight environment. These ﬁndings have
implications for a wide range of physiological processes, including
innate immunity, acquired immunity, host defense, and tissue
remodeling. Aside from spaceﬂight, the studies described in this
review involve the examination of a single aspect of the space
environment (such as weightlessness, space radiation or elevated
CO2 levels). Future experiments involving combinations of space-
ﬂight stressors, such as elevated CO2 levels combined with
simulated space radiation and gravitational changes, would
enable a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of
the spaceﬂight environment on macrophage function. Further
investigations of cell- and tissue-speciﬁc macrophage responses
and phenotypes are also necessary to assess tissue-speciﬁc
pathologies that connect cellular studies to human disease
processes on long-duration missions in deep space. Considering
the immune system “computes” the state of health throughout
the body (reviewed in96) additional assessment of other immune
cell types in the hematopoietic tree is also necessary. In brief,
fundamental studies on macrophages in space have begun to lay
the groundwork for the development of targeted counter-
measures that optimize macrophage function and are needed to
address clinical challenges that arise as space exploration moves
beyond low Earth orbit.
