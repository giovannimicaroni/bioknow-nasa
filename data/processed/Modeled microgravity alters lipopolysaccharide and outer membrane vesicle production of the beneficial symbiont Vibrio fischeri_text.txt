Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated
microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio ﬁscheri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from
V. ﬁscheri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled
microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS
released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated
with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to ﬂagellar motility. Mutants of
V. ﬁscheri defective in the production and rotation of their ﬂagella show signiﬁcant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but
levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-
membrane integrity of V. ﬁscheri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-
membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be
altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceﬂight.

INTRODUCTION
All animals form beneﬁcial associations with microbes, and these
symbioses,
collectively
called
the
microbiome,
constitute
a
powerful determinant of development, health, and ﬁtness1,2.
Indeed, alterations in the composition of the microbiome, its
secretion of bioactive metabolites, as well as the symbionts’
resultant with host systems (e.g., nervous, immune, endocrine)
have been found to correlate with a variety of illnesses and
disorders2–4. Understanding how mutualistic microbes adapt to
stressful conditions within animal hosts, including humans,
therefore, represents a crucial topic for microbiome research.
One environment
that presents
numerous
challenges to
host–microbe homeostasis is spaceﬂight5. In particular, the
microgravity conditions (10−6 × g) that astronauts experience
during spaceﬂight have been shown to disrupt the normal
physiology of the human body, including the intestinal micro-
biome6,7. This dysbiotic response is characterized by a decline in
gut bacteria predicted to be protective, including Biﬁdobacterium
and Lactobacillus spp.; the increased abundance of opportunistic
pathogens like Escherichia coli, Enterobacteria spp., and Clostridia
spp.; as well as shifts in the relative proportions of dominant taxa
from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes6–12.
In addition to measuring the relative abundance of various
bacterial populations, many studies have also sought to determine
the impact of the spaceﬂight on the physiology of those taxa. In
this regard, microgravity and microgravity-analog conditions have
been found to increase the resistance of opportunistic pathogens,
such as E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to acid, heat, osmotic,
and oxidative stresses13–15. Cultivation in these conditions is also
known to promote bioﬁlm formation and enhance the virulence of
certain pathogens, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi-
murium16–19 and Serratia marcescens20. Though much progress
has been made in delineating how pathogenic microbes respond
to this unique stressor, the larger discussion of how beneﬁcial
microbes respond to microgravity has only recently begun to be
examined21–27.
One mutualistic association that has emerged as a tractable
model by which to examine beneﬁcial host–microbe interactions
under modeled and natural microgravity conditions is the
monospeciﬁc symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid,
Euprymna
scolopes,
and
its
bioluminescent
partner
Vibrio
ﬁscheri21,24,28. Upon hatching, V. ﬁscheri colonizes a specialized
organ, known as the light organ, within the host animal and
induces an irreversible remodeling of the symbiotic tissues29. The
remodeling is marked by a pronounced apoptotic cell death event
throughout the light organ’s superﬁcial, ciliated epithelium30,31, a
structure that is used to recruit symbiosis-competent V. ﬁscheri
from the environment and facilitate the onset of the association.
Two microbe-associated molecular pattern signals (MAMPs)
that have been identiﬁed as the primary mediators of the
V. ﬁscheri-induced apoptotic event in E. scolopes are LPS and the
peptidoglycan-derived monomer, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT)32,33.
These two MAMPs work synergistically to induce apoptosis and
regression of the light organ’s ciliated epithelium during the onset
of symbiosis33,34. Early-stage apoptosis within the host tissues,
however, is primarily attributed to LPS32, and most of the LPS
released by V. ﬁscheri is embedded in outer-membrane vesicles
(OMVs) that are shed via rotation of the bacterium’s sheathed,
polar, ﬂagella (Fig. 1a–c)35,36. The rapid onset of MAMP-inducible
phenotypes, combined with the binary nature of the light organ

symbiosis, has rendered the squid-vibrio system a uniquely
informative model for the study of animal-microbial mutualisms
in microgravity22.
Several ground-based systems exist that enable microgravity-like
conditions to be modeled, including high-aspect ratio vessels
(HARVs). HARVs mimic the quiescent, low-shear, ﬂuid conditions of
spaceﬂight when rotated around a horizontal axis (Fig. 1d)22,37.
Alternatively, rotation around a vertical axis is used to control for
system-speciﬁc effects under normal Earth gravity conditions22,38.
This low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment has
been used to successfully mimic microgravity for decades, and has
been correlated to results obtained during actual spaceﬂight13,23,37.
Previous work with the squid-vibrio symbiosis using LSMMG has
found that the normal symbiont-induced development of the light
organ is altered by LSMMG21,23,24,27. Speciﬁcally, modeled micro-
gravity accelerates both the onset and peak of apoptosis in both
symbiotic and aposymbiotic, LPS-treated hatchlings21. Given the role
of LPS in the normal bacteria-induced development of E. scolopes,
these ﬁndings raised the possibility that LSMMG may alter MAMP-
mediated channels of host–microbe communication. MAMPs are a
crucial component of both beneﬁcial and pathogenic interactions39;
therefore, in this study, we examined the impact of LSMMG on the
release of LPS and OMVs by V. ﬁscheri, and assessed the overall
physiology of the symbiont when cultivated under microgravity-like
conditions. Examining the effects of modeled microgravity on
beneﬁcial microbes has the potential to both provide new insight
on the underlying mechanisms of microgravity-induced dysbiosis
and further our understanding of mutualistic host-microbe interac-
tions during spaceﬂight.
RESULTS
Shedding of V. ﬁscheri-derived LPS increased during
exponential growth under LSMMG conditions compared to
gravity controls
To determine the potential impact of modeled microgravity on LPS
release during growth, cultures of wild-type V. ﬁscheri ES114 were
grown in HARV reactors in the LSMMG and gravity positions
(Fig. 1d) and monitored at 2–4-h intervals. The growth curves
were characteristic of several microbes cultivated under LSMMG,
including V. ﬁscheri, exhibiting increased growth rate during
exponential phase compared to gravity controls (Supplementary
Fig. 1)23,27,40. At each growth interval, the V. ﬁscheri cells were
removed from the culture media and the level of exogenous LPS
shed by the bacteria was measured and compared using two
independent assays. First, the colorimetric ToxinSensor Chromo-
genic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) endotoxin assay, which
measures the biological reactivity of the lipid A moiety of LPS, was
used to measure reactogenic LPS in the cell-free medium ﬁltrate.
The second method, the Purpald assay, is based on the periodate
oxidation of sugars of the core regions of the LPS molecule41, and
was used on the same, cell-free media ﬁltrate to quantify the total
amount of LPS. Although complementary, these two assays target
different components of the LPS molecule42.
During exponential growth in the HARV reactors, V. ﬁscheri cells
released signiﬁcantly more LPS under LSMMG conditions than
gravity controls even after being normalized by optical density, an
indicator of cell mass (Fig. 2a). Levels of reactogenic LPS in the
surrounding media, as determined by the LAL endotoxin assay,
showed a pronounced increase beginning 10 h post inoculation
(Fig. 2a). The signiﬁcantly higher levels of LPS released from the
LSMMG-grown cells continued until ~18–20 h, after which no
differences in LPS levels were observed between the two growth
conditions. Measurement of total LPS by the Purpald assay
showed a similar increase, with the concentrations of total LPS
shedding in LSMMG cultivars compared to gravity controls higher

at all tested time points between 8 and 24 h post inoculation
(Fig. 2b).
Increased LPS release during modeled microgravity is
correlated, but not completely dependent on, cell motility
Previous work has shown that most of the LPS released by
V. ﬁscheri is embedded in OMVs that are derived from rotation of
the outer-membrane-sheathed, polar ﬂagella35,36,43. This result led
us to determine whether LSMMG stimulates bacterial motility,
which would ostensibly increase vesiculation and, as a corollary,
the shedding of LPS. Interestingly, the motility of wild-type cells
grown under either LSMMG or gravity conditions showed no
statistical differences when examined using direct microscopic
video analysis or soft-agar motility assays (Supplementary Fig. 2).
In addition, we also compared the amount of LPS shedding by two
motility-deﬁcient V. ﬁscheri mutants, motB1 and ﬂhA, grown under
gravity and LSMMG conditions. Mutants defective in motB1, which
encodes for a ﬂagellar motor protein, do form ﬂagella but are
unable to rotate them, whereas ﬂhA mutants are defective in the
synthesis of ﬂagella44,45.
The motility mutants shed signiﬁcantly less LPS than the wild-
type V. ﬁscheri ES114 under both LSMMG and gravity conditions
when normalized by optical density (Fig. 3). In wild-type cells,
concentrations of reactionogenic LPS ranged between 5 × 104 and
2.5 × 105 EU per mL of media (Fig. 2a). In the motility mutants,
however, the levels of reactogenic LPS were ~10-fold lower at
each time point tested compared to the parent strain (Fig. 3a). By
14 h, however, there was a signiﬁcant difference between the level
of LPS measured in the LSMMG and gravity conditions in the
motility mutants. Like the wild type, LSMMG-treated mutant cells
exhibited signiﬁcantly higher levels of LPS in both motility
mutants compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3a). In addition, the
motB1 mutants shed signiﬁcantly higher levels of LPS in the
LSMMG conditions compared to the ﬂhA mutant at 14, 16, and
20 h post inoculation (Fig. 3a). These differences were also
independently conﬁrmed with the Purpald assay (Fig. 3b) and
suggest potential differences between the relative abundances
between the components of the LPS molecule that are shed under
LSMMG conditions.
The
motility
mutants
displayed

growth
increases compared to the parent strain, ES114 (Supplementary
Fig. 1a–c) and to determine whether there were differences in
cell size between the strains, cells collected from 12-h HARV
cultures of wild type, motB1, and ﬂhA mutants were stained with
1% crystal violet compare cell size under LSMMG and gravity
treatments and observed with microscopy. Analyses of cell size
revealed no signiﬁcant difference between conditions or strains,
suggesting optical density readings were directly comparable
between LSMMG and gravity treatments for all strains (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1d).
Higher levels of LPS in LSMMG correlate with increased OMV
production
To more fully understand the mechanics of increased LPS release
under LSMMG conditions, the production of OMVs was examined
under modeled microgravity. Almost all of the LPS released from
V. ﬁscheri cells has been shown to be associated with OMVs, which
are produced largely due to ﬂagellar rotation35,36. Therefore, we
also examined whether OMV number and size were altered under
the modeled microgravity conditions. Cultures of the wild type,
motB1, and ﬂhA strains were grown in LSMMG or gravity
conditions and cell-free ﬁltrates were evaluated at 12, 14, and
16 h post inoculation using nanoparticle tracking analysis. These
times were chosen as they represent growth points with the
largest discrepancies in LPS content between treatments observed
across all three strains.
Nanoparticle analysis revealed a positive association between
symbiont OMV vesiculation and modeled microgravity condi-
tions. Speciﬁcally, the LSMMG ﬁltrates of wild type, ﬂhA, and
motB1 were found to contain signiﬁcantly more OMV particles
per mL than the gravity controls (Fig. 4a). Under both conditions,
OMV concentration was observed to increase over time, with
both motB1 and ﬂhA generating diminished vesicular yields
relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 4a). In addition, by 14 h OMVs
derived from LSMMG cultures were found to be signiﬁcantly
larger than gravity controls (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Table 1;
Supplementary Dataset 1). At 16 h, the average size of OMVs for
the
modeled
microgravity
cultures
was
40.72 ± 0.092 nm,
whereas nanoparticle size averaged only 37.10 ± 0.092 nm for
gravity controls (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, in the motB1
and ﬂhA motility mutants the means of OMVs from LSMMG-
treated
cultures
were
45.35 ± 0.068
and
43.05 ± 0.065 nm,
respectively, whereas the mean size of gravity-treated OMVs
was 40.72 ± 0.052 (motB1) and 38.16 ± 0.056 nm (ﬂhA). Differ-
ences were also observed in the abundance of certain sized
particles. Gravity samples tended to contain a higher proportion
of smaller OMVs (diameter < 40 nm), whereas those cultivated in
LSMMG exhibited a more even distribution (Supplementary Fig.
3). All isolated OMVs, whether they were derived from gravity or
LSMMG conditions, exhibited a comparable ability to induce
apoptosis and matched previously published levels of LPS and
OMV-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. 4)21,35.

V. ﬁscheri become increasingly sensitive to cell membrane-
affecting agents in LSMMG
Although motility-dependent vesiculation is characteristic of
species with sheathed ﬂagella, such as V. ﬁscheri36, all Gram-
negative bacteria invariably produce OMVs by outer-membrane
blebbing. OMV-blebbing is modulated by both external envelope
stress and structural deﬁciencies in the bacterial cell wall46.
Accordingly, the discovery that ﬂagellar function does not, in fact,
fully
explain
the
model
microgravity-associated
differences
observed in LPS-shedding or OMV release led us to hypothesize
that LSMMG conditions may impact the integrity of the Gram-
negative outer membrane. To investigate this, the susceptibility of
V. ﬁscheri toward a variety of cell membrane-affecting agents was
compared in cells grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions, for
the wild-type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h. Three
speciﬁc agents were used to disrupt different components of the
Gram-negative cell envelope. First, the cationic antibiotic poly-
myxin B was used, which binds to Gram-negative LPS and
weakens
the
packing
of

molecules
in
the
outer
membrane47. Second, cells were exposed to the anionic detergent
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which disrupts ionic interactions
and
causes
bacterial

membrane

at
high
concentrations48. Last, cells were also exposed to a dilute solution
of Triton X-100 for 1 min, which is a non-ionic detergent that
disrupts lipid–lipid interactions49. After exposure, cell growth was
assessed with optical density (Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6)
and plated to assess cell viability (Fig. 6).
Dose–response curves with 1–10 μg per mL polymyxin B and
0.1–1.0% v/v SDS revealed a concentration-dependent effect on
bacterial growth in both LSMMG and gravity conditions. This
effect was more pronounced in the LSMMG-treated strains at all
time points tested (Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6); LSMMG-
treated V. ﬁscheri generally showed increased sensitivity to
membrane-disrupting agents. Despite showing different baseline
sensitivities, the mutant strains also appeared more susceptible to
the polymyxin B and SDS agents under LSMMG conditions
compared to wild-type cells at all time points tested, with the
polymyxin B treatment producing the most damaging effects to
the motility mutants (Fig. 5, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). Plating
of cells treated with polymyxin B- and SDS-treated cells revealed
comparable results (Fig. 6) indicating that, regardless of strain, the
viability of those cells exposed to polymyxin B were more
negatively impacted when grown under LSMMG conditions.
Similar results were also observed when cells were treated with
Triton X-100. Cells of LSMMG-cultivated V. ﬁscheri, regardless of
strain, were also found to be more susceptible to the bactericidal
effects of 0.05% Triton X-100, exhibiting more lysis than the
gravity controls after 1 min of exposure (Fig. 7). To conﬁrm that
the results observed during these HARV experiments were not the
product of changes to the background pH of the SWT media
under LSMMG or gravity conditions, the pH was regularly
monitored, and no signiﬁcant changes to the pH were observed
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
DISCUSSION
Over the coming decade, human-led exploration of space will
likely move
beyond
low
Earth
orbit into
deeper
space50.
Maintaining astronaut ﬁtness during these long-duration space
operations will require a detailed understanding of the micro-
biome under non-terrestrial conditions. To address this emerging
issue in space biology, we used the HARV platform to model the
effects of microgravity on V. ﬁscheri, a beneﬁcial microbe known
to form symbiotic associations along animal epithelia. Results
from this study indicated that (i) LSMMG conditions increased the
shedding
of
bacterial
LPS
and
associated
OMVs
into
the
surrounding media; (ii) the size of the OMV particles released
during LSMMG were larger than gravity controls; (iii) ﬂagellar
motility in V. ﬁscheri accounted for most of the overall OMV
production, but was not necessary for increases in LPS shedding
under LSMMG conditions; and (iv) the cell membranes of V. ﬁscheri
cells were more susceptible to disruption when cultivated under
model microgravity conditions.
In Gram-negative bacteria, LPS is localized to the outer
membrane and consists of a hydrophobic lipid A moiety, a core
polysaccharide, and an O-antigen, or outward-projecting sugar
chain of variable length51,52. LPS represents one of several MAMPs
used by bacteria to either evade or communicate with their
eukaryotic counterparts53. There has been an intense effort in
recent years to understand how LPS is recognized by the host
immune system through pattern recognition receptors54, and how
this immune response is altered under microgravity conditions55,56.
The ﬁnding that symbiotic V. ﬁscheri sheds more LPS under
LSMMG conditions closely parallels previous studies that reported
that microgravity analogs increases endotoxin load derived from
the intestinal microbiota in rodents55,56. For example, in previous
studies using the hindlimb unloading rodent model, a well-
established method to simulate musculoskeletal disuse observed

in spaceﬂight57,58, results indicated that both LPS and the
associated host-derived lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were
elevated in rodent serum under hindlimb unloading56. Levels of
circulating LPS were further increased with concurrent exposure
to proton or gamma radiation, another environmental hazard of
spaceﬂight55. Although the increased levels in the serum were
thought to be the result of breakdown of the gut epithelial barrier
during hindlimb unloading, the root cause of the overall increased
levels of LPS shedding by the microbiota into the host serum was
not assessed55,56.
Interestingly, the results observed in V. ﬁscheri differ from other
host-associated taxa, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimur-
ium17. In previous studies, HARV-cultivated Salmonella exhibited
signiﬁcantly diminished levels of LPS O-antigen in LSMMG lysates,
accompanied by a down-regulation of the rfbP, rfbM, and rfbI genes
involved
in O-antigen
biosynthesis
and
ligation17.
However,
V. ﬁscheri lacks homologs to these O-antigen synthesis genes59. In
V. ﬁscheri the O-antigen is comprised of a single pentasaccharide
comprised of a two yersiniose, one 8-epi-legionaminic acid, and two
n-acetyl-L-fucosamine residues60. The two quantitative techniques
used in this study, LAL and Purpald assays do not directly measure
the O-antigen so the differences between the two studies could
reﬂect the methods used to quantify the LPS molecule as well as
the different architectures of the LPS molecules. Alternatively, the
differences in LPS release between the taxa under LSMMG
conditions may simply reﬂect the fact that Salmonella does not
have sheathed ﬂagella, whereas V. ﬁscheri has a membranous
sheath that requires more torque to rotate, thereby releasing
more LPS61,62.
In this study, the increased shedding of LPS from the bacterium
V. ﬁscheri under LSMMG conditions coincided with the exponential
growth of the cultures (Fig. 2). In many taxa, including V. ﬁscheri,
higher cell densities and growth rates are observed under
modeled microgravity conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1a, e)63,64.
It has been proposed that the quiescent environment of
LSMMG and continuous reorientation of the cell are altering the
extracellular mass transfer of nutrients and waste, thereby
impacting the cell’s growth rate37,65. Although V. ﬁscheri is motile

and there could be some mixing and disruption to the low-shear
environment, V. ﬁscheri may be accustomed to microgravity-like
conditions as the symbionts regularly encounter low-shear
environments when interfacing with the epithelial brush border
of the host squid light organ tissues. Therefore, the observed
increased growth rate may simply reﬂect the natural growth
response for these symbiotic bacteria under low-shear stress
environments.
The increase in LPS shedding under modeled microgravity
conditions was also correlated to increases in the production of
OMVs. The release of OMVs is an important mechanism by which
bacteria interact with their environment66. OMVs derived from
Gram-negative bacteria are produced in all stages of growth, and
are frequently enriched with a range of bioreactive molecules,
including LPS, outer-membrane proteins, and peptidoglycan-
derivatives46,67,68. These discrete, enclosed structures are known
mediators of host–microbe communication in both pathogenic
and mutualistic associations69. In the squid-vibrio symbiosis, V.
ﬁscheri OMVs have previously been shown to induce hemocyte
trafﬁcking and apoptosis in the host symbiotic light organ, and are
important mediators of bacteria-induced development in the host
animal43,68. Both exogenous LPS and symbiont-derived OMVs can
induce signiﬁcant apoptosis in the light organ of uncolonized,
aposymbiotic hatchlings, even at low concentrations (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4). Thus, even small ﬂuctuations in the amount of OMVs
released in LSMMG could feasibly shift the timeline of symbiotic
development.
The observed increase in the release of LPS containing OMVs
during LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls may
suggest that the cells experience increased physiological stress in
the modeled microgravity conditions, in particular, during expo-
nential growth. Environmental stresses, such as temperature and
osmotic stresses, can increase vesiculation in numerous Gram-
negative bacteria70. The hypervesiculation of OMVs has been
shown to relieve the cell envelope from waste products and the
build-up of damaged, or misfolded, proteins, which accumulate
during stress and normal growth70,71. Interestingly, the increased in
OMV production under modeled microgravity conditions may also
provide a possible mechanism for the increase resistance to
environmental stresses and antibiotics observed in some microbes
grown under both natural and microgravity conditions37,72,73. The
ability of OMVs to quickly remove toxic material as well as absorb
and bind antimicrobial agents may also serve as an important
survival mechanism for microbes under stressful conditions, such as
spaceﬂight.
One of the major mechanisms by which V. ﬁscheri releases the
OMVs is through ﬂagellar rotation36. Certain members of the
genus Vibrio, along with several other microbiome-associated taxa,
such as Helicobacter, Brucella, and Campylobacter, produce ﬂagella
covered with a membrane-derived sheath74–79. These sheathed
ﬂagella have long been postulated to be a mechanism of
communication between microbes and host tissues43,69,80. During
rotation of the ﬂagella, OMVs can then be released from both the
tip and shaft of the ﬂagella81,82. Mutants defective in ﬂagella
production, or in the rotation of the ﬂagella, shed signiﬁcantly
fewer OMVs in comparison to wild-type strains36. This result is
consistent with the V. ﬁscheri strains grown in the HARV reactors,
suggesting ﬂagellar rotation is likely the primary, but not the only,
mechanism by which OMVs are being released in both LSMMG
and gravity conditions (Fig. 4). Interestingly, previous work found
that ﬂagella-driven increases in OMV release corresponded to
smaller OMV size, whereas our results found that LSMMG-
associated increases in OMV release corresponded with larger
OMV sizes36. This result suggests that LSMMG presents a novel
stress that stimulates a unique nonmotility- associated mechanism
for OMV production changes in V. ﬁscheri. In this vein, LSMMG
stimulates increased production of OMVs across a range of
bacteria with distinct lifestyles. Hypervesiculation has been
reported in gentamycin-challenged spaceﬂight cultures of E. coli,
a bacterium with unsheathed ﬂagella, which unlike sheathed
ﬂagella, do not mediate LPS release40.
Our ﬁndings indicate the increased release of OMVs under
modeled microgravity conditions may reﬂect changes in mem-
brane integrity. Bacteria have previously been found to have
altered cells membranes in both spaceﬂight and modeled
microgravity conditions. For example, irregularities in cell volume,

envelope

have
been
reported for E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus cultured in both
natural and modeled microgravity conditions63,83. The increased
susceptibility of V. ﬁscheri strains to membrane-disruption agents
(Figs. 5–7; Supplementary Figs. 5–6) further support the hypoth-
esis that the cell membrane of V. ﬁscheri is weakened by exposure
to modeled microgravity conditions. In addition, previous analysis
of the transcriptome of V. ﬁscheri cells showed no differential
expression of genes associated with LPS production during either
exponential or stationary phase when grown under LSMMG27.
Therefore, the results suggest that increases in the amount of LPS
shed by V. ﬁscheri occur primarily through mechanical means, and
not through changes in LPS biosynthesis. Additional research is
needed, however, to explore whether increased OMV shedding in
LSMMG causes, or is caused by, LSMMG-related changes in cell
membrane integrity.
Together, these results show that symbiotic microbes display
signiﬁcant physiological changes under modeled microgravity
conditions, leading to a change in release of MAMPs known
to
affect
host
biology,
which
may
have
implications
on
host–microbe interactions. For example, in symbiotic bobtail
squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions the onset
and peak of V. ﬁscheri-induced apoptosis of the light organ’s
superﬁcial epithelium occurs signiﬁcantly earlier than under
gravity controls, which could be explained by increased OMV
shedding21. Interestingly though, under LSMMG conditions there
is also a delay in the trafﬁcking of host immune cells within the
superﬁcial epithelium21, which is also typically triggered by
MAMPs and is dependent on the presence of the outer-
membrane protein OmpU in the OMVs43,68. This dissociated
response in the host animal under LSMMG suggests microgravity
may alter the content of the OMVs, or that the host may be
responding differently to these bacterial-derived signals under
microgravity, despite the lack of differences observed in the
extent of LPS-induced cell death between LSMMG and gravity
controls (Supplementary Fig. 4).
As many of the mechanisms that V. ﬁscheri use to communicate
with its host are shared amongst both pathogenic and beneﬁcial
microbes alike, our work provides important insight into how
microgravity-like conditions may alter host–microbe relationships
at the physiological level in general. Maintaining homeostasis of
the microbiome during spaceﬂight is critical for the long-term
host health, and these ﬁndings help build a critical framework to
begin to explore the speciﬁc interactions and responses that occur
between animals and their associated microbes.
METHODS
Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions
The strains of V. ﬁscheri used in this study include: wild-type V. ﬁscheri
ES11484; the non-motile, ﬂagellated, mutant motB1::Tn7ermR; and the non-
ﬂagellated mutant ﬂhA::Tn7ermR45. For all experiments, V. ﬁscheri was
grown in seawater tryptone broth (SWT; 70% ﬁltered ocean water
containing 5 g L−1 tryptone, 3 g L−1 yeast extract, and 32.5 mM glycerol)
at 28 ˚C with shaking. Where appropriate, media was supplemented with
erythromycin to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 μg per mL. Retention of the
transposon insertions in the motB1 and ﬂhA motility mutants was veriﬁed
for all experiments via soft-agar motility assays85. For assessments of
growth, the concentration of V. ﬁscheri was determined by reading the
optical density at 600 nm, as an OD600 of 1.0 has been previously shown by
plate counts to correspond with 3 × 108 cells per mL of culture84,86 and was
independently conﬁrmed in the HARVs. To ensure that background levels
of OMVs did not signiﬁcantly alter the OD600 readings, 1 mL of V. ﬁscheri
culture was ﬁltered to remove bacteria using a 0.22 µm syringe ﬁlter and
measured spectrophotometrically. No signiﬁcant (p < 0.0001) difference in
optical density was observed in the spent media from background
SWT media.
Electron microscopy
All scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and transmission electron
micrographs (TEM) were acquired at the University of Hawai’i Biological
Electron Microscopy Facility. For SEM, V. ﬁscheri were grown in SWT media
to mid-log phase (OD600 0.4–0.6) with shaking at 28 °C. For TEM, cells were
grown under similar conditions in LB salt (LBS) media containing 10 g L−1
tryptone, 5 g L−1 yeast extract, 342 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris at pH 7.5.
Samples visualized with SEM were ﬁxed with marine ﬁxative containing
2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 350 mM sucrose, 100 mM
sodium cacodylate at pH 7.6 for 1 h. The cells were then washed in 100 mM
sodium cacodylate buffer containing 400 mM sucrose and post-ﬁxed with
100 mM sodium cacodylate containing 1% osmium tetraoxide for 1 h. After
ﬁxation the cells were collected on a 0.22-μm ﬁlter, then serially
dehydrated in ethanol and dried with a Tousimis Samdri-795 critical point
dryer. Filters were mounted on aluminum stubs and sputter coated with a
Hummer 6.2 sputter coater, then imaged with a Hitachi S-4800 Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscope with accelerating voltage.
TEM was performed as previously described68. Brieﬂy, V. ﬁscheri cells
were ﬁxed, washed, and post-ﬁxed similarly to the samples prepared for
SEM. Fixed V. ﬁscheri cells were then serially dehydrated in a graded
ethanol series, inﬁltrated with propylene oxide, then embedded and
polymerized in LX112 epoxy resin for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were
stained with a saturated solution of lead citrate and uranyl acetate and
imaged with a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope coupled
to an AMT XR-41B 2k x 2k CCD camera.
Low-shear modeled microgravity conditions
To model the LSMMG environment, bacterial cultures were inoculated to a
ﬁnal concentration of 1 × 105 cells per mL of SWT and then loaded into
50-mL
capacity
HARVs
(Synthecon,
Houston,
TX),
as
previously
described21,27. HARVs were incubated at 23 °C and rotated at 13 rpm to
mimic spaceﬂight temperatures and to prevent sedimentation of the
cultures. Gravity controls were rotated around a vertical axis to control for
HARV-speciﬁc effects. To assess growth, the OD600 of the HARV cultures
were measured in triplicate every 2 h using a Synergy plate reader (BioTek,
Winooski, VT). To examine the effects of LSMMG on V. ﬁscheri size, cultures
from each HARV were collected at 12 h. Cells were stained with 1% crystal
violet and analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, using PROGRES
GRYPHAX Image Capture software for measurements of cell length (Carl
Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To monitor motility of the LSMMG- and gravity-
treated cells, aliquots were also examined with both direct light
microscopy video imaging using PROGRES GRYPHAX Image Capture
software and soft-agar motility assays as previously described85. All
experiments were performed at least three times and outliers identiﬁed via
the 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) method were removed prior to analysis87.
A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Signiﬁcance
was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test using a cut off
of p < 0.05.
LPS preparation, treatments, and quantiﬁcation
For the quantiﬁcation of V. ﬁscheri-derived LPS, cells were spun down by
centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was sterilized by successive
passage through 0.45- and 0.22-μm syringe ﬁlters. Reactionogenic LPS
within the cell-free ﬁltrates was then examined using the ToxinSensorTM
Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Endotoxin Assay Kit
(Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For all samples, the absorbance at 545 nm was used to calculate the
concentration of reactionogenic LPS in endotoxin units (EU) per mL, which
was subsequently normalized to the OD600 of the culture to account for
differences in growth between LSMMG and gravity conditions within the
HARVs. For all LAL assays, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 EU per mL standards
were run in triplicate.
In addition, total LPS was quantiﬁed using the colorimetric Purpald
assay41 with a Synergy plate reader (Biotek, Winsooki, VT). The Purpald
assay is based on the sequential periodate oxidation of LPS core-speciﬁc
sugar residues and the reaction of formaldehyde with Purpald Reagent
(4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4,triazole)
to
produce
a
purple-
colored end product41. For all samples, the absorbance at 550 nm was
used to calculate the concentration of total LPS in μg per mL, which was
normalized by OD600 to account for differences in growth. The test:control
ratio comparing total LPS from cultures grown in LSMMG versus normal
gravity conditions was then calculated. For all Purpald assays, 10, 25, 50,
100, 250, and 500 μg per mL LPS standards were run in triplicate. Outliers

identiﬁed via the 1.5× interquartile range (IQR) method were removed
prior to analysis and a Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality.
Signiﬁcance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test
using a cut off of p < 0.05.
Isolation and quantiﬁcation of OMVs from V. ﬁscheri ES114
To isolate OMVs, 1 L of V. ﬁscheri cultures were grown under LSMMG and
gravity conditions in the HARVs. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and
the resulting supernatant passed through 0.45 and 0.22-μm ﬁlters (Millipore
Sigma, Burlington, MA) to yield a puriﬁed, cell-free, ﬁltrate. On those OMV
samples exposed to host animals, the vesicles were pelleted by ultra-
centrifugation (TL-100, Beckman, Brea, CA) at 173,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C to
concentration the OMV particles. The pellet was then washed and
resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with
0.20 M NaCl to yield a crude OMV extract. The OMVs in this extract were
further separated from cellular debris by additional ultra-centrifugation at
90,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C through a discontinuous 25–55% w/v sucrose
density gradient. After, the fraction upward of 45% was collected and
washed twice with PBS by ultra-centrifugation at 173,000 × g for 4 h at 4 ˚C.
The ﬁnal OMV preparation was ﬁlter-sterilized through a 0.22-μm ﬁlter. OMV
yield was measured by protein assay using a Qubit 2.0 ﬂuorometer (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
All ﬁnal OMV preparations were stored at −80 °C until use.
The concentration and size distributions of OMVs produced under
LSMMG and gravity conditions were determined by nanoparticle tracking
analysis using a NanoSight NS300 instrument equipped with a 488 nm
laser (NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Cell-free ﬁltrates from wild-type and
motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h were diluted in PBS to achieve a
threshold of 10–100 particles per frame. Prior to analysis, background
values were subtracted from all measurements of concentration. All
measurements were taken at ambient temperature (22–24 °C), with the
settings for minimum expected particle size, shortest track length, and blur
left at the factory default. For each sample, a minimum of 40-s capture
videos was collected in triplicate, with the camera operating at the
standard 30 frames-per-second. Between samples, the NS300 system was
ﬂushed thrice with PBS and once with deionized water. Further analyses to
determine mean particle size, size distribution, and concentration were
performed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software suite (NTA;
version 3.2, NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Background particle concentra-
tion was assessed by diluting and analyzing sterile SWT. A Shapiro–Wilk
test was used to assess the normality of the nanoparticle concentration
data. The normality of the OMV size data—which contained over 10,000
measurements per condition—was determined with a Lillifors test88.
Signiﬁcance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test
using a cut off of p < 0.05.
General E. scolopes procedures and visualization of host
apoptotic cells
Squid experiments were conducted in triplicate and in accordance with
the University of Florida and Kennedy Space Center Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committees. After hatching, juvenile squid was rinsed twice
in 0.22 μm ﬁltered seawater (FSW) and treated with either exogenous LPS
from Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
or OMVs isolated from batch cultures of the wild-type V. ﬁscheri. A subset
of hatchlings was also rendered symbiotic by inoculation with the wild-
type V. ﬁscheri to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 × 105 cells per mL of FSW. After
16 h, the animals were anesthetized in a 1:1 solution of FSW and 0.37
MgCl2 for 5 min, containing 0.001% acridine orange dye. Light organ
apoptosis was then examined via epiﬂuorescence microscopy using a Zeiss
Axioplan Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Colonization was veriﬁed
for all treatments by measuring bacterial luminescence with a photometer
(GloMax 20/20 Luminometer, Promega Corp., Madison, WI).
Membrane integrity evaluation under gravity and LSMMG
conditions
To examine the effects of LSMMG on V. ﬁscheri cell wall integrity, growth
curves were conducted in triplicate in the presence of polymyxin B and SDS.
Samples were collected from each HARV, normalized, and exposed to a
solution containing either 1–10 μg polymyxin B or 0.1–1.0% SDS per mL of
SWT at 23 °C without shaking. After 24 h of exposure, the samples were
resuspended by pipetting and optical density was measured spectro-
photometrically (OD600) and signiﬁcance was determined via non-parametric
Mann–Whitney U test for all readings of optical density. To measure the
viability of cells treated with the polymyxin B or SDS a subset of cells was
then diluted and plated on SWT media. Signiﬁcance between treatments of
plate counts was assessed using a Welch’s t-test with a cut off of p > 0.05.
To further assess the integrity of the symbiont cell membrane under
LSMMG conditions, cultures were grown for 12 h at 23 °C and pelleted in
5 mL aliquots. The pellets were washed and resuspended in PBS and then
incubated in 0.05% v/v Triton X-100, a non-ionic detergent that disrupts
membrane lipids48 at 23 °C for 1 min. Immediately after, the absorbance
was read at 405 nm and the percentage of intact, undisrupted, cells was
calculated as the turbidity of the treatment group relative to the control.
This value was then subtracted from 100% to obtain the percent lysis. The
formula is as follows: Bacteriolysis (%) = (100% −((OD405 of treatment/
OD405 of control) × 100)). A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data
normality whereas signiﬁcance was determined via non-parametric
Mann–Whitney U test.
