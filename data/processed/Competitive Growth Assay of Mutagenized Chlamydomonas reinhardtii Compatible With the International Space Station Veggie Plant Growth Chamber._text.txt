A biological life support system for spaceﬂight would capture carbon dioxide waste
produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds.
Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to ﬁx carbon into organic molecules.
Microalgae are highly efﬁcient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into
biomass, particularly under limiting, artiﬁcial light conditions that are a necessity in
space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae
for chemical or food production in space, most spaceﬂight algae growth studies have
been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here
we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the
International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored
for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth
in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations
induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082)
or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing
identiﬁed UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-
synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes
with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing
genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases,
and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modiﬁcation of DNA repair, signal
transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this
spaceﬂight production system.

INTRODUCTION
Microalgae grow by converting light, water, and CO2 into
biomass. Algae have long been proposed for space life support
systems to recycle CO2 and provide food either directly or
indirectly to astronauts (Brechignac and Schiller, 1992; Ai et al.,
2008; Niederwieser et al., 2018; Matula and Nabity, 2019). Many
species of microalgae are photosynthetically eﬃcient under the
limiting light and low volume conditions necessary in space
production (Kliphuis et al., 2012). As single cell organisms,
microalgae are easy to cultivate with minimal requirements, and
have great potential to yield value-added products.
Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, such as Chlorella
vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis, respectively, are generally
regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption (Caporgno
and Mathys, 2018). Algae have nutritional beneﬁts with high
levels of antioxidants and protein with essential amino acids
(Buono et al., 2014). Algae are also rich in ω-3 fatty acids,
such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (Salem
and Eggersdorfer, 2015). The red algal carotenoid, astaxanthin,
has multiple uses including the ability to protect against retinal
damage in animals (Wang et al., 2000; Katagiri et al., 2012; Liu
et al., 2016; Otsuka et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2016). Algal oils
may be used in future astronaut diets to help mitigate harmful
eﬀects of microgravity and cosmic radiation during spaceﬂight.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model organism for unicellular
algae with a well-annotated genome sequence (Merchant et al.,
2007). Although Chlamydomonas is not designated as a GRAS
organism, feeding studies show no harmful eﬀects of including
signiﬁcant amounts of algae biomass in animal feed (Baek et al.,
2018; Murbach et al., 2018). Consequently, Chlamydomonas can
be used as a model for other microalgae species, an animal feed
for space food systems, or a feedstock for manufacturing.
A few past studies exposed or grew algal species in space
conditions (Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989; Wang et al.,
2006; Giardi et al., 2013; Niederwieser et al., 2018). A Space
Shuttle mission in 1985 used C. reinhardtii to examine phototaxic
responses in microgravity (Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen,
1989). Microgravity allowed cells to remain close to light sources
in spaceﬂight suggesting that photosynthetic productivity could
be higher in space. By contrast, Wang et al. (2006) grew
cyanobacteria for 15 days in a satellite and found reduced
growth relative to a ground control. However, the ground
control temperature and light cycles were not adjusted to the
space conditions. The satellite had two temperature drops and
two missed day photoperiods preventing strong conclusions
from being drawn about growth rates. Giardi et al. (2013)
compared Chlamydomonas photosynthetic responses for wild-
type and photosystem II (PSII) D1 mutants in stationary cultures.
Spaceﬂight had a greater negative eﬀect on PSII ﬂuorescence in
wild-type cells and negatively impacted cell growth upon return
to Earth. Soviet and Russian spaceﬂight experiments indicate
that C. vulgaris has similar growth kinetics in space and on
Earth, but the cells experience spaceﬂight as a stress (reviewed
in Niederwieser et al., 2018).
The impact of the spaceﬂight environment for larger scale
production of algae is currently unknown. To test larger scale
microalgae production, the European Space Agency (ESA)
has developed a photobioreactor that pumps liquid media
through a meandering path, pipe-reactor (Bretschneider et al.,
2016). Gas exchange is mediated by ﬂuorinated ethylene
propylene (FEP) membranes that allow CO2 and O2 diﬀusion,
while algae are continuously mixed with a peristaltic pump
(Helisch et al., 2019). This photobioreactor is currently being
tested on the International Space Station (ISS) for long-term
growth of C. vulgaris. A signiﬁcant challenge of maintaining
photosynthetic productivity is regular removal of stationary
cells and addition of new media to maintain photoautotrophic
growth without forming excessive bioﬁlms within the raceway.
In addition, this photobioreactor experiment is not focusing
on understanding genes required for growth in spaceﬂight
conditions (Helisch et al., 2019).
In yeast, competitive growth experiments in liquid culture
were used to identify genes needed for survival in spaceﬂight
conditions (Nislow et al., 2015). We are completing spaceﬂight
experiments to determine similar gene sets for Chlamydomonas
via competitive growth of mutagenized cells. Here we report
results from our development of methods and experiment
veriﬁcation test (EVT). We describe a simple batch culture
protocol using commercial FEP tissue culture bags that is adapted
to the Veggie plant growth chambers on the ISS. Shortwave
ultraviolet (UVC) light mutagenesis and full genome sequencing
enabled the detection of new mutations in two microalgae
strains. The spectrum of mutations identiﬁed suggests that UVC
primarily induces DNA damage in Chlamydomonas via errors
in translesion synthesis and double strand break repair. In
addition, a variety of cellular information processing functions
may need to be modiﬁed to adapt Chlamydomonas to this
batch culture system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and Culturing Conditions
Strains CC-5082 (WT) and CC-1883 (cw15) were obtained from
the Chlamydomonas Resource Center. CC-5082 is a sequence-
veriﬁed clone of CC-1690, which is a wild-type strain of mating
type mt+ (Gallaher et al., 2015). CC-1883 is an mt−cw15 cell
wall mutant, which allows transformation of exogenous DNA by
vortexing with cells and glass beads (Kindle et al., 1989). Strains
were maintained at room temperature (20–25◦C) on agar plates
with Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (Gorman and Levine,
1965), under 50–100 µmol/m2/s continuous photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR) from daylight ﬂuorescent bulbs (6500 K).
To initiate liquid cultures, 1–2 mm colonies were scraped
from TAP agar plate and inoculated into 50–100 mL TAP
media. Traditional liquid cultures were grown with continuous
light in 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks with 100 r/min gyratory
shaking. For spaceﬂight analogs, liquid cultures were grown with
continuous light in 120 mL PermaLife cell culture bags (OriGen
Biomedical, Austin, TX, United States). Liquid cultures were
grown in daylight ﬂuorescent lighting or in the Veggie Vegetable
Production System at the Kennedy Space Center (Merritt Island,
FL, United States) with a ratio of red (630 nm): green (525 nm):

blue (450 nm) of 8:1:1 (Massa et al., 2016). The Veggie reservoir
was set at the maximum distance from the LED lightcap. All
lighting was 80–100 µmol/m2/s.
The UVC mutagenesis dose that caused ∼10% cell survival
was determined by transferring 7 mL of early-log phase culture
at OD600 = 0.45 to 15 cm sterile petri plates in a sterile laminar
ﬂow hood. The petri plates were opened in a GS Gene Linker UV
Chamber (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and exposed to
increasing doses of UVC light from germicidal bulbs. Petri plates
were closed, wrapped in aluminum foil, and agitated overnight
in the dark at 50 r/min. Mutagenized cultures were plated on
TAP agar plates with non-treated samples diluted 1:5 prior to
plating. Colonies were grown under continuous light, counted,
and normalized relative to non-mutagenized cultures.
EVT Mutagenesis
Colonies from TAP agar plates were scraped and suspended in
600 µL liquid TAP media and adjusted to an optical density of 1 at
600 nm using a visible light spectrophotometer (SmartSpec 3000,
Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). The Chlamydomonas
suspension was used to inoculate TAP liquid media at a 1:250
dilution, i.e., 0.2 mL of OD600 = 1 suspension was added to 50 mL
TAP media. WT was inoculated on day 1 of the experiment and
cw15 was inoculated on day 2. The cultures were grown in ﬂasks
until reaching an OD600 of 0.4–0.5 on day 4. Non-mutagenized
cells from the culture were sampled for whole genome sequencing
by centrifuging 2 mL of the culture and freezing the cell pellet
at −80◦C until DNA was extracted. For each mutagenesis, 7 mL
of early-log phase culture was exposed to 8 mJ of UV light.
The mutagenized cells were then used to inoculate 100 mL of
TAP media in a PermaLife tissue culture bag in a sterile laminar
ﬂow hood. Inoculated tissue culture bags were held at room
temperature in the dark for 7 days and then transferred to the
Veggie growth chamber.
EVT Culture Conditions and Selection
The Veggie chamber was set with the reservoir at maximum
distance from the lighting (Massa et al., 2016). The 630 nm red
light was set to “medium”; the 450 nm blue light was set to “low”;
and the 525 nm green light was set to “on.” The bellows were
closed during growth cycles, and the fan was set to “low.” The
initial mutagenized cultures were grown for 7 days in Veggie.
The cultures were then passaged by transferring 1 mL of culture
to a bag containing fresh TAP media using a sterile syringe. The
second culture was grown for 6 days and then passaged to a third
tissue culture bag for 6 days of growth. During each passage, 2 mL
of culture was sampled, centrifuged, and the cell pellet was frozen
at −80◦C until DNA was extracted. The remaining cultures were
stored in a soft stowage, Cargo Transport Bag (CTB) until 36 days
after the initial inoculation. For each dark-stored culture, 2 mL
was sampled for DNA extraction.
Growth Assays
Growth curves for non-mutagenized cells were determined by
sampling 1 mL of culture each day and reading the absorbance
at 600 and 750 nm. Culture samples were diluted if optical
density measurements were greater than 1. Cell density was
counted using a hemocytometer and light microscopy. Dry
biomass was determined by transferring all of the remaining
culture volume into two 50 mL centrifuge tubes. The cells were
centrifuged with the supernatant media removed and the cell
pellets were lyophilized overnight. Dry weights were measured
on an analytical balance. Biomass for each culture is the average
of the two technical replicates.
Whole Genome Sequencing
DNA was extracted from the ﬂash-frozen and dark-stored cell
pellets as described with some minor modiﬁcations (Newman
et al., 1990). Cell pellets were resuspended in 150 µL H2O on
ice, and 300 µL of SDS-EB buﬀer (2% SDS, 400 mM NaCl,
40 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was added and
vortexed. The cell suspension was then extracted with 350 µL
phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1 (v:v) for 2–5 min
by intermittent mixing using a vortex. The organic and aqueous
phases were separated with a 5 min centrifugation at maximum
speed in a microcentrifuge. The aqueous phase was then extracted
with 300 µL chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The RNA in the
aqueous phase was digested with RNase A at room temperature
for 10 min. DNA was precipitated by adding 1 mL 100% ethanol,
incubating on ice for 30 min, and centrifuging for 10 min.
The pellet was washed with 200 µL 70% ethanol, dried in a
vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 30 µL H2O. DNA sample
integrity was evaluated with an Agilent TapeStation (Santa Clara,
CA, United States), and concentration was determined with
Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For each library, 3 µg of DNA was sheared to 350 bp
average size using an S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris,
Woburn, MA, United States). Barcoded TruSeq PCR-Free Low
Throughput libraries were prepared for each DNA sample
following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego,
CA, United States). Each sample had a unique index from
Illumina TruSeq DNA CD Indexes (96 indexes/samples). The
libraries were split into two pools to sequence a total of 38
samples: nine dark-stored and nine ﬂash-frozen samples for
each strain, growth cycle, and biological replicate as well as
the two non-mutagenized initial cultures. Library pools were
color-balanced and sequenced with paired-end 150 bp reads on
the Illumina HiSeq X platform at MedGenome (Foster City,
CA, United States).
Read Processing and Genome Alignment
The raw sequence reads were ﬁltered using Trimmomatic
v.0.38 to remove barcode and adaptor sequences in paired-
end mode (Bolger et al., 2014). High quality reads were
aligned to the C. reinhardtii reference genome (Merchant et al.,
2007), v.5.6 from Phytozome, using BWA-mem (Li, 2013).
Duplicate reads were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates,
v.2.19.11 with default parameters. Reads near insertion-deletion
(InDel) polymorphisms were realigned using GATK v.3.8.1
RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner (McKenna et al.,
2010; DePristo et al., 2011).

Identifying Sequence Variants
Three
software
packages
for
detecting
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels were compared.
FreeBayes v.1.2.0 (Garrison and Marth, 2012) was implemented
with the pooled continuous option. LoFreq v. 2.1.3.1 used default
parameters (Wilm et al., 2012), while CRISP pooled, discrete
parameters were: –poolsize 5 –perms 100000 –mmq 10 –minc
3 (Bansal, 2010; Bansal et al., 2011). FreeBayes called more
variants for libraries with the lowest depth giving a negative
correlation between the number of mapped reads and number
of variants detected. LoFreq is restricted to calling variants
for single samples and not detecting variants at a population
level. Consequently, CRISP was determined to be the optimal
approach for variant detection.
For each strain, CRISP genotyping results were ﬁltered to
remove variants with a call rate below 70% (i.e., missing
data ≥30%) and monomorphic variants with a minor allele
frequency (MAF) of zero. Monomorphic variants revealed non-
mutated, natural variants relative to the reference genome. In
addition, variants with low depth and low-quality mapped reads
were removed based on CRISP assignments of “LowDepth,
LowMQ10 and LowMQ20.” Finally, novel variants were scored
by identifying exact matches to natural variants reported from
whole genome sequencing of 39 Chlamydomonas laboratory
strains (Gallaher et al., 2015). Variant density was visualized by
plotting SNPs detected in windows of 100, 400, 500, and 1000 kb.
A window size of 400 kb was selected visually as showing the
highest resolution of natural variant SNP clusters.
Determining Protein Coding Variants and
Selection
The eﬀect of each variant on protein coding regions was predicted
using SnpEﬀv.4.3t (Cingolani et al., 2012). Synonymous and
non-synonymous mutations from the primary SnpEﬀcall were
used to estimate the overall impact of UVC mutagenesis on
protein coding genes. Synonymous (πS) and non-synonymous
(πN) nucleotide diversity was estimated for each gene using
SNPGenie (Nelson et al., 2015). SNPGenie was run for all high-
quality and novel variants independently, using both the forward
strand and reverse complement strand. Positive selection was
inferred when πN > πS, and purifying selection was inferred
when πN < πS. Genes showing positive or purifying selection
were tested for gene ontology (GO) term enrichment using
AgriGO v2.0 with default parameters except for the “Hochberg
(FDR)” multi-test adjustment method for the default false
discovery rate of 0.05 (Tian et al., 2017).
RESULTS
We tested commercial FEP tissue culture bags for the ability to
support microalgae growth without agitation or active mixing of
gases with liquids. Under daylight ﬂuorescent lighting, the bags
are able to support robust growth for both cw15 and WT strains
(Figures 1A–D). Time courses of growth show a 1 day delay in
the bags (Figures 1E–H). Logistic growth curve regressions of
optical density estimated the maximum doubling time for cw15
was 5.32 h in ﬂasks and 8.01 h in FEP bags (Figure 1E). For WT,
maximal doubling time was 7.42 h for ﬂasks and 8.98 h for FEP
bags (Figure 1F). Similar doubling times were estimated from
cell counts: 5.7 versus 7.65 h for cw15 and 7.3 versus 8.73 h for
WT (Figures 1G,H). Cell counts estimated a 600- to 1450-fold
increase in cell number during the culture indicating 9–11 cell
doublings in the batch cultures. Dry weight biomass was in rank
order with the measurements of optical density and cell density
at the 6 days time point. The cw15 ﬂask cultures had the lowest
biomass at 0.61 g/L, and the WT ﬂask cultures had the highest
biomass at 0.95 g/L (Figure 1I). The FEP tissue culture bags
grew to a cell density in-between ﬂask cultures for cw15 and WT.
These data indicate the bags provide suﬃcient gas exchange to
support microalgae, but that Chlamydomonas laboratory strains
grow faster in ﬂasks.
To identify genes required for growth in tissue culture bags,
we mutagenized the strains prior to competitive growth assays.
We ﬁrst determined the dose-response for cell lethality in a
UVC light chamber. Figure 1J shows that 6–10 mJ of UVC
exposure is suﬃcient to kill ∼90% of WT cells. Similar results
were obtained for cw15, and we concluded that 8 mJ of UVC
would give suﬃcient DNA damage to induce mutations in both
strains without risking excessive cell death and culture failure
during spaceﬂight.
An EVT was completed at the Kennedy Space Center
(Figure 2). Three biological replicates of WT and cw15 were
mutagenized at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL,
United States. The mutagenized cells were transferred to tissue
culture bags with TAP media and stored at room temperature in
the dark for 7 days to emulate a late load and storage during a
resupply mission to the ISS. The cultures were then transferred
to a Veggie unit to provide light and stimulate photosynthesis.
The culture bags were placed under bungee cords that hold
plant pillows in the Veggie reservoir (Figure 2B). The bags were
left without any agitation except during passages (Figure 2C).
To complete a passage, culture bags were removed from the
reservoir, agitated manually, and 1 mL of culture was transferred
to fresh media for a new growth cycle (Figures 2D–F). An
additional 2 mL of culture was sampled and cell pellets were
frozen to preserve a DNA sample without dark storage.
The remaining culture was stored in a closed CTB to simulate
ambient storage on the ISS and return of live cultures to Earth
(Figure 3A). At 36 days after the initial inoculation, all culture
bags were sampled for DNA extraction and biomass assessment
(Figure 3B). The WT strain showed higher biomass compared
to the cw15 cell wall mutant (p = 0.01, paired Student’s t-test).
Within each strain, there was a signiﬁcant trend for increased
biomass with additional culture passages (p < 0.01, ANOVA).
However, all biomass levels were lower than immediate harvest
of cells after 6 days of culture without UV mutagenesis or dark
storage (Figure 1I). The biomass trends observed most likely
reﬂect loss of biomass due to respiration during dark storage.
Whole genome sequencing of the pre-mutagenized cultures,
frozen cell pellets, and dark stored cultures was completed
with an average read depth of 16x. Variants consisting of SNPs
and short InDel polymorphisms were called with CRISP using
pooled sample parameters (Figure 4). After removing missing

detected 73,573 WT variants and 79,455 cw15 variants. Filtering
to remove low-depth and low-quality reads reduced WT and

(Figure 5, Gallaher et al., 2015). The WT strain is a sequence-
veriﬁed clone of CC-1690, and the polymorphic variants
identiﬁed overlapping peaks on chromosomes 2, 6, and 9.
In addition, there were peaks that overlapped with other
natural variants on chromosomes 3 and 12. The cw15 strain
derives from a cross with CC-1690 and a similar pattern of
natural variant peaks was observed. These natural variants may
represent spontaneous mutations that are easily tolerated in
Chlamydomonas or regions of the genome that are diﬃcult to
align with high conﬁdence. In either case, known natural variants
are likely to have little signal of selection due to induced UVC
mutagenesis. We removed all exact matches to natural variants to
obtain 5286 WT and 5873 cw15 novel variants, which are more
evenly distributed across the genome (Figure 5). The average
genomic density for the novel variants were one variant per
20.83 kbp in WT and 18.75 kbp in cw15.
The novel variants show a diﬀerent spectrum of base
changes than natural variants (Figure 6A). There is a relative
decrease in transitions and an increase in transversions with
the complementary mutations of A > C and T > G as well as
C > G and G > C predominating. These data suggest the novel
variants represent mutations caused by induced mutagenesis
instead of the endogenous spectrum of Chlamydomonas variants.
In addition, the novel mutations are found at a higher allele
frequency indicating that the novel mutations have more
sequence read support across samples than natural variants
(Figure 6B). We conclude that novel variants better represent the
UVC mutagenized sites.
Centrifugation and freezing cell pellets for DNA sampling
requires more extensive astronaut time and limiting resources
on the ISS. We compared the mutations recovered from samples
that had been frozen at the time of passage and those from
live cultures that had been stored in the dark. There were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in sequencing depth based on the storage
conditions (Figures 6C,D). However, dark storage decreased
the number of mutations recovered in passage 1, which were
cultures stored for 22 days prior to sampling (Figures 6E,F).
Student’s t-tests showed a signiﬁcant reduction of mutations
detected for the WT strain (p = 0.003), but the reduction was
non-signiﬁcant for cw15 (p = 0.07). For frozen stored libraries, the
number of novel mutations detected in each passage was nearly
constant indicating sequencing depth was limiting for mutant
detection. These results suggest that changes in allele frequency
over culture passages are not a reliable indicator of selection for
this experiment.
To assess the eﬀects of novel mutation on protein coding
sequences, SnpEﬀwas used to identify protein coding changes.
Natural variants were enriched for synonymous mutations, while
the novel variants were enriched for protein coding changes
(Figure 7A). These results are consistent with an increased
frequency of deleterious mutations after UV mutagenesis.
Individual genes were tested for selection based on nucleotide

genes showing evidence of positive selection with about 46% of
genes tested having πN > πS, compared to 29% of all variants
(Figure 7B). These results are consistent with the enrichment for
non-synonymous mutations resulting from UV mutagenesis.
Based on GO term enrichment analyses, the positively selected
genes in WT and cw15 both show signiﬁcant enrichments for
terms associated with purine nucleotide binding and hydrolase
activity (Figure 7C). The individual genes with these GO
terms represent information processing functions in DNA
damage repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors,
and signal transduction (Supplementary Table S1). The WT
libraries also had enrichment for terms associated with small
molecule transporters with individual genes predominantly being
ABC transporters.
The WT strain also had signiﬁcant enrichments for genes
under purifying selection (Figure 8). More than half of these
genes are predicted to function in regulating the levels of cyclic
nucleotide second messengers suggesting that second messenger
signal transduction may be under selective pressure in in the
culture bag growth system. The cw15 strain had no signiﬁcantly-
enriched GO terms for genes under purifying selection.
DISCUSSION
This EVT validated a strategy for identifying genes required
by Chlamydomonas during log phase growth in spaceﬂight.
We have shown that commercial FEP tissue culture bags
can be used for batch culture of microalgae and result in
9–11 cell doublings during a 6 day culture. Cells in these
cultures that divide normally will be at least 1000 fold
enriched at stationary phase over cells with genetic variants
that prevent mitotic division. Competition through multiple

passages will eliminate mutations that prevent mitotic growth.
Chlamydomonas is viable in these bags after prolonged dark
storage, which enables full genome sequencing and identiﬁcation
of mutant genes in the culture. We have since used this
strategy to grow the WT and cw15 strains during the
SpaceX CRS-15 mission; analysis of the spaceﬂight experiment
is on-going.
Whole genome sequencing has been used to assess the
mutagenic load of the bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, in a
2 week spaceﬂight exposure (Guo et al., 2015). Less than
40 SNPs were detected in the genome from spaceﬂight with
similar numbers of SNPs detected on ground and in spaceﬂight.
These data suggest that exogenous mutagenesis is necessary
to gain adequate signal of selection in short-term competitive
growth experiments.
A yeast selection experiment was completed in spaceﬂight by
using a genome-wide deletion collection (Nislow et al., 2015).
The competitive growth experiment measured the reduction
in representation of bar-coded mutants over the course of
∼21 mitotic generations. This type of competitive growth
identiﬁes individual genes needed for growth. By contrast, UVC
mutagenesis has a higher genetic load and generates a more
diverse array of allele types to compete within the culture.
Moreover, three serial batch cultures of Chlamydomonas are
expected to give ∼30 mitotic generations potentially giving more
signal of selection within the genome sequence data.
There are several limitations to the design of this competitive
growth assay. The algae were grown in mixotrophic conditions
with both acetate and light as sources of energy. The addition
of acetate to the media promotes rapid growth of the cultures
allowing up to four passages to be completed in a 1-month
SpaceX commercial resupply mission. Consequently, genes
under purifying selection are expected to include pathways to
utilize acetate. Similarly, the Veggie growth chamber has a
limited spectrum of lighting with three narrow wavelengths
that do not include far-red light (Massa et al., 2016). Each
wavelength has two to four light level settings, and the
lighting needed to be enriched for red light to provide 80–
100 µmol/m2/s of light to the culture bags. Limitations to
random mutagenesis are that loss-of-function mutations in all
genes are not represented in each biological replicate of the
experiment and that multiple mutations are simultaneously
selected in individual cells during mitotic divisions. Moreover,
we found that all cultures had a high level of polymorphisms

that were identical to previously described natural variants in
laboratory strains (Gallaher et al., 2015). The sequencing depth
and 30 mitotic generations of the experiment did not provide
suﬃcient sensitivity to detect changes in allele frequencies
of individual natural variants. Consequently, we focused on
selection signatures in novel mutations that were unique to UV
mutagenized cultures.
Ultraviolet light causes direct DNA damage to create
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and the UV mutation signature
is typically biased toward C > T transitions (Ikehata and
Ono, 2011). Chlamydomonas DNA readily forms pyrimidine
dimers, and WT strains have a robust dark-repair pathway
to repair 90–95% of the DNA damage directly within 24 h
(Small, 1987). With whole genome sequencing, we observed
enrichment for T > G and C > G transversions in the mutations
resulting from the UV treatment instead of the expected
C > T transitions. Incorporation of several oxidative products
of guanine can promote C > G transversions in response to a
variety of mutagens, including UV (Kino and Sugiyama, 2005).
In human cancers, C > G base changes are associated
with activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases followed
by error-prone translesion synthesis (Forbes et al., 2017).
Human cancers also have base substitution signatures that
are enriched
for T > G, such as
COSMIC signatures
17b and 28 (Forbes et al., 2017). However, no speciﬁc
mechanisms have been proposed for the speciﬁc enrichment of
T > G transversions.
Intriguingly, we observed signatures of selection in DNA

which are associated with translesion synthesis (Sakamoto,
2019). In the human germ line, C > G mutations have
been suggested to be caused by errors in double-stand

evidence of selection for both of these enzymes in the

double-strand break repair and translesion synthesis suggests
that these pathways are likely relevant to the UV-induced
mutations observed.

The low sequence coverage of this experiment creates risk
in using the frequency of recovery for speciﬁc mutant alleles
in determining whether speciﬁc genes are under positive or
purifying selection. The number of alleles discovered is limited
by the sequencing depth, and higher coverage is necessary to
increase the power of the statistics to detect selection at a
genome-wide level. Nevertheless, we were able to classify 476
genes in the WT strain and 503 genes in the cw15 strain
for purifying or positive selection based on mutations within
coding sequences. Among these, 104 genes were enriched for
molecular functions based on GO terms. In addition to DNA
repair pathways, these analyses revealed signal transduction and
other information processing functions including, chromatin
reading, RNA processing, and translation to be enriched within
selected genes. The enriched molecular functions are predicted
to be processes necessary for Chlamydomonas to adapt to
the UV mutagenesis, lack of media agitation, the diﬀusion of
gases across the FEP membrane, and the lighting conditions in
the Veggie unit.
Scalable production of Chlamydomonas in spaceﬂight has
multiple potential applications. The species will accumulate lipids
to about 20–25% of total biomass, which can be used as an
organic chemical feedstock (Becker, 2007; Xu et al., 2018).
Chlamydomonas also has high protein content of 40–60% of
biomass making it a potential source of food. Although it is not
yet designated as a GRAS organism by the FDA, Chlamydomonas
is non-toxic; animal feeding studies show no harmful eﬀects
at 4 g algae biomass per kg body weight per day, the highest
consumption levels tested (Murbach et al., 2018). Equivalent
consumption for a 65 kg person would be approximately 260 g
of algae powder per day.
As a genetic model organism, Chlamydomonas biomass
composition can be further modiﬁed by mutagenesis or targeted
gene editing. For example, starch over-accumulation mutants
have been isolated that shift starch content from 15 to 30–35%
of biomass (Koo et al., 2017). Likewise, CRISPR gene editing
of the Chlamydomonas zeaxanthin epoxidase gene signiﬁcantly
increases carotenoids needed to prevent macular degeneration
(Baek et al., 2018). The modiﬁed algae strain was used to
supplement chicken feed to increase the zeaxanthin content
of eggs. The myriad of potential applications for microalgae
production in spaceﬂight justify direct investigation of the genes
needed for liquid culture production. Our current study shows
both feasibility for a spaceﬂight experiment and identiﬁes a
series of cellular information processing genes that are likely
required for Chlamydomonas to adapt to batch culture in
breathable plastic bags.
