We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on
the structure of both micro þ nano phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric
populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich pico-
cyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and
bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure.
Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two con-
trasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a ¼ 7.6 μgL-1, turbidity ¼ 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlo-
rophyll a ¼ 25.0 μgL-1, turbidity ¼ 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer
ﬂasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control ¼ no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20,
200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L1. The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system,
total abundance of living (live) micro þ nano phytoplankton showed a signiﬁcant increase at lower concentra-
tions and data were ﬁtted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro þ nano
phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results
suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp.,
showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in
abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus
suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro þ nano plankton. Our
results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies
to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be
taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm
experiment.
1. Introduction
With the advent of genetically modiﬁed crops and the introduction of
no-till methods, herbicides have become the “stars” of the chemicals used
in industrial agriculture. Currently, glyphosate-based herbicides, whose
main mode of action is through the disruption of aromatic amino acid
biosynthesis (Amrhein et al., 1980), are used worldwide, while other
herbicides are applied as complementary tools for weed control. Herbi-
cides have several different modes of action (Peterson et al., 2015).
Auxinic herbicides, which belong to a chemical family largely used in
agriculture, mimic the biphasic effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA),
which is the principal natural auxin in higher plants. It usually stimulates
growth by cell division and elongation when targeted to cell sites of ac-
tion at low concentration (Grossmann, 2010). Auxin-derived herbicides

such as phenoxy hormone products were used in an average of 22,916
tons worldwide between 1990-2002. The use of these herbicides was
reported to increase an average of 30,436 tons of active ingredients be-
tween 2003-2014 (FAOSTAT, 2018). After more than 2 decades of
glyphosate massive spraying in Argentina, the use of herbicides such as 2,
4-D, paraquat and dicamba has sky-rocketed in the last years to prevent
the spread of glyphosate resistance in target weeds. The 2,4-D was the
third most imported herbicide into Argentina between 2013 and 2015
(SENASA, 2018), and now it is considered one of the most used agro-
chemicals worldwide (Singh and Singh, 2016). Moreover, plants genet-
ically modiﬁed to tolerate different herbicides, including 2,4-D, were
recently approved for commercial production in Argentina (CONABIA,
2019). Under this scenario, 2,4-D application rates are expected to in-
crease in Argentina.
The 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is an auxin-type selective
herbicide that induces overgrowth of vascular cambium in dicotyle-
donous, ultimately leading to death (Song, 2014). After application, it is
transformed by bacterial metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic
acid cycle (Singh and Singh, 2016). The persistence of 2,4-D in the
environment depends on the availability of other carbon sources
involved in microbial metabolism, its half-life being between 20 and 312
days (Islam et al., 2018).
Build-up of 2,4-D residues may cause important alterations in soil and
aquatic ecosystems. The 2,4-D can produce disruptive effects in fungi
(Bernat et al., 2018), insects (Sharma et al., 2018), amphibians (LaCha-
pelle et al., 2007; Aronzon et al., 2011; Van Meter et al., 2018), ﬁsh
(Dehnert et al., 2018; De Arcaute et al., 2018), and others (Islam et a.
2018). Other studies reported the effect of pure 2,4-D on microbial
communities (Kobraei and White, 1996; Aguayo et al., 2014; Lozano
et al., 2018), but little is known about the collateral impact of commercial
formulations of this herbicide on wild biota in agricultural landscapes.
These commercial formulations consist of the active ingredient (2,4-D),
water and inert elements such as solvents, surfactants and humectants of
unknown composition which increase plant cuticle permeability to 2,4-D
(Lanct^ot et al., 2014).
The 2,4-D has different effects according to its concentration: low
concentrations stimulate the growth of some phytoplanktonic species,
whereas high concentrations inhibit their development (Boyle, 1980;
Kobraei and White, 1996; Wong, 2000). In regard to other freshwater
communities, De Lipthay et al. (2003) reported that low concentrations
of the active ingredient (a.i.) (<40 μg L1) modify the structure of the
bacterial community from a shallow aquifer, leading to an increase in 2,
4-D degrading bacteria. In addition, an increase in Actinobacteria growth
was detected at 20 mg L1 of 2,4-D in an oligotrophic lake (Aguayo et al.,
2014), which resulted from the ability of Arthrobacter sp. to use 2,4-D and
other aromatic compounds as sources of carbon and energy (Sandmann
and Loos, 1988; Westerberg et al., 2000).
It is well known that freshwater systems become contaminated either
by direct spraying over water or indirectly via soil drift (Ensminger et al.,
2013; Aparicio et al., 2015; Berman et al., 2018; Metcalfe et al., 2019).
Algae and cyanobacteria from lakes, ponds and rivers share several
metabolic pathways with vascular plants, suggesting that they can be
similarly affected by herbicides (Ferrari et al., 2018). Indeed, these or-
ganisms have shown to be severely altered, mainly at the population level
(Vera et al., 2010, 2012; Lipok et al., 2010; Perez et al., 2011; Qiu et al.,
2013; Pizarro et al., 2016). They are important in freshwater ecosystems
because of their role as main primary producers, either as free-living
planktonic organisms or attached to diverse substrata (phyto-per-
iphyton fraction). Taking into account the important ecosystem services
supplied by freshwater systems, there is increasing concern about the
deleterious effect of herbicides, as previously demonstrated for glypho-
sate (Perez et al., 2007).
There are more than 10,000 shallow lakes in the Pampa plain of
Argentina (Dukatz et al., 2006), which is one of the most affected regions
by agricultural activities worldwide. These water bodies switch between
two alternative stable states with contrasting typologies (Scheffer et al.,
1993): clear-water lakes with very low phytoplankton abundance and
turbid ones dominated by phytoplankton. Both states show different
phytoplankton populations, as they are adapted to distinct nutrient and
light conditions (Allende et al., 2009). In last decades, however, there are
some evidences indicating that lakes remain turbid due to agrochemical
contamination (Quiros et al., 2002; Vera et al., 2010).
In this work we evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial
formulation of 2,4-D, on the structure of freshwater microbial commu-
nities under different exposure conditions using microcosms. The assays
were carried out with two different consolidated microbial assemblages.
One of these was sampled from a clear freshwater system and the other
from a turbid freshwater system. We analyzed the quali- and quantitative
composition of micro þ nano phytoplankton (>2 μm) and photosynthetic
picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which includes prokaryotic phycocyanin-
rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria
(PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk). Bacterioplankton (HB,
heterotrophic bacteria) was also considered in the analysis}. All the
microbial communities were exposed to a wide range of concentrations
of the active ingredient for 7 d. We tested the following hypotheses: 1-
the impact of AsiMax 50® depends on water turbidity, which results from
the different structure of the microbial communities; and 2- the impact of
AsiMax 50® depends on the 2,4-D concentration used.
2. Methods
We performed a manipulative laboratory experiment with 48 mi-
crocosms, each of which consisted of a 500-mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask ﬁlled
with water (experimental unit ¼ e.u.), taken from two outdoor water
systems of contrasting turbidity status. Of these, 24 were ﬁlled with clear
water (thereafter referred to as clear) and 24 with organic turbid water
(thereafter referred to as turbid). The initial conditions of water samples
were: chlorophyll a ¼ 7.6 μg L1, turbidity ¼ 1 NTU for clear and chlo-
rophyll a ¼ 25.0 μg L1, turbidity ¼ 9 NTU for turbid. These environ-
mental variables are usually used to characterize the shallow lakes
typical of the Pampa plain from Argentina (Allende et al., 2009). Mi-
crocosms were randomly placed in a shaking chamber set at 25 C and
12:12 L:D photoperiod during the entire exposure to AsiMax 50®. After a
microcosm stabilization period of 3 days, the experiment started with the
addition of 2,4-D as commercial formulation of AsiMax 50®, randomly
applied in triplicate, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient
(a.i.): 0 (control ¼ no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.
L1 to clear and turbid microcosms. The sampling scheme was as follows:
a) samples were taken from 3 e.u. at zero time (T0, before addition of
AsiMax 50®) to determine the initial conditions of physical and chemical
parameters and micro þ nanophytoplankton; b) samples were taken from
all treatments after 7d (Tf, ﬁnal time) to determine treatment effect; c)
considering the time scale at which populations of very small organisms
react to an impact (Peck, 2011), samples of PPP and HB were taken after
15 min (T1) and 7 d (Tf) of 2,4-D addition (n ¼ 24 for both groups).
2.1. Physical and chemical parameters
The real concentrations of 2,4-D were measured from water samples
collected from all the e.u. and kept at -20 C for further processing. For
2,4-D determination, samples were unfrozen, homogenized and diluted
1:10 with Milli-Q water. Finally, the samples were collected in 2-mL glass
vials and the analysis was performed using HPLC-UV technique coupled
with UV detector at 232 nm (APHA, 2005). Turbidity was measured with
a portable turbidimeter (Hach® 2100 P).
2.2. Biological variables
2.2.1. Chlorophyll a concentration
For chlorophyll a determination, 200-mL water samples were ﬁltered
through Whatman® GF/F ﬁlters and stored at -20 C. Chlorophyll a
concentration values were obtained by spectrophotometric absorbance,

using acetone as solvent. Absorbances were read at 665 and 750 nm,
before and after acidiﬁcation with HCl 1 N. Before reading, samples were
ﬁrst left overnight in the solvent and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm.
Concentration values were obtained following Lilchtenthaler and Well-
burn (1983).
2.2.2. Micro and nano-phytoplankton (2–200 μm)
A 200-mL water sample from each e.u. was ﬁxed with acidiﬁed
Lugol's iodine solution and kept at 4 C for subsequent phytoplankton (˃2
μm) counts. These were made according to Uterm€ohl's technique
(Uterm€ohl, 1958) to the lowest taxonomic level, distinguishing between
live and dead organisms. Individuals were considered to be alive when
they had an organized cell structure with undamaged chloroplasts and
cell wall (e.g. frustules for diatoms), among other structures.
A maximum counting error of 20% was accepted for the most abun-
dant taxa (Venrick, 1978).
2.2.3. PPP and HB populations (<2 μm)
Picoplankton, which comprised different PPP populations, and HB
were analyzed using a FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson®) ﬂow cytometer
equipped with a standard 15 mW blue argon-ion (488 nm emission) laser
and a red laser diode (635 nm). Samples (3.6 mL) were ﬁxed with 10%
cold glutaraldehyde (1% ﬁnal concentration), left in the dark for 10 min
at room temperature and then stored at -80 C. Two subsamples were
taken for separate counts of HB and PPP. For HB, 400-μl samples were
stained with SYBRGreen I (Sigma Aldrich®) diluted in DMSO to a ﬁnal
concentration of 1X, left for about 10 min in the dark to complete the
nucleic-acid staining and run in the ﬂow cytometer. A known volume of
beads (1-μm diameter, Fluospheres®) was added to unfrozen samples. HB
were detected by their signature in plots of side scatter light (SSC) versus
green ﬂuorescence of nucleic acid-bound stains FITC (FL1 530 nm) and
SSC (side scatter) axes (e.g. Gasol et al., 1999). Turbid samples were
previously diluted with pre-ﬁltered PBS (1:10). For PPP we used the same
procedure as for HB, but without stain addition. Picoplanktonic algae
were identiﬁed in plots of SSC versus blue laser-dependent red ﬂuores-
cence (PerCP or FL3, 670 nm), orange ﬂuorescence (PE or FL2 585/42
nm) versus FL3, and red laser-dependent far-red ﬂuorescence (APC or
FL4, 661 nm) versus FL3.
2.2.4. Analysis of the contribution of autotrophic fractions to total
autotrophic biomass
To compare the contribution of micro þ nanophytoplankton and PPP
populations to the autotrophic biomass at Tf, the biovolume of each size
fraction was calculated for control and herbicide treatments for clear and
turbid systems at Tf. The biovolume of micro þ nano phytoplankton was
calculated following Rott (1981) and Hillebrand et al. (1999). In regard
to PPP, a sphere with a theoretical size of 0.9 μm was considered for
PE-Pcy, PC-Pcy and PEuk, which represents a theoretical biovolume three
times higher than that of Pcy (Callieri, 2008).
2.3. Statistical and numerical analysis
The homogeneity of the e.u. was veriﬁed in terms of water turbidity,
for both turbid and clear systems, just before the addition of AsiMax 50®
by a Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA by ranks test (KW). Statis-
tical differences in turbidity, chlorophyll a concentration and abundance
of micro þ nano phytoplankton between turbidity states were analyzed
at Tf using one-way ANOVA (factor treatment ¼ control and six AsiMax
50® concentration levels). Multiple comparisons were carried out using
Tukey test. The Holm-Sidak method was used to compare treated and
control groups. RM-ANOVA was applied for testing the signiﬁcance of
PPP and HB counts, with two factors: time (T1 and Tf) and treatment
(control and six AsiMax 50® concentration levels). For nano þ micro
phytoplankton, a Pearson correlation matrix was calculated among the
abundances of live organisms of species from all treatments, for each type
of system. Species that were recorded more than ﬁve times in all samples
and in at least two e.u. of the same treatment, were included in the
analysis. These matrices were incorporated into Cytoscape® v 3.7.1
software (Shannon et al., 2003) to build networks among species. In
addition, the following indices were calculated (Magurran, 2013): rich-
ness (S); the Simpson index as 1-D, where D ¼ P
niðni1Þ
NðN1Þ

, ni is the
number of organisms of the ith species and N is the total number of or-
ganisms; and evenness E¼ (1/D)/S).
3. Results
3.1. Physical and chemical parameters
Real values of 2,4-D concentrations in water for each treatment at the
beginning of the experiment (T1) are shown in Table 1.
Turbidity values were 1.10  0.30 NTU and 9.29  0.85 NTU (mean
 SD) immediately before AsiMax 50® input to the clear and turbid water
systems, respectively. No signiﬁcant differences were found before Asi-
Max 50® addition between e.u. of the clear (KW, p ¼ 0.511) and turbid
(KW, p ¼ 0.199) systems. At Tf, mean values of turbidity from all e.u.
were 1.00  0.00 and 13.33  3.06 for the clear and turbid systems,
respectively. In the turbid system, signiﬁcant decreases in turbidity of
29%, 41% and 45% were observed at 20, 200 and 2,000 mg L1 of 2,4-D
compared to control at Tf, respectively (ANOVA; p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A).
3.2. Biological parameters
3.2.1. Chlorophyll a
At Tf, maximum chlorophyll a concentrations of 7.62 and 101.24 μg
L1 were recorded at the 2 mg L1 treatment under clear and turbid
conditions, respectively (Fig. 1B), while minimum values of 1.09 and
38.10 μg L1 were obtained at the 2,000 mg L1 treatment for the clear
and turbid systems, respectively. There were signiﬁcant decreases with
respect to control in the 2,000 mg L1 treatment: 36.7%, for the turbid
(ANOVA; p ¼ 0.006), and 76.9% for the clear system (ANOVA, p˂0.001).
3.2.2. Micro þ nano phytoplankton (>2 μm)
Table 2 shows a list of the species from the micro þ nanoplanktonic
fraction for the clear and turbid systems.
Chlorophyta was always the most important group, both in richness
and abundance. Under the clear condition and considering T0 and Tf, this
group made up 71% of the total micro þ nanoplankton abundance, fol-
lowed by Dinophyceae (12.1%), Bacillariophyceae (8.86%), Crysophy-
ceae (7.8%) and Cryptophyceae (0.2%). At T0, Chlorophyta represented
38.8% of the total abundance of the micro þ nano planktonic fraction. At
Tf, this group showed signiﬁcant increases in abundance between the
AsiMax 50® treatments and the control (ANOVA, p˂0.001), except for
2,000 mg L1, where the percentages of all groups were similar to those
at T0 (Fig. 2A). In the turbid system, Chlorophyta dominated in richness
and abundance, followed by Crysophyceae (1.2%), Cyanobacteria (0.8%)
and Dinophyceae (0.6%). At T0, Chlorophyta made up 95.7% of the total
abundance, and a signiﬁcant increase was observed at Tf (ANOVA p ¼

0.046), with a mean value of 97.7% for all treatments (Fig. 2B).
In the clear system, mean total abundance of micro þ nano plankton
at T0 was 2,324  352 individuals (ind) mL1, with 61.5% of live or-
ganisms (Fig. 3A). At Tf, mean total abundance for the control was ~5
times greater than that at T0 (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.003) while no AsiMax 50®
effect was found on total abundance. In the turbid system, mean total
abundance of micro þ nano plankton at T0 was 663,603  40,174 ind
mL1 (mean  SD), with 90.2% of live organisms (Fig. 3B). At Tf, no
signiﬁcant change was recorded for the control between T0 and Tf.
Moreover, the 0.02, 0.2, 2 and 20 mg L1 treatments led to a signiﬁcant
increase in the total abundance compared to control (ANOVA, p < 0.001,
p ¼ 0.003, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). On the other hand,
the 200 and 2000 mg L1 treatments did not differ signiﬁcantly in total
live abundances with respect to control. For both clear and turbid sys-
tems, data of the abundance of live organisms at Tf were ﬁtted to second-
order polynomial curves from all the herbicide treatments (Figs. 3 A and
B). Better ﬁt to a humped-shaped curve was found for the turbid (R2 ¼
0.64) compared with the clear (R2 ¼ 0.41) system.
The values of total live abundance of micro þ nano plankton
mentioned above were in agreement with the variations in abundance of
the most abundant species for each type of system. In the clear system,
Choricystis sp. was the dominant taxon in all treatments, followed by
Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. At Tf, the live abundance of
Choricystis sp. showed a signiﬁcant decrease with respect to control
(ANOVA, p ¼ 0.047), with a signiﬁcant increase in dead abundance
(ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 3C). Moreover, at Tf a signiﬁcant increase in
dead abundance was found for Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. in
the 2,000 mg L1 treatment (ANOVA, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001,
respectively). In the turbid system, Staurastrum sp. showed the highest

value of live abundance, with signiﬁcant increments in the 0.02, 0.2, 2
and 20 mg L1 treatments (Fig. 3D). A signiﬁcant increase in dead
abundance was found in the 2,000 mg L1 treatment (ANOVA, p<0.001).
This species was followed in live abundance by Chlamydomonas sp. and
Ochromonas sp., whose live and dead abundances did not show any clear
trend due to herbicide input (Fig. 3D). In summary, in the clear system
the micro þ nanoplanktonic fraction showed the largest difference in
composition between control and the 2,000 mg L1 treatment, while in
the turbid system its quali- and quantitative composition in the 200 and
2,000 mg L1 treatments was similar to that in the control.
Correlation networks of live abundance were constructed for micro þ
nanoplanktonic species to analyze the relationships among taxa exposed
to AsiMax 50® under clear and turbid conditions (Fig. 4). The networks
included 10 and 7 species for the clear and turbid systems, respectively.
Taxa were more signiﬁcantly and positively intercorrelated in the turbid
(mean r ¼ 0.62) than in the clear system (mean r ¼ 0.56). As already
mentioned, some species were present in both systems (i.e. Chlamydo-
monas sp., Staurastrum sp., Ochromonas sp., Tetraedron minimum and
Peridinium sp.). However, they responded differently to the herbicide
depending on the system. Chlamydomonas sp. was negatively affected in
the clear system but not in the turbid one (Fig. 3C). According to the
correlation network, the abundance of Chlamydomonas sp. was signiﬁ-
cantly and positively correlated with the most abundant species, Staur-
astrum sp. (r Pearson ¼ 0.60; p ¼ 0.002) (Fig. 4). In the clear system, no-
signiﬁcant correlation was observed between the abundances of Chla-
mydomonas sp. and of any of the species signiﬁcantly stimulated by the

herbicide. In the turbid system, Staurastrum sp. was the species most
strongly stimulated by AsiMax 50® (Fig. 3C) and the most correlated with
the subdominant taxa (Fig. 4). This trend was not observed in the clear
system, where the abundance of Staurastrum sp. was not correlated with
that of any other species. The abundance of Ochromonas sp. also varied
depending on the type of system, i.e. its abundance decreased in the clear
system, while it increased at low 2,4-D concentrations and decreased at
higher concentrations in the turbid one (Fig. 3C). The abundance of this
species was signiﬁcantly and positively correlated with that of Stauras-
trum sp. (r Pearson ¼ 0.72; p ¼ 0.0001), while it was not signiﬁcantly
correlated with that of any other species in the clear system (Fig. 4).
At T0, mean values of richness, diversity and evenness were higher in
the clear system (S ¼ 7.00  1.00, D ¼ 0.74  0.03 and E ¼ 0.57  0.14)
than in the turbid one (S ¼ 6.67  0.58, D ¼ 0.14  0.03 and E ¼ 0.17 
0.01. In general, at Tf, these parameters showed no signiﬁcant differ-
ences between herbicide treatments and control for both types of sys-
tems, except for the following: (a) for the clear system, a signiﬁcant
decrease in D (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.04) was observed in the 200 mg L1
treatment with respect to control, with D ¼ 0.29  0.13; (b) for the turbid
system, S and E decreased signiﬁcantly in the 200 mg L1 treatment, with
S ¼ 3.67  0.58 (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.006) and E ¼ 0.29  0.05 (ANOVA p ¼
0.041); and in the 2,000 mg L1 treatment, with S ¼ 3.00  1.00 (ANOVA
p˂0.001) and E ¼ 0.38  0.12 (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.001).
3.2.3. Cytometric populations (0.2–2 μm): PPP and HB
Cytograms of samples of control and herbicide treatments collected at
T1 and Tf revealed four cytometric populations, of which one corre-
sponded to HB, and the other three to photosynthetic populations: PEuk,
PC-Pcy and PE-Pcy. The HB was more abundant than PPP, both in the
clear and turbid systems, ranging between a maximum of 99.7% (clear,
Tf, 2,000 mg L1) and a minimum of 80.9% (turbid, Tf, 2,000 mg L1)
(Table 3). RM-ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant differences in the abundance
of HB and PPP between T1 and Tf for the clear and turbid systems (RM-
ANOVA, p ¼ 0.018 and p ¼ 0.001 respectively). In regard to treatment
effects, PPP showed signiﬁcant variations in abundance at 2,000 mg L1
of 2,4-D with a rapid signiﬁcant increment of ~5 times at T1 compared to
control (RM-ANOVA, p < 0.001 in both systems, Table 3). This increase
continued until Tf in the turbid system, while it did not in the clear one
(RM-ANOVA, p < 0.001). The same increase in abundance was observed
in the 200 mg L1 treatment (RM-ANOVA, p ¼ 0.003) for the turbid
system at Tf. The abundance of the HB fraction was signiﬁcantly
increased by ~3 times at Tf in the 2,000 mg L1 treatment only for the
clear system (ANOVA, p<0.001).
The abundance of the PPP cytometric populations was, on average,
higher in turbid than in clear systems.
PE-Pcy was the best represented group of the PPP populations,
ranging from 53.8% (Tf, 20 mg L1) to 99.2% (T1, 2,000 mg L1) for the
clear system and from 96.0% (Tf, 0.2 mg L1) to 99.0% (Tf, 2,000 mg
L1) for the turbid system (Fig. 5). For the clear system at T1, PEuk
abundance ranged between a minimum of 856  202 ind mL1 (200 mg
L1) to a maximum of 1,284  466 ind mL1 (2,000 mg mL1), with no
signiﬁcant differences among treatments (Fig. 6A). At Tf, PEuk abun-
dance ranged from 509  111 ind mL1 (2,000 mg L1) to 9,118  2,268
ind mL1 (control). RM-ANOVA analysis showed no signiﬁcant growth of
PEuk in microcosms treated with 2,000 mg L1 (RM-ANOVA, p ¼ 0.580),
while this population showed a signiﬁcant growth response in the rest of
the treatments, including controls. Such growth inhibition at 2,000 mg

L1 led to a signiﬁcant decrease in PEuk abundance of ~18 times at Tf,
compared to control (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 6A). In the turbid system at
T1, PEuk abundance ranged from 6,621  368 ind mL1 (0.02 mg L1) to
39,887  11,842 ind mL1 (2,000 mg L1). At this time, a signiﬁcant
increment of ~5 times compared to control was measured in the 2,000
mg L1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 6B). At Tf, the abundance of
this fraction ranged from 2,950  223 (20 mg L1) to 10,979  4,271
(2,000 mg L1), with no signiﬁcant differences between treatments and
control. The abundance of this population decreased signiﬁcantly be-
tween T1 and Tf for the 200 and 2,000 mg L1 treatments (RM-ANOVA, p
¼ 0.026 and p<0.001 respectively), resulting from an early growth and a
subsequent decrease.
In the clear system, PC-Pcy abundance ranged from a minimum mean
(SD) value of 166  29 (200 mg L1) to a maximum of 282  87 ind
mL1 (20 mg L1) at T1, while it ranged from 80  75 (0.02 mg L1) to

abundance ranged from 80  77 (0.2 mg L1) to 206  86 (200 mg L1)
at T1, and from 187  90 (0.2 mg L1) to 333  207 ind mL1 (0.02 mg
L1) at Tf (Fig. 6D). No signiﬁcant effects between treatments were found
in any case for this population.
PE-Pcy, the most abundant PPP fraction, at T1 ranged from 22,969 
2,530 (200 mg L1) to 164,130  48,443 ind mL1 (2,000 mg L1) in the
clear system. At this time, a signiﬁcant increase in PE-Pcy abundance of
~5 times was observed in relation to control in the 2,000 mg L1 treat-
ment (ANOVA, p˂<0.001) (Fig. 6E). At Tf, there were no signiﬁcant
variations, with a minimum of 15,527  8,418 (0.02 mg L1) and a
maximum of 23,553  4,497 ind mL1 (control). RM-ANOVA revealed
an early increase (at T1) in the abundance of this fraction in the 2,000 mg
L1 treatment, with a subsequent decline at Tf (RM-ANOVA, p<0.001).
In the turbid system, this fraction ranged from 62,626  44,171 (0.02 mg
L1) to 651,631  68,514 ind L1 (2,000 mg L1) at T1 and from 115,508
 16,676 (2 mg L1) to 853,987  230,227 ind L1 (2,000 mg L1) at Tf
(Fig. 6F). This population showed a signiﬁcant increase in abundance of
~4 times at T1, and of ~5 times at Tf in the 2,000 mg L1 treatment
compared to control (ANOVA, p0.001 in both cases). Also, an increase in
abundance of ~3 times was recorded in the 200 mg L1 treatment
(ANOVA, p˂0.001) at Tf for the turbid system (Fig. 6F). These increases
persisted between T1 and Tf for the 200 and 2,000 mg L1 treatments
(RM-ANOVA, p ¼ 0.004 and p ¼ 0.017, respectively).
At Tf, the percentage contribution of the different size autotrophic
fractions to total autotrophic biomass varied among groups (Table 4). For
the turbid system, micro þ nano phytoplankton showed a lower contri-
bution in the treatments at higher concentrations (200 and 2,000 mg L1)
(ANOVA, p ¼ 0.005 and p<0.001, respectively). This decrease was in
accordance with the increase in the percentage contribution of the PE-
Pcy fraction at 200 mg L1 (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.004), as well as with the
increase in the percentage contribution of both PE-Pcy (ANOVA,
p<0.001) and PEuk (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.002) fractions at 2,000 mg L1.
In general, in the turbid system there were signiﬁcant correlations
between chlorophyll a concentration and the percentage contribution of
micro þ nano phytoplankton (r Pearson ¼ 0.66; p ¼ 0.0012), PEuk (r
Pearson ¼ -0.62; p ¼ 0.0029) and PE-Pcy (r Pearson ¼ -0.66; p ¼ 0.0011).
On the contrary, no correlations were found between these variables in
the clear system.
4. Discussion
Our results strongly suggest that the degree of water turbidity affects
the response of the studied freshwater populations exposed for 7 days to
the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50®. We found differences in the
structural integrity of the phytoplankton and picoplankton communities
from low to high concentrations of the active ingredient.
The impact of AsiMax 50® on micro þ nano phytoplankton seemed to
be greater in the turbid than in the clear system, in terms of both richness
and abundance. An experimental effect of the clear system on this frac-
tion was likely to occur between T0 and Tf, compared to control. This was
not observed in the turbid system and may be attributable to a
“conﬁnement effect” (Pesce et al., 2009), which takes place after samples
collected from a natural system are placed into microcosms of lower
volume. At T0, phytoplankton diversity, richness and evenness were
higher in the clear than in the turbid system. At Tf, no decrease in
phytoplankton richness was observed for any treatment in the clear
system, while it decreased signiﬁcantly at 200 and 2,000 mg L1 of 2,4-D
in the turbid system. This suggests that some species cannot survive at the
higher herbicide concentrations, in agreement with that reported for 2,
4-D by Kobraei and White (1996). Communities with high levels of di-
versity tend to be more resilient to environmental changes (Oliver et al.,
2015), due to redundancy among different species sharing similar func-
tions. Resilience increases if these species also show differential resis-
tance to a contaminant. Indeed, Girvan et al. (2005) have demonstrated
that bacterial diversity in soils promotes community stability and resil-
ience after benzene perturbation. In the case of phytoplankton, it is
expected that the differential sensitivity of species to herbicides (Huertas
et al., 2010) as well as their presence and relative abundance, will
determine the response of the community as a whole. The richer the
community, the greater the chance for the presence of tolerant or resis-
tant species to a contaminant, and the response of the community will
rely upon the evenness and sensitivity of the dominant species, if any.
In general, natural or anthropogenic agents induce a wide range of
responses in biological entities, according to their scale of complexity
(Peck, 2011). For example, variations in total abundance may reﬂect
different physiological strategies. In our study, phytoplanktonic species
that survived at 2,000 mg L1 of 2,4-D in the clear system and at 200 and
2,000 mg L1 of 2,4-D in the turbid system showed low abundance values
due to decreased reproduction. A similar behavior was observed for
phytoplankton exposed to the commercial glyphosate-based formulation
RoundUp®, which had no effect on species richness but produced a sig-
niﬁcant strong decrease in total abundance (Perez et al., 2007).
The abundance of the micro þ nano phytoplankton community
decreased at higher concentrations and increased at lower concentrations
of 2,4-D (0.02; 0.2; 2 and 20 mg L1), with a humped-shaped, dose-
dependent response. This effect was more clearly noted in the turbid than
in the clear system. Although we used a commercial formulation with
undeclared ingredients to obtain a more realistic approach, stimulation
effects on phytoplankton are consistent with those previously reported
for the active principle. In this regard, further experiments comparing the
effects of pure 2,4-D and AsiMax® are required for a more conclusive
assessment. Nevertheless, the stimulation of phytoplankton at low doses
of 2,4-D has been already reported in studies involving algal monoculture
trials and mesocosms (Boyle, 1980; Kobraei and White, 1996; Wong,
2000). The auxin pathways and their modes of action are well-known for
vascular plants, but not for algae (Zizkova et al., 2016) and after many
years of debate (Lau et al., 2009), the presence of auxin pathways in algae
and cyanobacteria was ﬁnally conﬁrmed by Sergeeva et al. (2002).
Certainly, the fact that 2,4-D induces growth at low doses and causes
growth inhibition at higher ones provides evidence that it may mimic
hormonal function.
Moreover, the presence or absence of auxin pathways in the different
species (e.g. Staurastrum sp., dominant in the turbid system) occurring in
each community, could be determinant for the whole community
response. Zizkova et al. (2016) demonstrated that some cyanobacteria
and algae that differ taxonomically possess different concentrations of
IAA. They found that four species of Chlamydomonales have low IAA
concentration, while some Desmidiales, the same group as that of
Staurastrum sp., have high IAA concentration. Different sensitivity was
observed for Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. that were present in
both kinds of systems. These species tended to decrease in abundance
with respect to control in the clear system while they tended to increase
in the turbid one. The impact of 2,4-D on the community may not only be
direct, according to species sensitivity but also indirect, via the in-
teractions among community members. The differential absorption
and/or utilization of the 2,4-D by certain species may indirectly affect the
total abundance of others. In our case, it is possible that the intake of 2,
4-D by the dominant Staurastrum sp. limited the exposure of other species
to the herbicide. In addition, the 2,4-D may indirectly affect the fresh-
water community through ecological interactions such as competition,
facilitation and/or predation. Numerous examples of these indirect ef-
fects due to different contaminants can be found in the comprehensive
review by Fleeger et al. (2003). In our study, the sensitivity of Chlamy-
domonas sp. to 2,4-D detected in the clear system was probably masked in
the turbid one by Staurastrum sp. growth. A similar process would have
occurred for Ochromonas sp. The correlation network analyses suggest
that the 2,4-D stimulated the growth of Staurastrum sp. when it was
predominant through a putative auxin pathway, and that this allowed the
development of other species that are actually sensitive to 2,4-D. In brief,
the capacity of Staurastrum sp. to rapidly absorb the contaminant may
have decreased the exposure of other species in the turbid system. The
fact that Staurastrum sp. occurred in the clear system but in a very low

proportion may indicate that not only species composition but also their
relative abundance are important to predict the behavior of the system in
response to a contaminant. The comparison of the correlation networks
indicated that species were less intercorrelated in the clear system than in
the turbid one, suggesting greater community stability for the former
than for the latter under herbicide stress. In a less stable community, the
change in one species affects the other species. The difﬁculty of deter-
mining the processes that control the responses of a given species
strongly underlines the need to be cautious when extrapolating results
from monospeciﬁc assays to realistic ﬁeld situations.
Lozano et al. (2018), who performed a microcosm experiment with
the same Staurastrum sp. as used here but collected from a phytoplank-
tonic community with different structural characteristics, reported that it
always decreased in abundance after exposure at different concentrations
of 2,4-D in pure form. This suggests that the same species may respond
differently to agrochemicals depending, on one hand, on the character-
istics of their phytoplankton community and, on the other hand, on the
form of the chemical assayed (i.e. pure versus formulation). AsiMax 50® is
a commercial formulation based on 2,4-D as active ingredient, with
coadjuvants and other substances. The use of active ingredient and/or
commercial formulations makes the comparison across assays difﬁcult.
The impacts of active ingredients and commercial formulations on
freshwater organisms and/or communities have been well documented
for different herbicides (Tsui and Chu, 2003; Annett et al., 2014; Lipok
et al., 2010; De Stefano et al., 2018).
The signiﬁcant increase in the abundance of HB was only observed at
the highest 2,4-D concentration in the clear system, probably because the
herbicide acted as a nutrient source for bacterial growth. On the other
hand, the HB did not show a signiﬁcant growth in the turbid system
probably because its initial abundance was sufﬁcient to metabolize the
herbicide. Pizarro et al. (2016) studied the impact of glyphosate formu-
lation Glifosato Atanor® on microbial communities from clear and
organic turbid freshwater systems. In agreement with our study, they
found that abundance of bacteria only increased in clear water, most
likely because the herbicide was used as nutrient source. The effect of 2,
4-D on bacterial communities has been studied by Aguayo et al. (2014),
who observed that the phylum Actinobacteria was predominant at 20 mg
L1 of 2,4-D, using water from a cold and pristine oligotrophic lake.
Likewise, De Lipthay et al. (2003) reported that a long-term exposure of a
subsurface aquifer to a mixture of auxinic herbicides at low concentra-
tions (<40 μg L1) induced the increment of phenoxy acid-degrading
bacteria.
The PPP fraction also seemed to experience more pronounced
changes in the turbid than in the clear system. It showed a rapid response
after 15 min at the highest herbicide concentration in both clear and
turbid systems, which was determined by the different behavior of their
respective components. This effect was due to a rapid increase in the
abundance of PE-Pcy in the clear system and of PEuk and PE-Pcy in the
turbid one. The PPP fraction also showed an increase in abundance at the
higher herbicide concentrations at Tf in the turbid system. This was
mediated by an increase in the PE-Pcy fraction, which was probably
stimulated by the combination of direct and indirect effects of AsiMax
50®. The herbicide would act directly on the PE-Pcy fraction if it had
auxin pathways, and in this regard Zizkova et al. (2016) found that two
species of cyanobacteria (Chroococcus minutus and Phormidium animale)
contained very high amounts of endogenous auxin (IAA). On the other
hand, the decrease in the micro þ nano plankton in the same treatments
could have indirectly stimulated the growth of PE-Pcy due to decreased
competitive pressure.
Changes in micro þ nano phytoplankton and PPP abundance
accounted for changes in chlorophyll a concentration; this is particularly
true for the former fraction, which represented more than 99% of the
total phytoplanktonic biomass. This phenomenon was more clearly
observed in the turbid system, where chlorophyll a concentration fol-
lowed a similar hump-shaped, dose-dependence pattern as that obtained
for micro þ nano phytoplankton abundance. Changes in turbidity
resembled those in chlorophyll a concentration, especially for the turbid
system, where both variables decreased to lower levels.
The Pampa Plain in Argentina has plenty of permanent shallow lakes
with contrasting water turbidity and phytoplankton biomass. It is one of
the principal agricultural regions worldwide, where millions of liters of
agrochemicals are used each year. The present investigation provides
new evidence on the mode of action of the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax
50® in freshwater, which is one of the most frequently used commercial
formulations in agricultural ﬁelds of Argentina. The observed variations
in the essential constituents of microbial food chains can produce major
functional changes, which are mainly concerned with carbon ﬂuxes
affecting the whole dynamics of a freshwater ecosystem. National regu-
latory agencies establish environmentally safe concentrations of agro-
chemicals mainly based on results from monoculture experiments.
However, this study provides evidence that such concentrations can be
unrealistic because species exhibit different behavior when growing in a
community. Despite the limitations of the experimental system, our re-
sults highlight the importance of using community-scale approaches in
ecotoxicological studies to predict the sense, magnitude and direction of
changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to 2,4-D formulations.
