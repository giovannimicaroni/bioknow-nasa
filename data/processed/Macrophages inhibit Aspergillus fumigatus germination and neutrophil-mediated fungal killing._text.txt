Abstract
In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal disease
that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms control A. fumigatus in immu-
nocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to
visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A. fumi-
gatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a
protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting
fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-
mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-
derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Addition-
ally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by
neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-
derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating
the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether,
we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of A. fumigatus and highlight the
ability of different A. fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.
Author summary
Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to invasive fungal infections, including
aspergillosis. However, healthy humans inhale spores of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus
from the environment every day without becoming sick, and how the immune system
clears this infection is still obscure. Additionally, there are many different strains of A.
fumigatus, and whether the pathogenesis of these different strains varies is also largely
unknown. To investigate these questions, we infected larval zebrafish with A. fumigatus
spores derived from two genetically diverse strains. Larval zebrafish allow for visualization

of fungal growth and innate immune cell behavior in live, intact animals. We find that dif-
ferences in the rate of growth between strains directly affect fungal persistence. In both
wild-type and macrophage-deficient zebrafish larvae, a fast-germinating strain is actually
cleared better than a slow-germinating strain. This fungal killing is driven primarily by
neutrophils while macrophages promote fungal persistence by inhibiting spore germina-
tion. Our experiments underline different mechanisms of virulence that pathogens can
utilize—rapid growth versus dormancy and persistence—and inform future strategies for
fighting fungal infections in susceptible immunocompromised patients.
Introduction
Humans inhale hundreds of Aspergillus fumigatus spores from the environment every day and
yet almost all immunocompetent individuals successfully contend with the fungal infection.
Immunocompromised patients, however, especially acute leukemia patients, hematopoietic
cell transplant recipients, and solid-organ transplant recipients, are at risk of developing inva-
sive aspergillosis [1]. In invasive disease, Aspergillus spores germinate into filamentous hyphae
and invade and destroy tissues and organs, with mortality rates as high as 50 to 60% in patient
populations [1]. Limited antifungal treatments exist and there is growing resistance among
fungi to these drugs [2]. The development of successful immunotherapy-based treatments
to this infection requires a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay of immune
mechanisms that control Aspergillus in vivo.
In immunocompetent individuals, the innate immune system is generally sufficient for A.
fumigatus clearance, with both macrophages and neutrophils playing major roles [3]. Macro-
phages primarily target and phagocytose conidia (spores), and can kill conidia in vitro within
hours [4, 5]. In vivo, however, the requirement for and role of macrophages is unclear, with
some studies reporting no effect on survival in macrophage-depleted mice [6] and others dem-
onstrating an increased fungal burden in such mice [7]. Neutrophils, on the other hand, are
consistently required in mice in response to Aspergillus [6, 8], and neutropenia is a key risk fac-
tor for patients in the development of invasive aspergillosis [9]. Neutrophils can kill conidia in
vivo [10] and inhibit conidial germination both in vitro and in vivo [11, 12]. Immune cell popu-
lations can also influence the activity of other immune cell types, and CCR2+ inflammatory
monocytes can increase neutrophil function in response to Aspergillus through pro-inflamma-
tory gene expression [13, 14]. However, the full extent of macrophage/monocyte and neutro-
phil interactions throughout the course of infection, and their effect on fungal growth and
clearance, are not known.
Perhaps the most important step in Aspergillus pathogenesis is germination, the develop-
mental switch from resting, dormant conidia to filamentous, invasive growth [15]. These
different fungal forms induce differential activation of immune cells in vitro and recruitment
of these cells in vivo [16–18]. After invasive hyphae have developed, neutrophils can respond
with a variety of killing mechanisms [11, 19–21]. However, how this switch, and specifically
earlier stages of fungal germination prior to the development of extensive invasive growth,
affects immune activation, fungal clearance, and disease progression in vivo is largely
unknown.
Larval zebrafish provide an ideal model in which to study the early effects of fungal germi-
nation as well as the interplay between multiple immune cell types throughout infection.
Larval zebrafish are transparent and can be non-invasively imaged and therefore allow for
visualization of innate immune cell behavior and fungal development in a live, intact host

throughout a multi-day infection. While murine models require enormous fungal inoculums
(~107 conidia) and host immunosuppression in order to directly visualize immune cell-patho-
gen encounters within the context of host tissue, the larval zebrafish allows for visualization of
smaller doses (10–100 conidia) in wild-type hosts [22]. Aspergillus infection models in zebra-
fish have already been developed by our lab and others and recapitulate many aspects of
human and mouse infection, including initial phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages and
post-germination neutrophil recruitment [21, 23]. These models have already provided new
insight into the biology of immune responses to Aspergillus such as the observation of spore
transfer between macrophages [24].
In this study, we have infected larval zebrafish with Aspergillus fumigatus strains derived
from patient isolates Af293 and CEA10. Heterogeneity among A. fumigatus isolates has been
increasingly recognized [25], and Af293 and CEA10 in particular are known to be differentially
virulent in specific mouse and zebrafish models [26–28]. The genomes of these strains differ
by ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which is an approximately average level
of genetic diversity among sequenced A. fumigatus isolates [28]. Af293 and CEA10 strains also
possess differences in growth [27], activation of the host immune response [27, 29], response
to hypoxia [26], secondary metabolism [30, 31], and response to light [32]. We aimed to use
these two different strains coupled with live imaging in larval zebrafish to identify and charac-
terize differential neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to A. fumigatus infection.
We report that while CEA10 is generally regarded as more virulent than Af293 [26, 27],
CEA10-derived strains are killed better than Af293-derived strains in vivo, even while CEA10-
derived strains germinate faster. Host inflammatory activation, partially through Myd88, is
required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain, but strikingly, is not sufficient for clearance
of an Af293-derived strain. Macrophages only marginally contribute to clearance of CEA10-
derived strains. Instead, macrophages primarily provide a protective niche for spores, forming
tight, dense clusters around the fungus, inhibiting spore germination. Our data demonstrate
that germination actually drives fungal clearance through neutrophil-mediated killing.
Results
A CEA10-derived strain of Aspergillusfumigatus is killed better than an
Af293-derived strain in vivo
Differences in the virulence of two common lab strains isolated from patients, Af293 and
CEA10, have been reported, but the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incom-
pletely understood [26–28]. In particular, the ability of wild-type hosts to contend with and
clear these two different infections is not known. To investigate such clearance, we decided to
apply a published method to visually quantify Aspergillus spore killing [10], to our established
model of Aspergillus infection in transparent zebrafish larvae [21], giving us the ability to visu-
alize fungal killing in a live, intact host. This live-dead staining method utilizes Aspergillus
strains expressing a fluorescent protein (in these experiments, YFP or GFP) and coated in an
AlexaFluor molecule of a different color (here, AlexaFluor594). Live spores are visualized as
YFP/GFP signal surrounded by AlexaFluor signal, while killed spores appear as AlexaFluor sig-
nal only. We used strains derived from Af293 and CEA10 that express YFP and GFP, tagged to
cytosolic proteins. Throughout this paper we will refer to Af293-derived and CEA10-derived
strains in the text and figures as simply Af293 and CEA10, respectively, for ease of discussion,
but we list actual strains used for each experiment in figure legends and the details of all strains
in Methods.
We injected dual-labeled spores into the hindbrain of wild-type 2 day post fertilization
(dpf) zebrafish larvae and imaged this hindbrain region; all images presented throughout this

study are oriented as indicated (Fig 1A). Confocal imaging of these larvae 2 days post injection
(dpi) revealed that CEA10 is killed significantly better than Af293, with a higher percentage of
dual-labeled AlexaFluor594+, YFP/GFP+ spores in an Af293 infection compared to a CEA10
infection (Fig 1B and 1C). These results were surprising to us given that CEA10 has been
reported to be more virulent than Af293 in some immunosuppressed mouse models of infec-
tion [26, 27] as well as in data from our lab in neutrophil-defective zebrafish larvae [28]. To
confirm this difference in fungal killing, we quantified colony-forming units (CFUs) from
homogenized single larvae over the course of a 5 day infection. This experiment recapitulated
the finding that fungal burden of this CEA10 strain is controlled significantly better by larval
zebrafish than the Af293 strain (Fig 1D). While Af293 persists in larvae throughout the course
of infection, CEA10 is slowly cleared, so that by 2 dpi, the fungal burden in CEA10-infected
larvae is significantly lower than that of Af293-infected larvae. Additionally, by 3 dpi, CEA10
fungal burden is significantly less than the initial dose. Af293 is never significantly cleared
compared to the initial burden under the experimental conditions. We also confirmed that

this trend holds for multiple Af293- and CEA10-derived strains, as well as the parental strains
(S1 Fig).
Myd88-mediated inflammatory activation is required for clearance of a
CEA10-derived strain
Compared to Af293, CEA10 differentially activates specific inflammatory pathways in mice
[27], and we first hypothesized that the differential killing of CEA10 was due to greater inflam-
matory activation. We utilized an NF-κB RE:EGFP reporter line [33] to measure differences in
NF-κB activation after infection with Af293- or CEA10-derived non-fluorescent strains in lar-
val zebrafish. At 2 dpi, CEA10-infected larvae have significantly more GFP signal and therefore
NF-κB activation than Af293-infected larvae at the infection site, indicating that NF-κB activa-
tion is correlated with fungal killing (Fig 2A and 2B).
To determine whether general immune activation is required for fungal killing, we treated
larvae with the corticosteroid dexamethasone immediately after spore injection. Neither Af293
nor CEA10 caused much death in control larvae, consistent with previous results in our zebra-
fish model and the idea that wild-type hosts can largely control Aspergillus infection [21].
Treatment with dexamethasone, however, caused both Af293- and CEA10-infected larvae to
succumb rapidly and equally to infection (Fig 2C), consistent with the identical virulence of
these two strains observed in a chemotherapeutic mouse model [26]. Control PBS-injected lar-
vae treated with dexamethasone had minimal death (S2A Fig). Similar results were obtained
after treatment with withaferin A, a non-specific inhibitor of NF-κB (S2B Fig). These results
suggest that while CEA10 infection induces significantly more activation of NF-κB, under gen-
eral immunosuppressive conditions, neither of these strains can be controlled by the host.
Both dexamethasone and withaferin A have broad effects, therefore we next investigated
the role of specific pathways upstream of NF-κB in fungal killing. Myd88 is an adaptor mole-
cule downstream of TLR/IL-1R signaling that has previously been implicated in the response
to Aspergillus [34, 35]. myd88-/- larvae are more susceptible to CEA10, but not Af293, infection
compared to wild-type controls (Fig 2D), consistent with the idea that Myd88-mediated
immune activation is required specifically for the response to CEA10. This increase in suscep-
tibility to a CEA10 strain of myd88-/- larvae coincided with a significantly decreased ability to
clear CEA10 fungal burden, while loss of Myd88 had no effect on Af293 fungal burden (Fig 2E
and 2F). Knockdown of myd88 did not inhibit activation of the NF-κB RE:EGFP reporter
line by a CEA10-derived strain (S2C and S2D Fig). This is could be due to 1) other pathways
that also activate NF-κB and/or 2) increased fungal growth in these larvae resulting in more
inflammation. Together, these results show that CEA10 induces a more robust inflammatory
response than Af293 and Myd88-dependent signaling is required for clearance of CEA10 fun-
gal burden.
CEA10-induced inflammatory activation is not sufficient for killing of
Af293
To specifically test whether the increased immune activation induced by this CEA10 infection
is sufficient for fungal killing, we co-infected larvae with a red fluorescent Af293-derived strain
and a green fluorescent CEA10-derived strain and performed CFU counts throughout a 5 day
infection. As shown previously, in single infections this CEA10 strain is cleared over the course
of infection while the Af293 strain persists (Figs 1D and 3A). In a co-infection, this same pat-
tern remained—Af293 was not significantly cleared, even in the presence of an immune-acti-
vating CEA10 strain (Fig 3A). Imaging experiments confirmed that these spores can be found

in the same or neighboring cells (Figs 3B, 3C and S3), suggesting that these killing differences
are not due to local variation in immune activation, but instead to fungal-intrinsic phenotypes.
Macrophages form tight, persistent, and dynamic clusters around A.
fumigatus
To further determine the mechanism by which this CEA10 strain of A. fumigatus is killed, we
utilized the multi-day imaging capabilities of larval zebrafish to monitor the recruitment and
behavior of macrophages and neutrophils in individual larvae over the course of a five day

infection. By following individual larvae with both labeled macrophage nuclei (mpeg1:
mcherry-H2B) and neutrophils (lyz:BFP) throughout a 5 day infection, we aimed to determine
both differences in immune cell recruitment within larvae over time and population-level dif-
ferences between larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain versus an Af293-derived strain.
On a population level, CEA10 infection recruited more macrophages and neutrophils than
Af293 infection, throughout the entire time course (Fig 4A and 4B). These differences were
significant as early as 2 dpi and up to 5 dpi (Fig 4A and 4B). However, the number of macro-
phages and neutrophils present at the site of infection was also dynamic, fluctuating from day
to day in individual larvae (Fig 4A and 4B). In general, immune cell recruitment peaked at 2
dpi, decreasing slowly afterwards, coinciding with the timeline of fungal clearance (Fig 1D).
During this imaging, we were surprised to find that these recruited phagocytes form tight
clusters around the injected A. fumigatus, as early as 1 dpi, that persist throughout the five
day infection (Figs 4C, 4D and S4A, S1 Movie). These clusters were primarily made up of

macrophages, but neutrophils also infiltrated, generally arriving after macrophages (Figs
4C and S4A). These macrophages form tight associations, with their membranes directly
opposed and without space between the cells (Fig 4E). Germination of A. fumigatus spores
inside the clusters could be found (S4A Fig). We also observed the apical extrusion of a clus-
ter out of the hindbrain of two larvae, suggesting extrusion is a possible but rare mechanism
for the host to eliminate the infection (S4B Fig). Quantification of phagocyte cluster size
demonstrates that significantly larger clusters form in response to CEA10 compared to
Af293, consistent with differences in observed numbers of phagocytes recruited (Fig 4C
and 4D). Additionally, the size of these clusters is dynamic, changing in individual larvae
throughout the course of infection, but also peaking at 2 dpi and decreasing in size as the
infection is cleared (Fig 4C and 4D).

A CEA10-derived strain is more virulent than an Af293-derived strain in a
neutrophil-defective host
Since macrophages are the predominant cell type infiltrating the site of infection and forming
clusters around the fungus, we hypothesized that macrophages contribute to killing of
CEA10-derived strains of A. fumigatus. Macrophages and neutrophils are the predominant
immune cell types present in zebrafish larvae at this stage of development [36] and therefore,
to determine the ability of macrophages alone to kill A. fumigatus in vivo, we performed
fungal CFU counts after infection of a neutrophil-defective host (mpx:rac2D57N). These larvae
express a dominant-negative copy of Rac2 under a neutrophil-specific promoter, preventing
the migration of neutrophils out of the vasculature [37]. Consistent with previous observations
(Fig 1), an Af293-derived strain was not significantly cleared in either neutrophil-defective or
control hosts (Fig 5A). However, 2 dpi, neutrophil-defective larvae are able to decrease fungal
burden of a CEA10-derived strain equivalently to the control, to ~60% of the initial dose (Fig
5A), indicating that early in infection macrophages have a low-level killing ability against
CEA10. However, at 3 dpi, CFUs from these neutrophil-defective larvae increase, demonstrat-
ing that macrophages alone cannot contain the growth of CEA10 (Fig 5A). Because these lar-
vae have fewer functional immune cells in total, we also tested a lower dose of CEA10, but
found that the infectious dose did not have any effect on percent of fungal clearance (S5 Fig).
Over 80% of these neutrophil-defective larvae succumb to infection with CEA10 (Fig 5B).
To compare the relative likelihood of neutrophil-defective larvae to succumb to CEA10 versus
Af293 infection, we calculated hazard ratios, which represent the relative instantaneous risk of
death throughout the experiment between two conditions. This calculation revealed that while
neutrophil-defective larvae are significantly more susceptible to both Af293 and CEA10 infec-
tions than control larvae, these hosts are ~3 times more likely to succumb to CEA10 infection
than Af293 infection (Fig 5B), consistent with our previous results in this zebrafish line [28].
So, while CEA10 is cleared significantly more than Af293 in wild-type larvae, it is also more

virulent in a neutrophil-defective host. Altogether, these data suggest that macrophages do not
account for the majority of fungal killing, instead implicating neutrophils.
Macrophages provide a protective niche for CEA10
To specifically investigate the function of neutrophils in the response to these two A. fumigatus
strains, we next infected macrophage-deficient larvae (irf8-/-). These zebrafish lack the tran-
scription factor Irf8, and do not develop macrophages for the first 7 days after fertilization
[38]. We again enumerated CFUs after infection with either an Af293-derived or a CEA10-
derived strain. Remarkably, these macrophage-deficient larvae are able to clear CEA10 signifi-
cantly more than control larvae (Fig 6A). While, again, wild-type hosts significantly decrease
CEA10 fungal burden by 3 dpi, at 2 dpi almost 100% of injected CEA10 is cleared in macro-
phage-deficient hosts (Fig 6A). Consequently, when we monitored survival, CEA10-infected
macrophage-deficient larvae succumbed to infection at an almost identical rate as wild-type
controls (Fig 6B). Af293, on the other hand, was not significantly cleared in macrophage-

deficient larvae (Fig 6A) and Af293 infection did result in significantly more death in macro-
phage-deficient larvae compared to controls (Fig 6B), consistent with previous results in zebra-
fish with this strain [21].
As a consequence of Irf8 deficiency, these larvae also develop a larger number of neutro-
phils [38]. However, larvae injected with clodronate liposomes also cleared a CEA10-derived
strain, but not an Af293-derived strain, significantly better than control PBS liposome-injected
larvae at 1 dpi (Fig 6C). As clodronate liposome injection specifically depletes macrophages
without affecting neutrophils (S6A Fig), this result suggests that this increased early clearance
is a specific consequence of macrophage depletion. Clodronate liposome-injected larvae do
however succumb to infection (Figs 6D and S6B), indicating either that a larger number of
neutrophils is required for complete fungal clearance and host survival in the absence of mac-
rophages, and/or that clodronate liposomes affect neutrophil function without altering neutro-
phil numbers. These data demonstrate that the presence of macrophages actually protects
injected CEA10 spores, but not Af293 spores, from neutrophil-mediated killing at early time
points after infection, and suggest that macrophages might provide a protective niche for sur-
vival of certain fungal strains.
CEA10 recruits more neutrophils than Af293 in macrophage-deficient
hosts
To quantify neutrophil recruitment in the absence of macrophages, we performed sudan black
staining 1 dpi in macrophage-deficient irf8-/- or control larvae (Fig 7A–7C). Strikingly, in
~50% of macrophage-deficient larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain, we observed
extensive neutrophil recruitment that resulted in a mass of sudan black staining (Fig 7A and
7B). These sudan black masses were also sometimes observed in macrophage-deficient larvae
infected with an Af293-derived strain, but significantly less so, and were rarely observed in
control infected larvae. We quantified the number of neutrophils recruited to the infection
site, finding significantly more recruitment in irf8-/- larvae infected with an CEA10-derived
strain compared to an Af293-derived strain (Fig 7C). These data indicate that in the absence of
macrophages, high numbers of neutrophils are specifically recruited to CEA10 infections.
Macrophages inhibit A. fumigatus germination
These results raise the question of what signals promote neutrophil recruitment to CEA10
in the absence of macrophages. Since neutrophils have been reported to respond specifically
to hyphal forms of A. fumigatus [21], we hypothesized that macrophages inhibit spore germi-
nation. Indeed, the massive neutrophil recruitment we observed in irf8-/- macrophage-defi-
cient larvae was often accompanied by fungal germination and hyphal growth (Fig 7A). In
fact, the percentage of larvae with hyphae present was higher in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient
hosts compared to wild-type hosts after infection with either an Af293-derived or a CEA10-
derived strain (Fig 7D), suggesting that the presence of macrophages inhibits A. fumigatus ger-
mination. Similar results were seen in clodronate liposome-injected larvae (S7A Fig). Previous
experiments also suggest this rate of germination may be an underestimate for CEA10 infec-
tion since this fungus is cleared so effectively in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient conditions (Fig
6A). These data suggest that in the absence of macrophages, fungal germination induces sig-
nals that recruit neutrophils.
Myd88 is not required for neutrophil-mediated fungal killing
Germination unmasks fungal cell wall components such as β-glucans that can be sensed by the
host through TLR and CLR pathways [18]. Given our previous observation that the signaling

molecule Myd88 is required for full clearance of a CEA10 strain (Fig 2F), we hypothesized that
Myd88 is involved in neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection after spore germination.
While Myd88 has been shown to be dispensable for neutrophil-intrinsic anti-fungal activity, it
can be required in other cell types such as epithelial cells for neutrophil recruitment to A. fumi-
gatus infections [34]. To determine if neutrophil-mediated killing of CEA10 in the absence of

macrophages requires Myd88 signaling, we combined the myd88-/- mutant line with macro-
phage-deficiency (irf8 morpholino). We performed CFU counts at just 1 dpi since neutrophil-
mediated clearance of CEA10 in the absence of macrophages occurs rapidly (Fig 6A). Consis-
tent with previous results, at 1 dpi CEA10 is not cleared in wild-type hosts, while Irf8 defi-
ciency alone led to significantly increased clearance (Figs 7E and S7B). However, we observed
virtually identical clearance in macrophage-deficient hosts that also lacked Myd88 (Figs 7E
and S7B). These data demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil-mediated killing
of germinated spores of a CEA10-derived strain, but instead that neutrophil activation signals
are likely transduced through other pathways.
A CEA10-derived strain germinates earlier than an Af293-derived strain in
vivo
Given our findings that neutrophils respond primarily to germinated A. fumigatus spores and
that neutrophils are much better fungal killers than macrophages, we hypothesized that the
increased killing of CEA10 compared to Af293 might be attributable to differences in germina-
tion and hyphal growth of these strains. CEA10 has been shown to germinate faster than
Af293 in liquid culture in vitro [28] and more germinated spores of CEA10 compared to Af293
were found in the lungs of infected mice [27], but germination rates of these two strains have
not been directly measured in vivo. To measure fungal growth in vivo, we infected both wild-
type and phagocyte-deficient (pu.1 morphant) larvae with YFP- or GFP-expressing spores of
strains derived from either CEA10 or Af293. Phagocyte-deficient larvae succumb quickly to
infection with either strain, but on average CEA10 infection results in death one day earlier
than Af293 infection (Fig 8A), suggesting CEA10 grows faster in vivo. Similar results were
obtained with several CEA10- and Af293-derived strains (S8 Fig). To directly monitor fungal
development and growth over time, we imaged these larvae every day for five days of infection
(or until larvae succumbed). After only 1 day of infection, we observed pervasive growth of
CEA10 in phagocyte-deficient hosts (Fig 8B). While both Af293 and CEA10 spores had germi-
nated after 1 day, CEA10 had already developed invasive hyphae throughout the hindbrain.
We quantified how long it took individual larvae to exhibit both germinated spores (Fig 8C)
and invasive hyphae (Fig 8D). These data confirmed that CEA10 both germinates significantly
faster and grows into invasive hyphae significantly faster than Af293 in both wild-type and
phagocyte-deficient hosts (Fig 8C and 8D). Quantification of fungal burden by measuring
GFP+ area from these images also reflected greater growth of CEA10 and a ~1 day delay in
Af293 growth (Fig 8E).
Germination drives neutrophil-mediated fungal killing
To investigate the role of germination in neutrophil recruitment, we injected heat-killed spores
into macrophage-deficient irf8-/- larvae and quantified the presence of sudan black masses in
the hindbrain that we observed previously (Fig 7A and 7B). We found that heat-killed spores
do not recruit neutrophils, suggesting that spore germination and fungal growth is required
for neutrophil recruitment (Fig 9A).
However, immune cell killing activity against heat-killed spores cannot be measured, there-
fore to investigate the role of germination in fungal clearance, we utilized A. fumigatus pyrG-
deficient strains, which are auxotrophic for uridine-uracil and are known to have impaired
germination and attenuated virulence in mice [39]. To determine if these strains also have
impaired germination in larval zebrafish we infected phagocyte-deficient larvae (pu.1 mor-
phant) and measured survival as well as germination. Indeed, germination of a CEA10-derived
pyrG-deficient strain is abrogated in larval zebrafish and both CEA10- and Af293-derived

pyrG-deficient strains cause minimal death in both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient larvae
(Figs 9B and S9).
We infected wild-type larvae with Af293 and CEA10 pyrG- and pyrG+ reconstituted strains
and performed CFU counts to determine the requirement for germination in fungal killing in
the presence of both macrophages and neutrophils. Again, Af293 was not cleared significantly

and the pyrG mutation did not have a significant effect on fungal burden in this strain back-
ground (Fig 9C). In a CEA10 infection, both a pyrG+ strain and pyrG- strain had significant
levels of killing by 3 dpi and CFU counts from larvae infected with these strains were virtually
identical 5 dpi (Fig 9C). These data suggest that in wild-type larvae germination is not required
for fungal clearance, although we cannot rule out the possibility that pyrG-deficient spores do
eventually germinate at later time points in infection.
To determine the requirement for germination in neutrophil-mediated killing, we deter-
mined the effect of pyrG deficiency in the specific context of CEA10 killing in irf8-/- macro-
phage-deficient hosts (Fig 6A). In these larvae, neutrophils effectively clear ~85% of CEA10

spores and survival was monitored. Data represent 2 pooled experiments. Average injection CFUs: Af293 pyrG+ = 52,

pyrG+ fungal burden by 1 dpi (Fig 9D). However, a CEA10 pyrG- infection is cleared signifi-
cantly less in this context. At 3 dpi, there is no difference in pyrG- fungal clearance between
irf8-/- macrophage-deficient larvae and wild-type larvae. These data indicate that pyrG-defi-
cient CEA10 cannot be cleared by neutrophils, even in the absence of macrophages, suggesting
that neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 is dependent on germination. Together, these
data demonstrate that germination drives neutrophil-mediated killing of A. fumigatus, and
explain why a faster germinating strain is actually cleared more effectively by innate immune
cells than a slower-growing strain (Fig 10).
Discussion
Here we have used larval zebrafish to image Aspergillus fumigatus infection in live, intact hosts,
over the course of a multi-day infection to visualize and quantify both immune cell behavior
and fungal development and growth. Using a method to visually quantify spore killing, we
find that faster-growing CEA10-derived strains of A. fumigatus are cleared significantly better
than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. We report that clearance of CEA10-derived strains
Fig 10. Model of neutrophil and macrophage responses to Aspergillusfumigatus. Upon infection, A. fumigatus
spores are taken up by macrophages, which form dense clusters around the fungus and inhibit spore germination.
Macrophages provide a protective niche for spore survival, as neutrophil-mediated killing of A. fumigatus requires
germination. As a result, in infections with slow-germinating A. fumigatus strains, the fungus persists for days, while in
infections with fast-germinating A. fumigatus strains, germination drives neutrophil recruitment, neutrophil-mediated
killing, and faster fungal clearance. Macrophages have some anti-fungal activity, dependent on Myd88-NF-κB
signaling, however NF-κB activation is not sufficient to kill slow-germinating strains.

is primarily due to neutrophil function and is driven by fungal germination, whereas slower-
growing Af293-derived strains do not recruit as many neutrophils and therefore can persist in
the host for >5 days. Many fungal pathogens can survive within macrophages [40], but the
role of macrophages in vivo in A. fumigatus pathogenesis has remained ambiguous, and we
find that macrophages form tight clusters around injected spores. Macrophages inhibit spore
germination, and without spore germination, neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-medi-
ated killing are diminished, thus macrophages act as a protective niche against neutrophil-
mediated killing (Fig 10).
The phagocyte clusters that we observe are reminiscent of aspergillomas or “fungal granulo-
mas” that are found in lung or intracranial lesions of human patients [41, 42]. These macro-
phage-driven phagocyte clusters have never been observed before in an animal model of
Aspergillus infection, but phagocyte clustering is a common phenomenon in infections, with
the mycobacteria granuloma as the classic example [43]. We do find some neutrophils infiltrat-
ing into these clusters and neutrophil aggregates have been reported in response to both to
Aspergillus [12] and Candida [44]. Zebrafish larvae have been an ideal model in which to detect
phagocyte clusters, and they have been found in response to not just mycobacteria [45], but
also Streptococcus iniaie [46] and Mucor circinelloides [47].
In tuberculosis, granulomas can provide bacterial-protective functions [48] and macro-
phages can also act as protective niches for other pathogens [49]. In vivo, in larval zebrafish,
macrophages do not have much spore killing ability, in contrast to what has been found in
vitro [4, 5], but in line with some in vivo mouse experiments [6]. While in other mouse experi-
ments macrophage depletion led to an increase in A. fumigatus fungal burden [7], we hypothe-
size that the protective niche function of macrophages is only relevant at lower doses of spores,
not at the dose given in these experiments (~107). Our data suggest that the protective niche
function of macrophages arises simply by inhibition of fungal germination (Fig 10). While it is
also possible that macrophages actively repel neutrophils, as we have observed this behavior in
other inflammatory contexts [50], we cannot conclude this from the data presented here.
Neutrophils are highly efficient killers of A. fumigatus, and we find that this killing is largely
dependent on germination. Whether neutrophils respond directly to signals exposed on
hyphae or if epithelial cells and/or macrophages sense hyphae and recruit neutrophils in this
context is not known. In mice, the neutrophil response to CEA10 is dependent on IL-1α pro-
duction [27]. IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling requires the Myd88 adaptor protein, but our
experiments with myd88-/- larvae demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil
recruitment and killing in this context. The Card9 adaptor can also transduce fungal signals to
recruit neutrophils [34], and we hypothesize that this signaling is occurring in macrophage-
deficient larvae to recruit neutrophils. Interestingly, in mice, neutrophil recruitment to Af293
and CEA10 infections is driven by different pathways and signals, in agreement with the differ-
ences we observe in the ability of these strains to recruit neutrophils [27].
In addition to inducing neutrophil recruitment, germination likely also makes A. fumigatus
more susceptible to host killing mechanisms in vivo. In fact, we find that a slower-germinating
Af293-derived strain is not effectively killed by the host even in a co-infection with a faster-ger-
minating CEA10-derived strain. Hyphal growth and branching increases susceptibility to neu-
trophil-mediated killing in vitro [51], and it has long been thought that neutrophils are much
more effective killers against hyphae than conidia [52]. One immune mechanism that neutro-
phils use against hyphae is neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are observed in
infected mouse lung tissue containing hyphae [20, 53]. In the absence of macrophages and the
increased presence of hyphae we observed large masses of sudan black staining at the site of
infection that are reminiscent of NETs. Sudan black stains neutrophil granules, and therefore
these masses could be actual NETs, neutrophil degranulation, or simply massive neutrophil

recruitment. It is worth noting that in imaging neutrophils expressing a cytosolic fluorescent
protein recruited to the site of infection we could sometimes see a haziness in that channel sug-
gesting neutrophil lysis, but could not prove the origin of this signal.
Differences in virulence between Af293 and CEA10 are also observed in murine models of
Aspergillus infection. In a chemotherapeutic model of immunosuppression, infection with
either of these strains caused similar rates of host death [26], a situation that may be similar to
our dexamethasone-treated zebrafish larvae (Fig 2C). In a less immunosuppressed triamcino-
lone-treated mouse model, CEA10 is more virulent [26]. However, this increase in virulence is
thought to be a result of increased resistance to hypoxia, a hallmark of this model [26], while
we do not know the hypoxic state of our zebrafish immunosuppression models. Murine stud-
ies have correlated the increased growth and germination of CEA10 compared to Af293 with
increased tissue damage [27], but have also found that increased growth in vitro across multi-
ple environmental and clinical isolates correlates with increased host survival in the triamcino-
lone-treated mouse model [26], possibly consistent with our findings that increased growth
leads to increased host response and clearance mechanisms.
Between these strains of A. fumigatus, we have identified two different virulence mecha-
nisms, both of which are commonly observed in a variety of human pathogens. CEA10-der-
ived strains can germinate quickly in vivo, and therefore under neutrophil-deficient conditions
can cause disease and spread. On the other hand, Af293-derived strains do not germinate
quickly but instead can persist largely undetected in the host. This latter mechanism is similar
to one proposed for a different Aspergillus species, A. terreus [54], and for the fungal pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans [55]. These two different mechanisms highlight the contradiction
underlying Aspergillus pathogenesis: while germination is required for virulence, it simulta-
neously activates the immune system and immune mechanisms that can kill the fungus. These
ideas are relevant for the development and deployment of anti-Aspergillus treatments. Are
there particular host scenarios in which it is better to simply inhibit germination and allow
Aspergillus spores to persist? Or others where it is better to induce germination to activate host
immune responses? Drugs that target macrophages to both maintain their ability to inhibit
germination and increase neutrophil recruitment could provide the best possible scenario for
future immunotherapies. Future investigation of the mechanisms behind each of these macro-
phage behaviors will be required to further understand the molecules and pathways involved.

vector [60, 61] cut with KpnI/XbaI. ~90 pg of Tol2 plasmid was micro-injected with 75 pg of
transposase mRNA into embryos at the single cell stage. mRNA was in vitro transcribed
(mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit, Ambion) from a pCS2-transposase vector [62]. Larvae
were screened for BFP expression in neutrophils at 2–3 days post fertilization (dpf) and grown
up to establish a stable line.
Morpholino injections
Previously published and established splice-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (MO, Gen-
eTools) were re-suspended in water to a stock concentration of 1 mM. MOs were then diluted
in water with 0.5X CutSmart Buffer (NEB) and 0.1% phenol red and 3 nl was micro-injected
into single-cell stage embryos. Injected concentrations of morpholinos were 0.4 mM (irf8
(ZFIN MO1: aatgtttcgcttactttgaaaatgg)[63]), 0.5 mM (pu.1 (ZFIN MO1: gatatactgatactc-
cattggtggt)[64]), and 0.33 mM (myd88 (ZFIN MO2: gttaaacactgaccctgtggatcat)[65]). These
injected amounts of irf8 and pu.1 MO are standard and efficacy of knockdown was previously
confirmed [63, 64]. To confirm the splice-blocking effect of the myd88 morpholino at this con-
centration, RNA was isolated from individual larvae with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and
cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III RT and oligo-dT (Invitrogen). PCR was then per-
formed with GoTaq (Promega) and primers for myd88 (F: 5’-atggcatcaaagttaagtatagacc-3’, R:
5’-agggcagtgagagtgctttg-3’) and ef1a (F: 5’-tgccttcgtcccaatttcag-3’, R: 5’-taccctccttgcgctcaatc-3’)
[66]. Shifts in band size were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. For irf8 and myd88 MO
injections, a standard control MO (GeneTools) was used at a matching concentration.
Clodronate liposome injection
At 1.5 dpf, 2 nl of clodronate or PBS liposomes (Liposoma) with 0.1% phenol red was micro-
injected intravenously into the caudal vein plexus of transgenic larvae expressing a fluorescent
macrophage marker. Macrophage depletion was confirmed 24 hours later by loss of signal on
a fluorescent zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) prior to hindbrain
injection of A. fumigatus.
Aspergillusfumigatus growth and spore microinjection
All A. fumigatus strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. TBK4.1 was generated by trans-
forming TFYL44.1 with pJMP4, encoding the A. fumigatus argB gene [72]. TBK5.1 was gener-
ated from TBK4.1 by fusing mCherry to the 3’ end of A. fumigatus gpdA and inserting the
A. fumigatus pyrG gene, as described previously for YFP expression in TBK1.1 [21]. Spores
were grown at 37˚C on solid glucose minimal media (GMM) and prepared for injection as

described previously [21]. For pyrG1 auxotrophs, 5.2 mM uridine and 5 mM uracil were added
to GMM as supplements. Micro-injection of spore preparations into the hindbrain of 2 dpf lar-
vae was performed as previously described [21]. We aimed for an infectious dose of ~30 spores
per larvae. Actual spore injection doses were monitored by single larvae CFU platings on day 0
of infection as described below and are reported in figure legends for each experiment. Spores
were heat-killed by incubation at 99˚C for 30 min, with 300 rpm shaking. For survival and
CFU experiments, individual larvae were maintained in 96-well plates. For imaging analyses,
larvae were kept in 35 mm dishes or in 48-well plates.
CFU counts
Single larvae were placed in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes with 90 μl of 1x PBS containing
500 μg/ml Kanamycin and 500 μg/ml Gentamycin and homogenized in a mini bead beater at
maximum speed for 10–20 seconds. The entire volume was plated on a 10 cm GMM plate,
incubated for two days at 37˚C, and CFUs were counted. For each CFU experiment, 8 larvae
were individually plated for each time point and each condition. For co-infection CFU experi-
ments, fluorescence of colonies was visualized on a zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-
NeoFluar Z objective) to specifically count colonies of each strain. All CFU data were normal-
ized to the average initial injection dose for each replicate and condition.
Live-dead spore labeling
Spore cell walls were labeled with AlexaFluor molecules as previously described [10]. Briefly,
biotin-XX, SSE (Life Technologies) was conjugated to spores in 0.05 M NaHCO3. Spores were
washed in Tris-HCl pH 8 to deactivate free-floating biotin, then washed in PBS, and incubated
with streptavidin-AF594 or -AF633 (Life Technologies). Labeling was confirmed by fluores-
cence imaging and spores were resuspended in PBS and injected as described above.
Live imaging
To prevent pigment formation, 0.2 mM N-phenylthiourea (PTU, Sigma-Aldrich) was added
to E3 water 1 dpf. Larvae carrying fluorescent transgenes were pre-screened on a zoomscope
(EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) prior to the experiment. For daily imaging,
larvae were maintained in single wells of a 48-well plate. Each day, larvae were removed, one at
a time, anesthetized in E3 with Tricaine, and placed into zWEDGI chambers [73] to correctly
orient their hindbrains towards the bottom of the dish. Images were acquired on a spinning
disk confocal microscope (CSU-X; Yokogawa) with a confocal scanhead on a Zeiss Observer

Z.1 inverted microscope, Plan-Apochromat NA 0.8/20x objective, and a Photometrics Evolve
EMCCD camera. Images were acquired with ZEN software (Zeiss). After imaging was com-
plete, larvae were washed in E3 with PTU and placed back into the same plate well. To image
AlexaFluor-labeled spores, larvae were also imaged in zWEDGI chambers [73] on the same
spinning disk confocal microscope with an EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.75/40x objective. Clodro-
nate-injected larvae were also imaged with the spinning disk confocal with a EC Plan-Neofluar
NA 0.3/10x objective. To image GFP expression in the NF-κB RE:GFP line, 2 days post injec-
tion (dpi) larvae were mounted in a glass-bottom dish with 1% low-melting point agarose.
Images were acquired with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FluoView FV1000; Olym-
pus) with an NA 0.75/20x objective and FV10-ASW software (Olympus). To image mfap4:
tomato-caax larvae, larvae at 3 dpi (for macrophage cluster imaging) or 1 dpi (for co-infection
imaging) were mounted in agarose and imaged on the Olympus laser-scanning confocal
microscope as described above.
Image analysis/processing
In all displayed images, image histogram levels were adjusted in Fiji. For any experiments
where fluorescence intensity of images was quantified, no alteration was made to images
prior to analysis. To quantify killing of AlexaFluor-labeled spores (Fig 1B and 1C), alive and
killed spores were manually counted in Fiji. Displayed images of Alexa-Fluor labeled spores
were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold.
To quantify GFP signal from the NF-κB RE:GFP zebrafish line (Fig 2A and 2B), a single slice
from each z-stack representing the center of the hindbrain was isolated. In Fiji, the hind-
brain region was manually identified in the corresponding brightfield image and the mean
grey value as well as the integrated density (area × mean grey value) in that region in the
GFP channel was measured. Displayed images of GFP signal were also processed in Fiji with
bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. Signal intensity is displayed
with the 16 colors look up table. To quantify phagocyte recruitment and fungal growth
(Figs 4, 7 and 8), z-stacks and/or maximum intensity projections were analyzed in Fiji.
Cell numbers, phagocyte cluster area, and presence of germination and/or invasive hyphae
were scored manually. 2D fungal area was calculated by thresholding. Images of phagocyte
recruitment (Fig 4C) were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel
density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 0.75). Images in S1 Movie were pro-
cessed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a
gaussian blur (radius = 1). The displayed image of tomato+ clustered cells (Fig 4E) was pro-
cessed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density four-fold followed by
a gaussian blur (radius = 2). For co-infection imaging quantification (Fig 3), pair-wise dis-
tances between spores in each larvae were measured manually in Fiji. Displayed images of
co-infection were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density
two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 1). Whole larvae images of macrophages and
neutrophils after clodronate injection (S6A Fig) were manually assembled. Images of A.
fumigatus infected clodronate-depleted or control larvae (S7A Fig) were processed in Fiji
with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur
(radius = 0.75).
Drug treatments
Dexamethasone (Sigma) was resuspended to a stock concentration of 10 mM in 100% ethanol.
Larvae were treated with 10 μM dexamethasone, or equivalent ethanol control (0.1%) immedi-
ately after infection and the drug was left on larvae for the entirety of the experiment.

Withaferin A was resuspended in DMSO to a stock concentration of 10 mM. 2 hpi, E3 was
changed to E3 with 30 μM withaferin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or DMSO (0.3%). 24 hpi,
drug was removed and larvae were placed back in E3 alone.
Sudan black staining
Sudan black staining was performed as described in protocol dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.
io.rced2te. For visualization of sudan black staining (and YFP/GFP of injected fungus), larvae
were placed into zWEDGI wells [73] to correctly orient their hindbrains and imaged on a
spinning disk confocal microscope (CSU-X; Yokogawa) with a confocal scanhead on a Zeiss
Observer Z.1 inverted microscope, Plan-Apochromat NA 0.8/20x objective, a Photometrics
Evolve EMCCD camera, and ZEN software (Zeiss).
Calcofluor white staining
Larvae were anesthetized and placed on a glass slide. As much liquid as possible was removed,
5 μl of 1 g/L calcofluor white was pipetted on top of the larvae, and a glass coverslip was placed
on top. Smashed larvae were imaged for the presence of calcofluor-white stained hyphae
within 10 minutes on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope with a EC Plan-Neofluar NA
0.30/10x objective and epifluorescence images were taken with a Photometrics Coolsnap ES2
camera and ZEN software (Zeiss).
Statistical analyses
For all statistical analyses, three independent experiments were performed. Experimental Ns
are noted in figures and/or figure legends. For larval survival data and analysis of cumulative
germination and invasive hyphal occurrence in larvae, replicates were pooled and analysed by
Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, with experimental replicate included as a group
variable. In addition to pair-wise P values, this analysis also calculates hazard ratios, which are
sometimes displayed. The hazard ratio can be interpreted as the relative death rate and repre-
sents the relative instantaneous risk of death throughout the experiment between two condi-
tions. For quantification of imaging experiments (spore killing, intensity, cell counts, cluster
area, or fungal area) and for CFU quantification, pooled data from three replicates was com-
pared between experimental conditions using analysis of variance. Results are summarized in
terms of least-squared adjusted means (lsmeans) and standard error (SEM). In some cases,
graphs show both calculated lsmeans ± SEM and individual data points, color-coded by repli-
cate. For data in Fig 7B and 7D, representing percent of larvae per experiment over three
experiments, P values were calculated by t test and regular means ± SEM are displayed. Statisti-
cal analyses and graphical representations were done in R version 3.4, GraphPad Prism version
6, and/or Microsoft Excel 2016.
