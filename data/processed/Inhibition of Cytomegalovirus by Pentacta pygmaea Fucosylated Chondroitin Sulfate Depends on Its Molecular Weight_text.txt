Abstract: Many viruses attach to host cells by ﬁrst interacting with cell surface proteoglycans
containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with speciﬁc
receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new
fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin ﬁbroblasts were infected with
HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield
at ﬁve days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized
by labeling the puriﬁed virus particles with a self-quenching ﬂuorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18).
The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV speciﬁcally blocking virus
entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional
to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any signiﬁcant
cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In
conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a
key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can
be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.

1. Introduction
Betaherpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are common human
pathogens, yet only a small percentage of infected people experience acute illness [1]. In
people with impaired immune systems, HCMV-mediated infections can be life-threatening.
Despite signiﬁcant advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic management of the dis-
ease, HCMV poses a serious threat in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant
recipients as well as in acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome patients [2]. In addition,
HCMV infection in utero is the leading cause of congenital infection that can result in
developmental abnormalities, including sensorineural hearing loss, developmental delays,
and even fetal death [3–5].
There are currently no commercially available vaccines to prevent HCMV infection [6]
and only a small number of drugs, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet,
maribavir, and letermovir, have been Food and Drug Administration approved for the
treatment/prophylaxis of HCMV infection and disease [7,8]. Moreover, drug resistance is
increasingly common with circulating strains acquiring UL54 (polymerase) and/or UL97
(kinase) mutations that confer resistance to commonly available drugs [9–11]. Therefore,
the identiﬁcation of newer anti-HCMV drugs with improved efﬁcacy and novel modes of
action are essentially needed.
Heparan sulfate (HS) is present on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular
matrix of most mammalian tissues [12,13]. Numerous viruses including HCMV attach to

host cells by ﬁrst engaging with cell surface HS glycosaminoglycan chains, followed by
interaction with the speciﬁc protein receptors, which results in virus entry [14,15]. HCMV
can infect different types of cells and tissues indicating that it can engage with a wide
variety of host cell receptors to enter the cell and establish an infection [16–19]. Speciﬁc viral
glycoproteins engage these structurally and functionally distinct receptors that include
the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, cellular integrins, neuropilin-2, and
epidermal growth factor receptor [20–26].
Earlier, our group showed that HCMV preferentially binds to uniquely sulfated and
polymerized HS using its surface glycoprotein B (gB) [15]. HS mimetics, including heparin,
bind to gB and inhibit HCMV infection by competitively inhibiting virus attachment to the
cell surface [15,27]. Heparin is composed of disaccharide-repeating units (Figure 1A) and
is an efﬁcient anticoagulant; it can cause excessive bleeding and thrombocytopenia that
necessitate close patient observation and, if necessary, the administration of an antidote
(protamine) [28,29]. Two potential solutions to these anticoagulant side effects are using
either the naturally potent anti-viral sulfated glycans with lower anticoagulant properties
or the dissociation of the anticoagulant and anti-viral properties of the existing heparin.
We were able to provide instances of both in our earlier work [28,30,31]. In contrast to
heparin, a newly discovered fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FucCS) from the body wall
of the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) was found to have signiﬁcantly lower
anticoagulant activity but signiﬁcant antiviral efﬁcacy against severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [28]. The PpFucCS anticoagulant activity can be
further reduced by hydrolysis into oligosaccharide fractions [30].
In the current investigation, PpFucCS (Figure 1B) was used to target HS–virus interac-
tion and prevent HCMV entry into cells. We show that PpFucCS has signiﬁcant antiviral
activity against HCMV and that, when hydrolyzed into fractions, the oligosaccharides lose
their anti-HCMV activity in a size-dependent manner.

Figure 1. Structural representation of sulfated glycans assayed for anti-HCMV activity. (A) Unfrac-
tionated heparin (UFH) is mostly composed of repeating disaccharide units of [→4)-α-GlcN-(1→4)-
α-IdoA-(1→] where GlcN is glucosamine and IdoA is iduronic acid. Sulfation occurs frequently at
the N- and C6-positions of GlcN and C2 position of IdoA. (B) PpFucCS is constituted of a chondroitin
sulfate backbone that alternates N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) in
repeating disaccharide units of [→3)-β-GalNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcA-(1→], where the GalNAc units are
primarily 4-sulfated (80%) and, to a very less degree, 4,6-disulfated (10%) or nonsulfated (10%).
The GlcA units are replaced at the C3 position by three different forms of α-fucose (Fuc) branches:
Fuc2,4S-(1→(40%), Fuc2,4S-(1→4)-Fuc-(1→(30%), and Fuc4S-(1→(30%); where S = SO3−.

2. Materials and Methods
PpFucCS extraction and puriﬁcation: As previously reported [30], PpFucCS was re-
covered from the body wall of the sea cucumber P. pygmaea (Gulf Specimen Lab Gulf of Mex-
ico,
Florida
Keys)
by
performing
proteolytic
digestion
using
papain
(Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA). Using anion exchange chromatography, the dry crude extract was
fractionated on a 1.5 cm × 20 cm column packed with DEAE-Sephacel resin (Sigma). It
was then eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl in 0.1 M NaOAc at pH 6.0 from 0 M to
3 M with a ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL/min. 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue (DMB) reagent was
used to monitor each fraction. The polysaccharide fractions that were detected using the
DMB assay were combined, dialyzed three times against water, and then lyophilized to
concentrate for preservation and transportation. The dialyzed sugars were then subjected
to puriﬁcation using a Sephadex G15 (Sigma) column (1 cm × 30 cm) with water as the
mobile phase for cleanup. The lyophilization was performed to purify the sugar. To es-
timate the concentration of the samples in the various assays, dry weight measurements
were collected.
PpFucCS Depolymerization: PpFucCS was depolymerized using a modiﬁed Fenton
technique that has been demonstrated to be extremely selective for the breakage of GlcA
and GalNAc bonds found in the backbone of this class of polysaccharides [30]. A previously
described methodology that had been slightly changed was used to carry out the reaction;
40 mg of dry-weight PpFucCS was weighed and dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/mL
in 0.1 M sodium acetate at a pH of 6.0 to optimize the reaction conditions; 0.02 mM copper
(II) acetate (ﬁnal concentration) was then added to the dissolved polysaccharide solution.
The reaction was carried out for 180 min at 60 ◦C with constant stirring after the addition
of 200 mM H2O2 in drops to the reaction liquid. By removing the copper ions from the
reaction mixture using Chelex (50–100 mesh size) resin, the reaction was quenched by
adding Chelex resin that had been pre-equilibrated using 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH
6.0, and keeping it on an end-to-end rotor for 2 h at room temperature. The suspension was
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min after 2 h. The supernatant was lyophilized and desalted.
Fractionation of PpFucCS oligosaccharides: The dried depolymerized mixture of Pp-
FucCS was fractionated depending on the size in a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1.5 cm × 170 cm), at a
ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/15 min. A 10% ethanol solution containing 1.0 M NaCl was used to
fractionate the mixture. Hydrolyzed PpFucCS (HdPpFucCS) is native PpFucCS that has
been subjected to depolymerization The fractions obtained were assayed for the presence
of PpFucCS oligosaccharides using DMB. The eluted oligosaccharides were divided into
4 fractions (Fr1–Fr4) based on the DMB proﬁle and their corresponding retention times
on the Bio-Gel P-10 column. Before any analysis, all the fractions were desalted on the
Sephadex G-15 column and then lyophilized. See [30].
Distribution of PpFucCS oligosaccharides: Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
was used to analyze the oligosaccharide distribution of the depolymerized PpFucCS
fractions [30].
PpFucCS oligosaccharides structural integrity determination: The structural integrity of
the PpFucCS oligosaccharides produced was investigated using one-dimensional proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1D 1H NMR) spectroscopy [30].
Cells: The human foreskin ﬁbroblasts (HFF) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Corning, Manassas, VA, USA, catalog No. 10-013-CM) with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA, catalog
No. 10437-028), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Corning,
Manassas, VA, USA; catalog No. 30-002-CI) at 37 ◦C along with 5% CO2 [32].

Virus: HCMV (TowneBAC strain) tagged with a green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) [33]
was grown on the HFF cells. The virus stock was prepared in 3X autoclaved milk, son-
icated three times for 10 s with a 30 s gap, and stored at −80 ◦C. For the preparation of
the autoclaved milk, we dissolved Nestle Carnation instant nonfat dry milk powder in
nanopure water at neutral pH to obtain 10% milk [6,15,34], which was then autoclaved
three consecutive times before storage at 4 ◦C.
Virus infections: For infecting the HFFs, the media was removed from the wells of
the cell culture plates, washed with serum-free medium DMEM, and appropriately diluted
virus stock was absorbed on the cells in DMEM without serum. The cells were incubated for
1 h with gentle shaking every 10 min followed by washing thrice with serum-free DMEM.
Fresh complete DMEM was added, and the cells were incubated until the endpoint.
IC50 assay and percent inhibition calculation: To determine the half-maximal in-
hibitory concentration (IC50) of PpFucCS, its hydrolyzed form, and its fractions, the HFFs
were pretreated for 1 h with a range of concentrations (50 µg/mL, 25 µg/mL, 12.5 µg/mL,
6.25 µg/mL, 3.12 µg/mL, 1.56 µg/mL, and 0.78 µg/mL), UFH, or mock, and then infected
with HCMV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The cells were ﬁxed at 5 days
post-infection (dpi), and the number of GFP-positive cells for each concentration was
enumerated using the Cytation 5 automated microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). The experiment was repeated three times in order to conﬁrm the
reproducibility of the measurements. The data were normalized in GraphPad Prism 9.0,
using the number of GFP-positive cells in the mock wells as 0% inhibition and the number
‘0′ as 100% inhibition. The percentage (%) inhibition was plotted against the concentration
range. The relative IC50s were calculated using a ﬁxed top limit of the average vehicle-only
control and a ﬂoating bottom limit.
For virus yield reduction assays, the HFFs were pretreated for 1 h with a range of
concentrations (50 µg/mL, 25 µg/mL, 12.5 µg/mL, 6.25 µg/mL, 3.12 µg/mL, 1.56 µg/mL,
and 0.78 µg/mL), of PpFucCS and mock (in duplicates of two independent experiments),
and then infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3. The samples were harvested within the
medium at 5 dpi by scraping the cells and stored at −80 ◦C before titration. On the day
of titration, the harvested samples were sonicated three times for 10 s each with a 30 s
gap. The monolayers of the HFFs were grown in 12-well tissue culture plates, and serial
dilutions of the sonicated samples in the DMEM (without any additional compounds) were
absorbed onto them for 1 h (in duplicates), followed by washing thrice with serum-free
DMEM. For the viral titers, fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and gamma immunoglobulin
was added to the HFFs. At this step, no native PpFucCS was added to the overlayed
medium, and the cells were incubated for from 9 to 10 dpi. At the endpoint, the DMEM
overlay was removed, and the cells were washed 2X using PBS. The infected HFFs were
then ﬁxed in 100% methanol for 5 min. The HFFs were immediately stained using Modiﬁed
Giemsa stain (Sigma-Aldrich, Milli-pore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA, catalog No. GS1L)
for 15 minutes. the plates were then washed with tap water and air dried, and the dark
stained plaques were quantiﬁed.
Octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) labeling and entry assay: The appropriate amount of
virus was incubated using R18 (20 ng/L) (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Invitrogen, Waltham,
Massachusetts, USA, catalog No. O246) at 4 ◦C for 1 h. An equal volume of DMEM was
added and the tube was centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 ◦C to pellet the labeled
virus, which was resuspended in 200 µL of DMEM. The native PpFucCS (50 µg/mL) was
overlayed on the cells (HFF) for 1 h at 37 ◦C, and the plate was then incubated at 4 ◦C for
15 min. The puriﬁed virus, labeled with R18, was added to the plate and incubated for 1 h
at 4 ◦C with the pre-treated cells to allow for virus attachment. Thereafter, the unbound
virus was washed off using PBS and the plate was moved to 37 ◦C to allow for virus entry.
The plates were ﬁxed for staining with Hoechst dye at different time points after the 37 ◦C
move. The mock-treated cells with the labeled and unlabeled virus were used as controls.

Microscopy: The samples were prepared using the established protocols for ﬂuores-
cence microscopy. Brieﬂy, the HFF cells were grown on coverslip inserts in 24-well tissue
culture plates. The cells were pretreated using PpFucCS at 50 µg/mL concentration for
1 h and cooled at 4 ◦C for 15 min before infection using R18-labeled HCMV at a MOI of
3.0. The plate was then incubated at 37 ◦C along with 5% CO2 for 1 h. At the different
time points (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min) after the shift to 37 ◦C, the cells were ﬁxed
in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and incubated in 50 mM NH4Cl in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) for 10 min to reduce autoﬂuorescence and washed using 2X PBS. Finally, the
cells were incubated in Hoechst solution (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA,
Catalog No. 33342) in PBS (1:3000) for 10 min to stain the nucleus, followed by a PBS wash.
The coverslips were retrieved from the wells and were mounted on glass slides with a
drop of mounting medium (2.5% DABCO in Fluoromont G) and air dried for two hours
before imaging. The images were acquired on an EVOS-FL epiﬂuorescent microscope
(ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA).
Cell viability: The HFFs were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and grown to
conﬂuency (in triplicates). The cells were pretreated for 1 h with the highest concentration of
test compounds and controls and then infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3.0 or mock infected.
The medium was removed at 5 dpi, and the HFFs were harvested using trypsinization.
The cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion using a TC20 automated cell
counter (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The test was also performed using the native PpFucCS at 500 µg/mL via the trypan blue
exclusion assay along with the ATP release assay. We performed the bioluminescent
ATP assay by overlaying the compounds for ﬁve days on the conﬂuent HFF in an opaque-
walled 96-well tissue culture plate with blank controls using a CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability
Assay kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA, Catalog No. G9242) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The ATP luminescence was measured using a Cytation 7
automated microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) with the Endpoint/Kinetic read type
using a single wavelength with the appropriate gain. The viability experiments were
repeated two times to conﬁrm the measurements.
Statistics: The data were plotted in Graphpad Prism (Version 9.0, GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com, accessed on 3 March 2023). The standard
error of the mean was plotted as error bars. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant. An asterisk (*) denotes a signiﬁcant inhibition compared to the mock. The data
were evaluated using one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism 9.0 for multiple comparisons,
and the differences between the groups were considered signiﬁcant at a p-value of less
than 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Inhibition of HCMV by PpFucCS and Its Fractions
Here, we investigated the inhibitory activity of both native PpFucCS and its LMW
fractions against HCMV. The LMW PpFucCS oligosaccharides studied here were used
to establish a structural activity relationship and the inﬂuence of MW distribution on its
anti-viral activity against HCMV.
The native PpFucCS exhibited potent and efficacious inhibitory activity against HCMV
while the PpFucCS fractions showed decreased activity in both potency and efficacy (Figure 2A).
Comparing the mean inhibition at the highest concentration used (50 µg/mL), we show
that the efﬁcacy of native PpFucCS along with the unfractionated but hydrolyzed PpFucCS
oligosaccharide mixture (HdPpFucCS) and Fr1 was comparable to UFH, but it was signiﬁ-
cantly lower in the case of Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 (Figure 2B). Additionally, the native PpFucCS
had the least half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value amongst all the tests and
was comparable to that of UFH (Table 1). Thus, based on the comparison of low MW
PpFucCS products, it is evident that HdPpFucCS and Fr1 maintain better antiviral activity
than Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 while displaying only slightly less activity than native PpFucCS
and UFH. Earlier, our 1D 1H NMR spectra showed the presence of four fucose units in

Viruses 2023, 15, 859
6 of 12
Fr1–Fr3 that were similar to the native PpFucCS structure: α- Fuc2,4S, α-Fuc2,4S, α-Fuc4S,
and α-Fuc0S [30]. This indicates that, although Fr1–Fr3 differ in size, they have similar
structures. The Fuc anomeric peaks in fraction 4 showed an upﬁeld 1H shift, which may
indicate desulfation. Interestingly, the Fenton chemistry demonstrated a preserved struc-
tural integrity of the native PpFucCS in the majority of the oligosaccharides produced
(Fr1–Fr3), and only a small percentage of the very low MW (Fr4) showed more chemical
modiﬁcations [30]. Combining these recently published results with the current results, it is
evident that PpFucCS oligosaccharides lose their anti-HCMV activity in a size-dependent
manner and that structural features play a crucial role in their anti-viral activity.
To study the inhibition of progeny virion formation and virus growth, we performed
a virus yield reduction assay (at MOI 3.0). The IC50 obtained by performing this assay
(2.957 µg/mL) (Figure S1) is very close to the IC50 (3.6 µg/mL) determined by the GFP
reduction assay conducted at a low MOI (0.01) (Table 1), thus indicating that the inhibitory
properties of PpFucCS against HCMV do not depend on the MOI.

for their potential to inhibit the HCMV (GFP-tagged TowneBAC strain) infection in HFFs (MOI
0.1) by enumerating the cells expressing GFP. (A) Normalized values from the assay were analyzed
by nonlinear regression to ﬁt a dose–response curve using the least squares method considering
each repeated measure as an individual point. The plotted curve shows the percentage of HCMV
inhibition in a (log) concentration-dependent manner. Curves in the plot represent the following:
PpFucCS (red), HdPpFucCS (green), Fr1 (navy), Fr2 (purple), Fr3 (blue), Fr4 (brown), and UFH (black).
(B) Using the normalized values from the same assay, we calculated the percentage inhibition at the
maximum concentration used (Imax) and compared with the UFH at the same concentration (50
µg/mL) by performing one-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons by comparing the means
of each test with control UFH, and corrected using a Dunnett’s post hoc test, showing signiﬁcant
differences among the means. The results are representative of three independent experiments. The
standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. The ***, **, and ns (non-signiﬁcant) indicate
p-value < 0.001, from 0.001 to 0.01, and ≥0.05, respectively.

3.2. PpFucCS Speciﬁcally Inhibits HCMV Entry into Cells
To assess whether PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells (HFFs), we utilized
the TowneBAC strain of the HCMV labeled with a self-quenching ﬂuorescent label (R18
ﬂuorescence assay). The ﬂuorescence was recorded at different time intervals starting from
0 to 60 min post infection (Figure 3). The R18 dye transitions from one monolayer of a
ﬂuid-state phospholipid bilayer membrane to another in a potential-dependent manner,
somewhat relieving the quenching of its ﬂuorescence [35]. The ﬂuorescence from the HCMV
virus particles that have been labeled with high quantities of R18 is highly self-quenched
and their fusion with the host cell membrane leads to an increase in ﬂuorescence, which is
often visible only after the virus has entered the cell. A signiﬁcantly higher number of virus
particles entered the mock-treated cells compared to the cells treated with native PpFucCS
at 60 min post infection (Figure 3A,B).

number of ﬂuorescent virus particles were enumerated at different time points post infection and
plotted in Graphpad Prism 9. The HFFs were either mock treated and infected with the unlabeled

or PpFucCS-treated and infected with the R18 labeled virus at ‘0′ min (d), ‘5′ min (e), ‘10′ min (f), ‘20′

mean was plotted as error bars. The ***, and ns indicate p-value < 0.001, and ≥0.05, respectively.
3.3. Effect of PpFucCS and Its Oligosaccharides Treatment on Cell Viability
PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides do not exhibit any signiﬁcant cytotoxicity against
primary HFF cells when examined at the highest concentration used in the antiviral assay
(50 µg/mL) (Figure 4A) and show a protective effect against virus-induced cell death at
ﬁve days post infection (Figure 4B) when examined using a trypan blue exclusion assay.
Notably, the Fr3 and Fr4 that did not show any signiﬁcant antiviral activity (Figure 2) also
did not show any signiﬁcant protection from virus-induced cell death. Furthermore, we

Viruses 2023, 15, 859

did not see any cytotoxic effect on the HFFs when treated with the native PpFucCS at
500 µg/mL for ﬁve days using the trypan blue exclusion assay (Figure S2). To corroborate
these ﬁndings, we treated the HFFs with the native PpFucCS at 500 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL
along with heparin control for ﬁve days and performed the ATP release assay (Figure S3).

were either mock infected (A) or infected with HCMV at a MOI of 3.0 (B) in the presence of test
compounds. Cells were harvested at 5 days post-infection and cell viability was assessed using a
trypan blue exclusion assay. The results are representative of two independent experiments. The
standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars. The **, *, and ns indicate p-value between 0.001
and 0.01, between 0.01 and 0.05, and ≥0.05, respectively.
4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that PpFucCS and its hydrolyzed fractions efﬁciently
inhibit the HCMV infection of primary human ﬁbroblasts, speciﬁcally blocking virus entry
into the cells. The treatment of HFFs with native PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides did
not affect the cell viability for the duration of treatment, thus conﬁrming that the observed
reduction in the virus titer was not because of cytotoxicity. Moreover, when the HFFs were
pretreated and maintained in these marine glycans throughout the course of infection, the
cells resisted infection-induced cell death. To conﬁrm that PpFucCS has a direct impact on
virus entry, we used HCMV labeled with self-quenching dye that only ﬂuoresces when
the virus fuses with the cell membrane. This experiment showed the signiﬁcant effect of
PpFucCS on HCMV entry.
GAGs are composed of repeating disaccharide units that contain an amino sugar (either
GalNAc or GlcNAc) and a uronic acid (either IdoA or GlcA) or the neutral sugar galactose.
GAGs have a variety of biological functions, including cell signaling, proliferation, and
wound healing, as a result of their structural diversity, and are ubiquitously found on
the surface of cells, where they act as receptors and signals for cellular and pathogenic
processes [36]. Viruses or other pathogens utilize this structural diversity of GAGs to
selectively bind and enter the cells [37]. The virion attachment caused by GAG binding
and eventual entry are usually independent events, with attachment assumed to be mostly
nonspeciﬁc and charge-dependent but, instead, entry is thought to be driven by highly
speciﬁc protein–protein interactions. We have recently shown that HS–virus interactions are
speciﬁc and depend on a deﬁned structural functional relationship [12,15,28]. Interactions
with HS are a frequent prerequisite for many viral infections [38,39]. As a result, inhibitors
targeting virus–HS interactions have the potential to function as broad-spectrum antivirals
that could have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on global health.

Many compounds including small organic and inorganic compounds, as well as
polycationic peptides, have been employed to bind to HS and thereby protect the cells
from viral attachment [40–43]. Conversely, inhibitors may bind to virion components to
sequester and inactivate the virions very similarly to neutralizing antibodies [44]. These are
mostly HS mimetics, and many of them have broad-spectrum antiviral action. In this study,
we investigated the anti-HMCV activities of two GAGs: (i) heparin, a highly sulfated linear
GAG widely exploited as in research [45], and (ii) PpFucCS, a unique marine branched
GAG. From our results, we were able to compare the anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS
and its LWW fractions with the commonly used control heparin. Since the use of heparin
can lead to excessive bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, PpFucCS offers a
reasonable alternative to be developed as an antiviral.
The inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their
chain lengths. The native high MW structure is necessary to achieve maximum HMCV
inhibition. Upon hydrolysis (depolymerization) to generate the oligosaccharide mixture
(HdPpFuCS), the activity was considerably decreased. However, Fr1 had more anti-HMCV
activity compared to HdPpFucCS, most likely because HdPpFucCS has signiﬁcant amounts
of less active components (Fr2–Fr4: nearly 3/4 of the amount). Moreover, Fr4 has a
degraded structure. All the PpFucCS fractions (Fr1–Fr3) show the same 1D 1H NMR
spectral proﬁle as the native, therefore indicating they have the same structure [30]. The
only exception is Fr4, which was spectrally different and structurally degraded.
We recently observed a similar behavior of MW dependence on anticoagulation and
anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions of PpFucCS [30]. However, for the sulfated galactan from the
red alga Botryocladia occidentalis (BoSG), the reduction in the chain length was able to
dissociate the anticoagulant and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities [31]. The results from this
current work support the ﬁrst case, in which the high MW of the marine sulfated glycan, in
this case PpFucCS, is a key element for the biological activity. The current results regarding
the anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS perfectly match our recent ﬁndings regarding the
anticoagulation and anti-SARS-CoV-2 action of PpFucCS [30].
5. Conclusions
The current results demonstrate the antiviral activities of marine sulfated glycan Pp-
FucCS against HCMV, which is an enveloped DNA virus. Earlier, our group successfully
used a copper-based Fenton approach for the free-radical depolymerization of PpFucCS to
produce oligosaccharides with shorter chain lengths but preserved the structural integrity,
so it was similar to the native PpFucCS [30]. Our ﬁndings imply that a native PpFucCS
structure with a large MW is essential for achieving the greatest anti-HCMV activity. The
retained effective inhibitory potential of high MW structures derived from PpFucCS sug-
gests this marine glycan is a promising candidate for further evaluation and development
as a potential antiviral.
