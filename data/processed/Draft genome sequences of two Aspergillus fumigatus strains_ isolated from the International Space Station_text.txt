Draft genome sequences of Aspergillus fumigatus strains (ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4), opportunistic pathogens isolated from the
International Space Station (ISS), were assembled to facilitate investigations of the nature of the virulence characteristics of the
ISS strains to other clinical strains isolated on Earth.

F
ungi are a source of natural products that are useful to human-
kind. A variety of bioactive compounds produced by fungi are
used in pharmaceutical and food industries, agriculture, and be-
yond. However, some fungi are plant, animal, and human patho-
gens. Fungal pathogens could cause serious health complications
in immunocompromised populations. Pathogenic fungi can pro-
duce a range of secondary metabolites (SMs) that inﬂuence their
virulence (melanins, siderophores, species-speciﬁc toxins) and
immunologic potential.
Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic, ﬁlamentous fungus that
is ubiquitous outdoors (soil, decaying vegetation) and indoors
(hospitals, simulated closed habitats, etc.). Aspergillus fumigatus
can adapt to various environmental conditions and form airborne
conidia that are the inoculum for a variety of diseases (e.g., non-
invasive and invasive pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopul-
monary aspergillosis, etc.) in immunocompromised hosts.
In on-going microbial observatory experiments on the Inter-
national Space Station (ISS), molecular phylogeny and radiation
resistance of several fungal isolates were characterized. Two Asper-
gillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, were isolated
from a HEPA ﬁlter (1) and cupola wall (unpublished) of the ISS.
Because A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen causing pathol-
ogies ranging from allergic asthma to invasive aspergillosis, we
assessed several pathogenic characteristics of the ISS isolates in
comparison to two experimentally established clinical isolates,
Af293 (2) and CEA10 (3). Virulence assessment in a larval ze-
braﬁsh model of invasive aspergillosis revealed both ISSFT-021
and IF1SW-F4 as signiﬁcantly more lethal compared to both clin-
ical isolates (Af293 and CEA10) (4). In addition, the ISS strains
ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 exhibited signiﬁcantly greater resis-
tance to UV254 doses when compared to clinical isolates (4, 5).
The genomics of these ISS isolates might reveal the molecular
mechanisms of the increased virulence. Subsequently, if the en-
hanced virulence is attributed to the microgravity, NASA poten-
tially should consider developing countermeasures to protect the
health of astronauts, whose immune systems are reported to be
compromised under microgravity (6).
In this study, we determined the draft genome sequences of
A. fumigatus strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4. Whole-genome
shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500
instrument with a paired-end module. A total of 27,987,752 and
10,752,032 paired-end reads of 101-nucleotides were collected
for ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4. The NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (7) was
used to ﬁlter the data for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-
free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%;
cutoff quality score, 20). A total of 25,515,334 (~230 coverage)
for ISSFT-021 and 8,466,430 (~75 coverage) for IF1SW-F4
high-quality vector-ﬁltered reads were used for assembly with
MaSuRCA (8) genome assembler (k-mer size  70). The ﬁnal
assembly of the strain ISSFT-021 contains 301 scaffolds with a
total size of 28,526,023 bp and an N50 contig length of 275.468 kb;
the largest contigs assembled measures 813.103 kb and the GC%
was 49.41. Similarly, the ﬁnal assembly of the IF1SW-F4 strain
contains 208 scaffolds with a total size of 28,240,437 bp and an N50
contig length of 367.421 kb; the largest contig assembled measures
900.278 kb and the GC content was 49.45%.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The whole-genome
sequences of both the strains were deposited at DDBL/EMBL/
GenBank under the accession numbers LWRT00000000 and
LWRU00000000. The versions described in this paper are
LWRT01000000 and LWRU01000000. These A. fumigatus strains
were also deposited in the USDA Agricultural Research Station
and DSMZ public culture collections.
