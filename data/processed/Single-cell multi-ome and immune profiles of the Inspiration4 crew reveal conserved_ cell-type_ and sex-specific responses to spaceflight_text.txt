Single-cell multi-ome and immune proﬁles
of the Inspiration4 crew reveal conserved,
cell-type, and sex-speciﬁc responses to
spaceﬂight
A list of authors and their afﬁliations appears at the end of the paper
Spaceﬂight induces an immune response in astronauts. To better characterize
this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), bio-
chemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew.
We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inﬂammation, aging, and
muscle homeostasis changed after spaceﬂight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics
data, we identiﬁed a “spaceﬂight signature” of gene expression characterized
by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function,
and TCF21 pathways. We conﬁrmed the presence of this signature in inde-
pendent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial tran-
scriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we
observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I
genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune
pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study
reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a
roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health.
Human spaceﬂight exposes individuals and their immune systems to
unique environmental factors, including microgravity, ﬂuid shifts, and
radiation1,2. Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space;
studies on some crew members have shown signiﬁcant immune stress
related to spaceﬂight3. Given that more individuals with diverse phy-
sical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into space—and that
many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn,
Axiom)—an urgent goal of aerospace medicine is to understand better
how the immune system responds to and recovers from spaceﬂight for
the broader civilian population. Moreover, such proﬁles of cellular and
molecular changes in commercial crews can guide personalized
countermeasures for the missions and eventually lead to better crew
performance and safety4.
Immune-related clinical symptoms from spaceﬂight are prevalent
among astronauts and span many phenotypes, including inﬂamma-
tion, infection, and viral reactivation5,6. Indeed, clinical symptoms
associated with immune dysregulation were reported with 3.4 events
per ﬂight year, representing 46% of crew members6. While these
ﬁndings show that the spaceﬂight environment affects the human
immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and
mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies. Also,
since spaceﬂight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-
related disease (e.g., bone density and muscle loss)7, a better char-
acterization of immune system changes during the extreme physio-
logical stressor of spaceﬂight can offer insights into immune
dysregulation and functional deterioration on Earth.
Multi-omic studies provide unique advantages for understanding
biological changes, including spaceﬂight-associated immune system
alterations. For example, the NASA Twins Study used gene expression to
investigate immune changes stemming from a year-long mission, and
found unprecedented levels of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10, and gene
expression changes in both B-cells and T-cells7–9. However, a major
limitation of that study was the sample size, as it involved only one
ﬂight subject. It additionally used a bulk-cell analysis for most of the

transcriptome (preventing observations at a single-cell resolution) and
lacked a chromatin analysis using assays for transposase-accessible
chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data8,9, which is critical for under-
standing changes in genome regulation and long-term stress response.
Thus, a high-resolution map of the immune system’s response to
spaceﬂight is still needed. With these needs in mind, we report here
ﬁndings on the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, an all civilian-crewed
commercial
orbital
spaceﬂight,
including
multi-omic,
in-depth
immune system proﬁling at the single-cell level for the four-member
crew with a broad age range (29-50 years old at launch) and biomedical
backgrounds. We longitudinally analyzed single-nucleus gene expres-
sion (snRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq), and single-
cell T/B cell antigen receptor sequences from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, we integrated this multi-
omics data with a clinical proﬁle of a complete blood count (CBC), a
comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and cytokine/chemokine/
growth factor/metabolite measures. We also proﬁled cell frequencies
by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), biochemical proﬁling,
differential gene/peak expression, enriched biological pathways, over-
represented transcription factor binding site (TFBS), antibody isotype,
mutation proﬁles of BCR/TCR, cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma, and
association with skin, oral, and nasal microbiome changes. Here, we
provide a detailed report of these ﬁndings, illustrating a unique set of
immune system changes induced by high-elevation spaceﬂight, and
conclude with potential countermeasures derived from these data, all
of which can guide and inform future studies and missions.
Results
Immune-metabolic changes after spaceﬂight and recovery
To characterize the immune and metabolic changes induced by
spaceﬂight, we collected serum and whole blood from the crew before
and after the spaceﬂight (Fig. 1a) and ﬁrst performed CBC and CMP
assays to measure cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and meta-
bolites. The crew’s baseline values (pre-ﬂight) were compared to those
obtained 24 h after returning to Earth (R + 1) and post-ﬂight (R + 45, 82,
194), which revealed a set of cytokines with signiﬁcant increase (n = 13)
(Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b, Wilcoxon-rank sum test, adjusted
p value < 0.05) and a smaller set (n = 5) of molecules with a signiﬁcant
decrease (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b, Wilcoxon-rank sum test, adjusted
p value < 0.05). The IL-6, IL-10, CRP, and MCP-1 increases were con-
sistent with changes observed in other astronauts following long
duration (3–6-month or 12-month duration) missions (Supplementary
Fig. 1c)7–10. Moreover, several other pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (TNFα,
IL-27, CRP) and chemokines (IP-10, ENA-78, Fractalkine) were also
signiﬁcantly up-regulated at R + 1 (Fig. 1b). Although IL-6 and TNFα
are well-known pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, acute phase reactants like
ﬁbrinogen, hemoglobin, and SAP levels did not signiﬁcantly change
(Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating that the immune reaction was not
pervasive, and no other signiﬁcant changes were observed in the basic
metabolic blood panel (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
These data suggest that a high elevation, 3-day spaceﬂight
is sufﬁcient to induce the production of some established spaceﬂight
cytokine signatures (e.g., IL-6, IL-10) as well as previously undocu-
mented, responsive cytokines (e.g., ENA-78). These proteins have
critical
roles
in
immune
response,
muscle
homeostasis,
and
hematopoiesis8, but are not normally associated with systemic
inﬂammation (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Moreover, some cytokines (e.g.,
IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-1RA, and Fractalkine) are considered exerkines,
cytokines produced by the muscle and other tissues during exercise.
As such, we then examined if muscle tissues could be the source of
these immune markers. Signiﬁcant increases in some myokines (IL-4,
IL-5, and IL-7) were indeed observed, further supporting muscles as a
possible source (Fig. 1b) of these molecules, and indicating a physio-
logical response to microgravity rather than a purely inﬂammatory
response8.
We next mined RNA-sequencing data from dissected, space-ﬂown
mouse tissues to assess a possible tissue-of-origin for the circulating
cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 2a). While non-muscle tissues (e.g.,
mandibular bone, brown and white adipose tissues) did not show
changes in IL-6 or IL-10, (Supplementary Fig. 2b, d), the soleus showed
a signiﬁcant increase in the chemokine Ccl2/Mcp-1 (padj < 0.05,
logFC > 1), which is a chemokine associated with muscle exertion.
These samples also showed high CD68 expression, a surface marker
highly expressed in differentiating (M0) macrophages (Supplementary
Fig. 2e–h). Also, the tibialis anterior muscle showed an increase in
interleukins, with the largest increase upon landing for the pro-
inﬂammatory cytokine IL-5 (log2FC = 2.3, p value < 0.05) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2i), further suggesting muscles as a potential source for the
cytokines found in the I4 crew.
A spaceﬂight gene expression signature in Inspiration4
astronauts
PBMCs were used to generate single-nuclei gene expression (GEX) and
ATAC data (Fig. 1a, b, Fig. 2). We combined GEX and ATAC analysis of
PBMCs across 151,411 nuclei (ﬁltered with minimum of 200 genes,
maximum of 4500 gene counts, maximum of 20% mitochondrial
reads, maximum of 100,000 peak counts, maximum of 2 nucleosome
signal, and minimum of TSS enrichment per cell) by adapting the
multi-omic pipeline reported11, spanning 9 immune cell types: CD4
T cells, CD8 T cells, other T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD14
monocytes, CD16 monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and all remaining
cells (“other”) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). We validated the expression of
markers speciﬁc for each subpopulation in annotated PBMC sub-
populations based on reference expression for each cell type (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3a), quantiﬁed the distribution of cell populations
(Supplementary Fig. 3b) and conﬁrmed that overall cell proportions
were stable across spaceﬂight in the combined single-nuclei multi-ome
and FACS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3c–e) and CBC data (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3f), and mapped principal component analysis (PCA)
clustering of GEX and ATAC data across the timepoints (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4, 5).
Next, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially
accessible regions (DARs) (padj <0.05, |log2FC | > 0.25) were calculated
from the snRNA-seq snATAC-seq data, respectively, comparing
immediate (R + 1) and post-ﬂight differences (R + 45, R + 82) relative to
pre-ﬂight levels (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The number of DEGs and
DARs were highest at R + 1, but decreased for subsequent timepoints
among PBMCs, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 6b). However, a wide range of responses to spaceﬂight was
observed, with some cell types more affected than others. For exam-
ple, CD14 monocytes showed the highest number of DARs and DEGs at
R + 1, yet CD4 T and CD8 T cells were the least perturbed (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6b–c). Notably, chromatin accessibility responses to
spaceﬂight exhibited even greater cell type-speciﬁcity (Supplementary
Fig. 6b, c) than DEGs, with the most changes still appearing at R + 1. In
addition to the cell-speciﬁc responses to spaceﬂight, a core set of pan-
cellular gene expression changes was observed at R + 1. Speciﬁcally, a
set of 144 consistent DEGs was observed across all nine cell types
(Supplementary Fig. 6c).
PBMCs DEGs were signiﬁcantly conserved in I4 immune cells
(Supplementary Fig. 6d), thus, we used the PBMCs DEGs as the
“spaceﬂight signatures of the I4 astronauts” for further analysis. Given
this spaceﬂight signature set of genes, we then examined the enriched
pathways using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which showed
enrichment of ribosomal translation, oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), mitochondrial metabolism, UV response, TCF21 targets,
mitotic spindle, and immune pathways (padj < 0.05) (Fig. 1c). Addi-
tionally, we conﬁrmed that the GSEA result was conserved across all I4
immune cell sub-types (Fig. 1d). We cross-validated the GSEA ﬁndings
with over-representation analysis through Gene Ontology pathways of

these DEGs, which also showed down-regulated DEGs were enriched
(padj < 0.05) in ribosomal translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and
mitochondrial metabolism (Supplementary Data. 1). Up-regulated
DEGs were signiﬁcantly enriched in response to stimulus, signaling,
and metabolism (Supplementary Data. 1). Moreover, Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) also showed inhibition of oxidative phosphor-
ylation and translation (EIF2 signaling) pathways and activation of
mitochondrial dysfunction across cell types (Supplementary Data 2).
Also, the core set of altered regions of chromatin (DARs) on R + 1
included over-represented motifs for SPIB, SPI1, CEBPD, SPIC, EHF,
CEBPA, ELF3, IKZF1, EWSR1-FLI1, FOSL2, and KLF4 (Fig. 1e, Supple-
mentary Fig. 6e, Supplementary Data 3). Their normalized motif
activity score (chromVAR deviation z-scores of TF motifs) were
increased at R + 1 and recovered over time (Fig. 1e). Of note, while

CEBPA12, EHF13, SMAD14, EWSR1-FLI115, c-Fos16, and TCF2117,18 have been
implicated in spaceﬂight before, the others have not been previously
described in astronauts.
Cell subpopulation changes after 3-day spaceﬂight and recovery
To better understand spaceﬂight’s impact on each cell type, we
examined the cell proﬁles with more granular sub-typing (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7a–d), mutation rates in B cells and T cells (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7e–h) and used single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) on the DEGs for
each immune cell population (Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary
Data 4). First, overall cell proportions of granular annotation were
stable across spaceﬂight (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). Second, we found
that the TCR V(D)J repertoire from L-3 to R + 82 was stable in terms of
mutations (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f). Conversely, the total number of
BCR mutations increases relative to pre-ﬂight at R + 1 (64.6 vs 61.6) and
R + 45 (65.5 vs 61.6) (Supplementary Fig. 7g, h). Moreover, we found
that cell differentiation and cell proliferation pathway scores were
decreased (around 5–10%) at R + 1 for both CD4 T and CD8 T cells,
which mirrors the T cell suppression previously observed in simulated
GCR
irradiation19,
simulated
microgravity20,
and
Space
Shuttle
missions21 (Supplementary Data 4). Similarly, the CD4 central memory
T cell (CD4 TCM) differentiation pathway and memory T cell activation
scores were decreased in CD4 effector memory T cells (CD4 TEM) and
CD8 central memory T cells (CD8 TCM) at R + 1. However, monocytes
and DCs showed more mixed phenotypes, with activation, differ-
entiation, aggregation, and extravasation scores all dysregulated at
R + 1. These ﬁndings are consistent with previous reports of changes in
phagocytic capacity, degranulation, and cytokine production for
DC22,23 (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Upon return to Earth, the astronauts’ serum showed higher con-
centrations of cytokines associated with inﬂammation, such as IL-6,
TNF-α, APR (acute phase reactants), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
(Fig. 1b). These changes were concomitant with an increase in cyto-
kines with anti-inﬂammatory activity, such as IL-1ra, IL-10, and cyto-
kines linked to a Th2 proﬁle (IL-4 and IL-5) (Fig. 1b), which likely
balances the inﬂammation from returning to Earth. However, the Th1-,
Th2-, and Th17-secreted cytokines in CD4 TCM subset24–28 showed no
signiﬁcant changes (Supplementary Fig. 9a); GSEA analysis of Th1, Th2,
and Th17 cell pathways conﬁrmed no signiﬁcant changes (Supple-
mentaryFig. 9b, padj > 0.05), further indicating the cell-type speciﬁcity
of these responses. Interestingly, signiﬁcant changes were also
observed in chemokines related to the migration of monocytes
(increased MCP-1, decreased MIP-1α, and MCP-2/4) and neutrophils
(higher IP-10 and ENA-78) (Fig. 1b).
To examine the cellular impact of these cytokine changes, we
mapped known vs. novel pathways associated with spaceﬂight7, as
well as TF accessibility and the cell-type speciﬁcity of these respon-
ses. Of note, the CD16 monocytes showed the highest number of
enriched, known pathways (Supplementary Fig. 9c), and CD14
monocytes showed the longest persistence of these changes, indi-
cating a slower recovery after spaceﬂight. We then used the DARs’
chromatin accessibility data to compare over-represented TF motifs
at R + 1 (Supplementary Data 3), and intersected these TFs with the
literature. For the top 12 motifs from T cells, a novel set of
spaceﬂight-responsive TFs was identiﬁed (KFL16, ETV1, ZNF148,
RREB1, GABPA, KLF9), as well as some known, including MAZ29,
Wt130,31, KLF413, and KLF532. For B cells, novel TFs included SPIB,
ZKSCAN5, IKZF1, and EBF3, while previously identiﬁed TFs included
STAT33, IRF134, EHF13, and Arid3a18. Interestingly, these TFs are all key
to B cell function: STATs mediate cytokine responses (IL735, B cell
differentiation, and control of the germinal center reaction36,37); SPIB
regulates the expression of the B cell receptor, CD40L, BAFF, and TLR
ligands38, and IKZF1 is a transcription factor essential for B cell acti-
vation, maturation, and differentiation39. For monocytes and DCs,
novel TFs included SPIB, SPIC, HLF, IKZF1, ELF3, CTCFL, and
ZKSCAN5, and known TFs included CEBPD40, STAT140, CTCF41, EHF13,
Arid3a18, and IRF134. Finally, we observed that the motif activity scores
of CD14 monocytes and DCs recovered more slowly than CD16
monocytes, taking until the last time point to recover (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 9d), further evidence that the CD14 population was the
slowest to recover from spaceﬂight.
Conserved responses from other missions and possible
countermeasures
To further validate and contextualize the I4 spaceﬂight signature, we
next compared differential genes and pathways to several other data
sets, including gene expression data in NASA’s GeneLab database, the
NASA Twins Study7, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomomes42, I4 plasma
cfRNA, I4 EVP and plasma proteomics43, the JAXA cfRNA study, and
microgravity-simulated PBMCs44. First, we analyzed 27 murine datasets
from GeneLab (n = 817 samples) for spaceﬂight-speciﬁc DEGs, and
found 2184 total DEGs (1288 upregulated and 896 downregulated)
(Fig. 2a) common across the 27 datasets (Supplementary Data 5). When
comparing orthologous genes to the human I4 data, we found over-
lapping DEGs for both upregulated (5–12%) and downregulated
(16–30%) genes (Fig. 2b). Moreover, compared to the human data, the
“murine spaceﬂight signature” was directionally consistent in all
comparisons (20/20, 100%) and statistically signiﬁcant (18/20 path-
ways, 90%) by GSEA for both up and down-regulated genes (padj <
0.05) (Fig. 2c) and Fisher’s exact test (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary
Fig. 10a), indicating a core set of human and murine responses to
spaceﬂight.
We next expanded the human and mouse comparisons at the
pathway level. Over-representation analysis of the murine spaceﬂight
signature showed enrichment of ribosomal translation and metabo-
lism in down-regulated DEGs and signaling, response to stimulus, and
metabolism in upregulated DEGs, overlapping with the I4 pathways
(Supplementary Data 1 and 6). The GSEA result of the I4 data and
the murine spaceﬂight signature showed statistically signiﬁcant over-
lap (Fisher’s exact test. padj; Hallmark: 3.845e-02, C2: 3.317e-47, C5:
2.341e-83) (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Down-regulated pathways con-
sistent across both cohorts included OXPHOS, Myc targets, ribosome,
infectious disease, viral gene expression, inﬂuenza infection, and
translation pathways (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Also, mitotic spindle,
UV response DN pathway, and TCF21 targets pathway were also con-
sistently, signiﬁcantly up-regulated (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Of note,
the pathway scores (−log10(padj)*sign(NES)) were positively corre-
lated in the I4 murine signatures (Pearson correlation, R = 0.82, slope:

0.69) (Fig. 2d). Next, we compared the I4 data to the NASA Twins study
immune cell RNA-seq7–9, and found that the immune cell DEGs were
statistically signiﬁcantly for up- and down-regulated DEGs when
compared to the I4 data (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Additionally, the
Twins’ GSEA proﬁles overlapped with the I4 GSEA proﬁles, showing
enrichment in OXPHOS, Myc targets v1, and UV response, consistent
with the I4 signature (Fig. 2e). These results were conﬁrmed in the
I4 skin spatial transcriptome data, where the skin and subregion down-
regulated DEGs were statistically signiﬁcantly (padj < 0.05) down-
regulated in I4 data (Fig. 2f) and the pathway scores were positively
correlated in the I4 (Fig. 2g), including ribosomal translation, OXPHOS,
UV response pathways (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 10d) in
response to spaceﬂight. However, EVP and plasma proteomics data45

OXPHOS pathways, but did overlap with NPM1, immunoglobulin
complex, and blood microparticle pathways.
Changes in gravity and radiation both occur in spaceﬂight, but are
confounded in most studies, making it difﬁcult to delineate which
factor leads to the cellular changes observed in astronauts. To better
distinguish between the contributions of radiation and microgravity,
we compared the I4 data to a set of 375 DEGs observed in single-cell
RNA-seq data from in vitro PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity
(μG) for 25 h. Monocytes (e.g., CD14) and dendritic cells, which are
myeloid-derived cells, showed higher DEG overlap (16–43%) vs. the
lymphoid-derived cells (2–5% for T cells, B cells, and NK cells), giving
further evidence that lymphoid-derived cells are less sensitive to
microgravity (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 10f). GSEA analysis of μG-
simulated DEGs showed no signiﬁcant enrichment in OXPHOS, ribo-
somal translation, and UV response (Supplementary Fig. 10g), indi-
cating that most of the responses in PBMCs are likely from radiation
and other spaceﬂight stressors, rather than changes in gravity.
Since the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) and Human
leukocyte
antigens
(HLA)
markers
is
known
to
change
after
spaceﬂight46, we further analyzed the expression of CDs and HLAs in
our immune cells. We found the long-term suppression of MHC class I
genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, B2M) in the I4 immune cells (Fig. 2h). This
long-term suppression was cross-validated in the NASA Twins Study
data, the JAXA cfRNA proﬁles, and the I4 plasma cfRNA, which showed
sometimes a spike in activity in ﬂight, but a consistent and signiﬁcant
(q value < 0.05, FDR-corrected) decrease of MHC class I genes (HLA-A,
HLA-B, HLA-C, B2M) genes post-ﬂight across all missions and most cell
types (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Finally, to identify potential drugs or supplements that can
reverse these effects on the immune system, we used a novel
compound-gene interactome machine learning algorithm to identify
drugs and vitamins that signiﬁcantly map to altered genes44. Using
these algorithms, we identiﬁed 148 compounds that signiﬁcantly map
to DEGs of PBMCs and subpopulations (Supplementary Data 7). Based
on PBMC subpopulation alterations, these potential compounds could
identify biological targets for countermeasure development to opti-
mize human performance and could be tested to mitigate potential
negative health effects resulting from spaceﬂight exposure2,47.
Spaceﬂight-induced immune dysregulation mirrors monocyte
dysregulation, infection phenotypes, TCF21, and FOXP3
regulation
The prolonged dysregulation of CD14 monocytes observed in our data
(Supplementary Fig. 9c) led us to next examine immune-associated
clinical symptoms reported with spaceﬂight6,48, especially since
monocytes are responsible for cytokine production, phagocytosis, and
antigen presentation. First, to validate the CD14 dysregulation, we
compared the I4 CD14 monocyte data to previously reported mono-
cyte dysregulation markers linked to clinical symptoms22,23,49, which
conﬁrmed the down-regulation of ﬁve known markers in the I4 CD14
monocytes (e.g., SELL, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB5, IL6, CD14) and an
increase in TLR4 across both gene expression and ATAC-seq data
(Fig. 3a). When examining I4 immune cell DEGs (padj < 0.05) (Sup-
plementary Data 8), we also found a decrease in the pathways asso-
ciated with response to infection, including COVID-19, Kaposi
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, CMV, tuberculosis, graft-versus-host
defense, and Salmonella infection (KEGG pathways, p-adj < 0.05, Sup-
plementary Data 8), and validated with a GSEA analysis (Fig. 3b).
Finally, to examine the capacity for B-cell function, we examined the
increased BCR mutation rate (Supplementary Fig. 7g), which is caused
by somatic hypermutation secondary to antigen exposure or inﬂam-
matory stimuli. Indeed, single-cell expression data suggested possible
up-regulation of BCR signaling pathway genes in B cells immediately
post-ﬂight (Supplementary Fig. 12a).
Given the TCF21 and FOXP3 pathway changes (Fig. 1c, Fig. 2d,
Supplementary Fig. 12b, c), we next examined the activity of target
genes in cellular subtypes. For all immune cells, the TCF21 target gene
enrichment score was increased at R + 1 (Fig. 3c). And it is conﬁrmed by
the motif activity score of ATAC data in T and B cells (Supplementary
Fig. 9d). In T cells, FOXP3 target gene enrichment score was increased
(Fig. 3d), and again conﬁrmed by the motif activity score of ATAC data
(Supplementary Fig. 9d). Changes in FOXP3 suggested changes in T
cell regulation during spaceﬂight50–52, and potentially altered immune
function post-ﬂight, which is in line with the GSEA results and KEGG
pathways (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 8). We further validated FOXP3
upregulation in T cells and Treg cell activation after spaceﬂight by
analyzing Treg activation markers53 and FOXP3 target genes across
T cells (Fig. 3e, f, Supplementary Fig. 12d). Our data indeed showed an
increase in Treg activation markers at R + 1, which recovered over time
in both gene expression and ATAC data in both T cells and Treg cells
(Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 12d). Finally, we orthogonally validated the
FOXP3 expression and Treg activation markers53 in FACS-isolated
T cells by qPCR, which showed a post-ﬂight increase in expression at
R + 1 in all targets (Fig. 3g), and a statistically signiﬁcant increase
(Student’s t test, padj < 0.1) for FOXP3, IL1R1, IL1R2, IL2RA, VPS53,
and VPS54.
Sex-dependent differences in response to spaceﬂight and
recovery
Since little is known about sex-dependent differences in response to
spaceﬂight54,55, we next examined differential effects on the immune
systems of the I4 crew by sex. First, we compared the ratio of up- and
down-regulated DEGs (Fig. 4a) between males and females, which
showed a higher number of DEGs in males for almost all cell types.
Second, the overlap of up-/down-regulated DEGs between females and
males showed a partial overlap (Fig. 4b), with down-regulated DEGs
showing a higher overlap percentage (average of up-regulated genes:
51.9%, average of down-regulated genes: 84.1%). Next, GSEA was per-
formed to gain a pathway-based view of sex-dependent gene expres-
sion changes. Down-regulated pathways for OXPHOS and Myc targets
and up-regulated pathways for mitotic spindle and UV response were
conserved between the sexes (Supplementary Fig. 13a). To expand

upon these results, we used Ingenuity IPA for the sex-speciﬁc DEGs
(padj < 0.05). More pathways were altered in males at R + 1 across
almost all cell types (Supplementary Data 9). Notably, gene expression
differences in estrogen signaling have also been observed in female vs.
male B cells56.
We further analyzed the CD and HLA genes with sex-speciﬁc or
common, DEGs in the immune cells (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Data 10).
Both CD79A and CD79B were down-regulated (adj-p value < 0.01) in
females (R + 1), and other CDs also showed negative or positive
female-to-male (F/M) log2FC ratios (Fig. 4c). In B cells, CD69 and
CD83 showed down-regulation at landing for both sexes, yet CD55
was upregulated only in females. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C were all
down-regulated in all immune cells in both sexes, immediately post-
ﬂight (Fig. 4c), but only males showed persistent HLA-A down-
regulation post-ﬂight. In DCs, NK cells, and CD4 T cells, males showed
down-regulation of ribosomal protein-encoding genes and OXPHOS
(Supplementary Data 9). OXPHOS was inhibited in female B cells, and
mitochondrial genes were also downregulated only in females. The
CD4 and CD8 DEGs showed activation of T cell receptor (TCR) sig-
naling (z-scores: 2 and 2.449, respectively) at R + 1 in females (Sup-
plementary Data 9). In contrast, TCR signaling was inhibited, with
unique DEGs in male DCs. There was also a signiﬁcant up-regulation

DCs (Supplementary Data 10).
Leveraging the ATAC-seq data, we compared the male/female
activity scores of enriched DNA motifs at R + 1 for all cell types. In CD4
and CD8 T cells, the motif activity scores at R + 1 were higher in
females, but the recovery pattern was similar (Supplementary Fig. 13b,
Supplementary Data 11). In B cells and CD16 monocytes, the motif
activity scores were higher in females at R + 1 but higher in males at
R + 45, indicating these chromatin changes persisted longer in males.
In NK cells and other cell types, the motif activity scores were higher in
males at R + 1. Additionally, the activity scores of CEBPB, CEBPD, and
CEBPE were higher in males at R + 45 in CD14 monocytes, further
pointing to CD14’s signiﬁcance and long-term chromatin disruption.
Finally, to discern the generalizability of sex-speciﬁc changes, we
used a replication cohort of 64 NASA astronauts and compared it to the
I4 mission, and we also examined sex-dependent changes in serum
BCPs from a study with 27 other targets57 (Supplementary Data 12).
These additional data showed that cytokine and acute phase reactant
proteins (i.e., IL-8, CRP, and ﬁbrinogen) conﬁrmed differences across
sex and mission length. In both males and females, mean serum CRP
levels were higher on R + 0 compared to L-180 (2.1 ± 2.4 vs 1.3 ± 1.9 mg/L
and 3.7 ± 5.7 vs 1.7 ± 2.2 mg/L, respectively), and mean CRP values were
higher in females than males (Supplementary Data 12). Sex and time
interaction was observed in IL-6, IL-8, and ﬁbrinogen, and there was a
signiﬁcant difference between males and females for IL-8 and ﬁbrinogen
(Post hoc Bonferroni t-test, q value < 0.05).
Spaceﬂight-associated immune cell gene expression changes
potentially associated with microbiome abundance
Given our observation that spaceﬂight-associated immune change
bears a resemblance to infection, we next aimed to identify if there were
observable correlations between DEGs and speciﬁc bacterial and viral
microbiome features as a function of ﬂight. Speciﬁcally, the abundance
of bacterial and viral taxonomies correlated with DEGs was examined
across all cell types. We used a regression-based approach (See Meth-
ods) to illuminate relationships between DEGs and bacterial/viral
taxonomic abundances across 10 body sites derived from shotgun
metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequencing (Supplementary
Data 13)58. We compared the results of our associations across reg-
ularized (LASSO) regression and linear mixed models across different
normalization methods and different taxonomic classiﬁers and ranks,
ﬁnding overall concordant results (Supplementary Figs. 14, 15). We note

that this effort is meant to be exploratory; the overall low sample size
and number of statistical tests being executed could inﬂate false posi-
tives. It is for this reason we emphasize (Fig. 5) total magnitude of FDR/

that were Bonferroni signiﬁcant and had non-zero lasso coefﬁcients,
CD14 monocytes had the most bacterial associations (Fig. 5c). Viral
associations were, by comparison, predominantly in NK cells and T
cells. As such, the enrichment of pathogen-response pathways linked
to microbial features indicates that microbiome shifts may drive a
portion of immune response to spaceﬂight. Various genes for cell
proliferation (i.e., STAT1), ribosomal genes, and various pathways of
pathogen infection (RPL28, RPS27A, RPL10, RPL13, RPL11, RPSA, UBA52)
were associated with bacteria (Fig. 5d, top panel), notably in CD14
monocytes. Viruses (Fig. 5d, bottom panel) were also associated with
genes involved in inﬂammatory response but with some distinct
associations. These included inﬂammatory cytokine signaling (JAK2,
STAT3, STAT1), immune cell differentiation (HLA-DQA2, HLA-DPA1),
and immune cell adhesion (ITGA4). Viruses were notably associated
with HLA gene expression across CD16 monocytes, NK cells, and DCs.
Discussion
This study provides the most comprehensive immune proﬁling of
astronauts to date, including single-cell multi-omics data, antibody
isotypes, cfRNA abundance, BCR/TCR diversity, TFBS enrichments,
sex-dependent changes, microbiome interactions, integration of other
astronaut and mouse missions, and potential countermeasures. The I4
crew showed several cytokine and gene regulatory changes that mir-
rored longer-duration missions, including increased IL-6, IL-10, and
MCP-1 and post-ﬂight decreases in MHC class I genes. The post-ﬂight
decrease in MHC class I genes was conserved in the I4 immune cells, I4
plasma cfRNA, JAXA plasma cfRNA, and NASA Twins Study immune
cells. Of note, the ‘spaceﬂight signatures of I4 astronauts’ were also
conserved in the I4 immune cells, the NASA Twins Study, and the meta-
analysis of 27 GeneLab mouse spaceﬂight studies, which consistently
showed dysregulated OXPHOS, translation, UV response, and TCF21
pathways (Supplementary Data 15). Moreover, these data showed a
pronounced sex- and cell-type speciﬁcity regarding responsiveness
and recovery from spaceﬂight, with the most and least sensitive cells
being CD14 monocytes and CD16 monocytes and T cells, respectively.
With these results, the I4 data enabled a unique molecular portrait of a
civilian crew with a more diverse genetic and biomedical background
than most NASA crews, which are generally restrictive cohorts.
While promising in terms of cellular recovery proﬁles, the I4
mission was not designed to determine the safety of spaceﬂight for all
civilians, nor should these data alone be used to make judgments for
future crew selection, number, age, sex, or ﬁtness for spaceﬂight.
Moreover, some functions of chromatin accessibility or gene regula-
tion differences are inferred (e.g., chromVAR), and will need additional
characterization in future studies. Nonetheless, the molecular mea-
sures from the I4 crew enabled new comparisons to prior missions
(e.g., the NASA Twins Study, NASA JSC data, JAXA cfRNA) and meta-
analysis of the space-ﬂown mouse studies (817 samples across
27
datasets
encompassing
10 different
mouse tissues),
which
mostly conﬁrmed our observations for the signiﬁcantly altered
pathways. Overall, a rapid gene and chromatin recovery was seen
for the crew across most cell types, save for the CD14 monocytes and
16 monocytes, and these data can serve as additional baseline bio-
medical data and context for future missions. Repeated measures of
pre- and post-ﬂight metrics of crews will enable better contextualiza-
tion and statistical rigor by researchers and clinicians and enable gui-
dance for how astronauts can serve as their own controls (within-
subjects design) by using their pre-ﬂight immune marker levels as a
reference.
A limitation of this study was the relatively low number of parti-
cipants, which is a common challenge in spaceﬂight studies. While the
collection workﬂows and timing were standardized to minimize var-
iation (e.g., morning blood draws, crew training, and oversight during
collection), some cell and sample variations can still occur. As such,
our results focused on signiﬁcantly shifted genes and pathways con-
sistently observed across all crew members. In addition, we utilized a
battery of other studies to validate our observations, including other
astronaut data, NASA Twins Study data, JAXA CFE data, in vitro
microgravity-simulated PBMCs, I4 cfRNA data, meta-analysis of the
GeneLab mouse studies, as well as other omics data from the I4 mis-
sion. Of particular interest are the differential changes between I4
PBMCs and the in vitro-simulated microgravity PBMCs, which enabled
a novel way to differentiate the likely impact of radiation vs. micro-
gravity on human PBMCs, which indicates that radiation is a likely
larger driver of the cellular responses. Of course, simulated cells can
still be inﬂuenced by other experimental factors (e.g., space radiation,
ﬂuid shifts, environment, temperature), and future studies should seek
to

Sex-speciﬁc variation in immune response is frequently observed
in clinical settings, but poorly understood, and this phenomenon has
yet to be investigated in-depth at the single-cell level during space-
ﬂight. Here, we observed that males appear to be more affected by
spaceﬂight, for almost all cell types and metrics, experiencing more
DEGs, slower recovery to the baseline of DEGs, and a slower recovery
of the chromatin accessibility. In addition, IL-6, IL-8, and ﬁbrinogen
differences by sex were conﬁrmed in the replication cohort of NASA
astronauts (n = 64). Sex differences also were observed in certain CD
and HLA genes (Supplementary Data 9, 10), including a greater number
of downregulated HLA genes in male DCs (SupplementaryData 10). For
example, CD83 is expressed on mature dendritic cells, and it was
downregulated in male DCs at R + 1 (Supplementary Data 10). Under
simulated microgravity, DCs had decreased expressions of HLA-DR
and impaired phagocytosis59, which aligns with our results. While
dysregulation of immune function, oxidative phosphorylation, and
Myc target pathways were conserved in both males and females, the
aggregate data thus far indicates that the gene regulatory and immune
response to spaceﬂight is more sensitive in males. More studies will be
needed to conﬁrm these trends, but such results can have implications
for recovery times and possibly crew selection (e.g., more females) for
high-altitude, lunar, and deep space missions.
We additionally observed increased expression in many immune
cell pathways associated with pathogens. Immune cell activity is
known to be speciﬁcally associated with shifts in host bacterial and
viral content60–63. Microgravity has the potential to affect gene reg-
ulations in various tissues, including interactions between the host
immune system and microbiome64. Bacteria can directly regulate
immune cell activity and viral activation65–68, and herpes virus

reactivation is associated with spaceﬂight69. When associating micro-
biome features with DEGs, we identiﬁed that many of the pathways
most associated with bacterial and viral shifts before and after ﬂight
were additionally related to pathogen colonization. As a result, we
hypothesize that a portion of the immune activation in ﬂight could be
arising from microbiome shifts. However, our microbiome integration
results are descriptive and, in future studies, could be further
strengthened by mechanistic experiments, targeted microbiome
interventions, and larger sample sizes. Further, although we used
techniques standard for the ﬁeld, other microbiome analytic methods
(i.e., gene-level analysis and other machine-learning approaches) could
tease further signals from the data. Indeed, the substantial differences
between bacterial and viral responses indicate discrete mechanisms of
immune response and provide targets for future studies.
In conclusion, these convergent signatures of spaceﬂight begin to
detail the core, consistent set of human cellular and molecular
responses to spaceﬂight and can help narrow the targets for coun-
termeasures and monitoring in future studies. Moreover, any potential
long-term changes need to be monitored longitudinally to scan for any
reversion or exacerbation of the phenotypes before pharmacological
or biomedical interventions can be considered. Exploring the data
introduced here is enabled through our interactive data portal (https://
soma.weill.cornell.edu)
and
downloadable
through
public
and
controlled-access repositories (NASA Open Science Data Repositories
and GeneLab/ALSDA). In the coming years, NASA plans to put the ﬁrst
woman and ﬁrst person of color on the Moon, and such ambitious
missions can leverage the data shown here, which details cell-, person-,
and sex-speciﬁc molecular data, thus guiding more precise risk miti-
gation, crew health monitoring, and long-term countermeasure
development.
Methods
IRB statement human subjects research
All subjects were consented at an informed consent brieﬁng at SpaceX
(Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the
approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell
Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have con-
sented to data and sample sharing. Tissue samples were provided by
SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use of
the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed
guidelines set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act and operated under IRB-approved protocols. Experiments were
conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval
of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569).
PBMC isolation and single-cell library preparation
For each crew member, 8 mL of venous blood was collected in EDTA
anticoagulant tubes. Depletion of granulocytes was performed either
directly from whole blood using the RosetteSepTM granulocyte
depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood
was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µL/mL of blood)
for 20 min at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was
utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After
washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs
were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTM
granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to
density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identiﬁed using
side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted
using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion,
PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single cell V(D)J T-cell
and B-cell libraries or multiomic (GEX and ATAC) libraries. To capture
T-cell and B-cell V(D)J repertoire, single cell gel beads-in-emulsion and
libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10X Genomics). Prior to single
cell multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation
was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µL of cold lysis buffer
containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1%
Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and
1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 min on ice, followed
by the addition of 1 mL cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20,
1 mM DTT, 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (500 × g for
5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in a diluted nuclei buffer (10X
Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6000
nuclei per µL. Single-cell libraries were generated via the Chromium
Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X
Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequencing
In total, six timepoints were sequenced, including 92 days pre-ﬂight
(June), 44 days pre-ﬂight (August), pre-ﬂight (Pre-September), post-
ﬂight (Post-September), 45 days post-ﬂight (November), 82 days post-
ﬂight (December). The libraries sequenced for each timepoint inclu-
ded ATAC, GEX, and VDJ (TCR + BCR) libraries. Four libraries corre-
sponding to the four astronauts were prepared for each timepoint and
library type, except for the June and August timepoints for which VDJ
libraries were not prepared. In total, there were 24 ATAC and GEX
libraries and 32 VDJ libraries, which were sequenced in three batches.
The concentration of each library was taken using the Invitrogen Qubit
1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit and run on Agilent Tapestation 2100 using
Agilent Technologies D1000 reagents and Screentape for fragment
analysis. The nanomolarity of each sample was calculated using the
formula ((concentration (ng/µl)/ (660 g/mol)* fragment size (bp))
*10^6. After the nanomolarity was obtained for each sample, the target
nanomolarity was determined using the lowest nanomolarity of the
sample libraries. The desired number of reads per sample was deter-
mined based on the following criterion: 35,000 read pairs per cell for
ATAC libraries, 25,000 read pairs per cell for GEX libraries, and 5000
read pairs per cell for VDJ libraries. Following this, the total number of
reads per pool of samples was determined by adding all the read pairs
per sample, and the percentage of total read pairs of each pool that is
made up of each sample was determined using this formula (desired
read pairs for sample/total read pairs for the pool) × 100. The target
volume (µL) for each pool was determined based on requirements for
sequencing, ﬁnal molarity, etc. In this case, 200 µL was used for the
ATAC library pool, and 100 µL was used for both the VDJ and GEX
library pools. The target volume (µL) for each sample was then calcu-
lated based on the percentage of the total pool calculated earlier, using
the desired ﬁnal pool volume. Based on the target nanomolarity,
sample nanomolarity, and sample target volume, the input volume
(uL) for each sample was calculated using the following formula
((target nanomolarity * sample target volume)/sample nanomolarity).
If the volume of each individual sample does not meet the target
sample volume the rest of the volume can be made up using nuclease-
free water. The total volume of both the samples and nuclease-free
water should add up to the target pool volume. Following these
pooling protocols, the samples were sequenced on the NovaSeq
6000 sequencing system.
Alignment
GEX and ATAC libraries were processed using Cell Ranger arc v2.0.0.
VDJ libraries were processed using Cell Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were
aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. We generated single-cell
combined transcriptome and ATAC data from PBMCs from individuals
with Inspiration4 mission crews across three pre-ﬂight (June 2021: L-
92, August 2021: L-44, September Pre-launch: L-3) and three postﬂight
(September Post-launch: R + 1, November 2021: R + 45, December 2021:
R + 82). We mapped the single-cell multi-ome (GEX + ATAC) data using
10X chromium cellranger-arc (10X Genomics). We followed the 10X
single-cell multi-ome analysis pipeline as previously reported and

adpated for this data as decribes in this Methods section11. 151,411 cells
passed quality control after quality control (minimum of 200 genes,
maximum of 4500 gene counts, maximum of 20% mitochondrial
reads, maximum of 100,000 peak counts, maximum of two nucleo-
some signal, and minimum of TSS enrichment per cell). Data were
integrated using Harmony70.
Processing of single-cell data
To identify putative cell types, Azimuth (version 0.3.2) pipeline was
used with the reference dataset of Human. We annotated PBMCs
subpopulations by supervised analysis guided by the Azimuth PBMC
reference generated from single-cell transcriptome and CITE-seq71. For
cellular proportion comparison after spaceﬂight, a p-value less than
0.05 with Wilcoxon rank sum test is considered signiﬁcant. Differen-
tially expressed genes and differentially accessible regions were
identiﬁed with the FindMarkers function in Seurat (v4.2.0) packages (|
log2FC | > 0.25 and padj < 0.05 with the default setting for other
parameters). FindMotifs function in Seurat packages with default set-
tings was used to identify the enriched transcription factor based on
DARs. By running chromVAR, we computed a per-cell motif activity
score (chromVAR deviation z-score of TF motifs) to visualize motif
activities per cell. GeneActivity function in Signac package with default
settings was used to quantify gene activity from ATAC, which generate
a rough estimate of the transcriptional activity of each gene by quan-
tifying ATAC-seq counts in the 2 kb-upstream region and gene body.
AddModuleScore function in Seurat package with default setting was
used to calculate the average expression levels of each program
(cluster) on single cell level, subtracted by the aggregated expression
of control feature sets. TCR and BCR-aligned data were analyzed with
the
VGenes
package
(https://github.com/WilsonImmunologyLab/
VGenes).
Biochemical proﬁling (BCP) and complete blood count (CBC)
Complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panels
were completed by Quest Diagnostics. One 4 mL tube of whole blood
collected in a K2 EDTA tube was used for the CBC, test code 6399.
500 µL of serum from a serum separator tube (SST) was submitted for
the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), test code 10231. Serum
samples were submitted to Eve Technologies for the biomarker pro-
ﬁling panels (1) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay®
Array (HD71) and (2) Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex
Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9). Concentration values were extra-
polated using a four of ﬁve parameter logic standard curve. Samples
were normalized by the mean of the preﬂight value of each crew. For
BCP and CBC, a p value lessthan 0.05 with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test
is considered signiﬁcant. We analyzed the previously reported astro-
naut BCPs57 by further delineating the effect of sex- and time by Two-
way ANOVA with a post hoc Bonferroni t-test.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of immune cells
The granulocyte-depleted peripheral blood samples were subjected
to ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting to sort out different subsets of
immune cells. Brieﬂy, the frozen samples were thawed, and washed in
cell staining buffer (Biolegend, cat no.420201). The cells were
resuspended and incubated with monocyte blocking solution (Bio-
legend, cat no. 426102) and Fc Receptor Blocking Solution (Biole-
gend, cat no. 422301) for 20 min, followed by incubation with CD3
(T cells) (BD, cat no. 555342), CD19 (B cells) (Biolegend, cat
no.302207), CD14 (Monocyte) (BD, cat no. 563420), and CD56 (for
NK cells) (BD, cat no. 564058) for 30 min, washed twice in the cell
staining buffer and resuspended in the same buffer. Right before
sorting DAPI was added to eliminate dead cells during sorting. The
gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3d. The different
immune cells were directly sorted into RNAlater for RNA extraction
for further validation studies.
Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (qPCR)
FACS-isolated T cells were used for RNA extraction with RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen, cat no.74134). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript™III
First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, cat no.
18080051). TaqMan™Fast Advanced system (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,

Meta-analysis of GeneLab RNA-seq data from 817 samples across
27 datasets encompassing ten different mouse tissues
FASTQ ﬁles were programmatically downloaded from GeneLab
(https://genelab.nasa.gov/) and processed using the MTD pipeline72. A
meta-analysis of the GeneLab data was performed in two steps. Firstly,
we performed batch correction using Combat-seq73 to standardize
data across different datasets. Subsequently, DESeq274 was used to
perform differential expression analysis between the spaceﬂight and
ground control mice while adjusting for age, sex, tissue, sacriﬁce site,
and mission duration. The meta-analysis was done using DeSeq2 (wald
test, two-tailed) based on batch(study)-corrected count matrix calcu-
lated with combat-seq. Multiple testing adjustment was done using
Benjamini-hochberg. This analysis resulted in a ‘spaceﬂight signature
in mice’ consisting of 2184 differentially expressed genes (1288 up-
regulated and 896 down-regulated). To visually conﬁrm that the genes
in the spaceﬂight signature were changing in a similar direction across
datasets based on differential expression analysis on each dataset
separately grouping by tissue, sex, age, and mission duration.
Principal component analysis
Prcomp function of R was used to calculate principal components
from gene expression and peak expression proﬁles.
Enrichment analysis
ssGSEA. ssGSEA package was used to calculate the normalized
enrichment score with MSigDB pathways. For T cell activity score,

fgsea. fGSEA package was used to calculate the normalized enrich-
ment score and the adjusted p-value with MSigDB Hallmark, MSigDB
C2, MSigDB C5, and custom pathways generated with ranked gene sets
from various datasets. Here is an example of the pre-ranked GSEA
pipeline we performed. (a). Prepare the pathway collection In our case,
we used MSigDB, “spaceﬂight signature of mice”, or DEGs from the
selected study (b). Prepare the ranked list of genes. We ranked the
gene sets by the adjusted p value, a combination of log2FC multiplied
by −log10 (adjusted p value (or p value)), or stat. There are several ways
to rank the gene sets by correlation, p value, adjusted p value, log2FC,
stat, or combination of log2FC and adjusted p value (or p value)
derived from the differential expression analysis. (c). Run GSEA

analysis.
gProﬁler
(https://biit.cs.ut.ee/
gproﬁler/) was used to identify signiﬁcantly enriched (padj < 0.05)
GO or KEGG pathways. All DEGs, up-regulated DEGs, downregulated
DEGs, microbiome-associated DEGs were used as input.
Canonical pathway analysis
Data were analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA, version 01-22-01) (QIAGEN Inc.) software with DEGs, FDR < 0.05.
Common DEGs between females and males and sex-speciﬁc DEGs were
used for canonical pathways.
Gene and pathway overlap analysis
I4 and GeneLab mouse data comparison. To compare the spaceﬂight
signature in mice against the gene expression changes in Inspiration 4,
we mapped the mouse genes to their human equivalent using Ensembl
Biomart75, which resulted in 1942 human orthologues (1147 upregu-
lated and 795 downregulated). These human orthologues were then
compared against differentially expressed (padj < 0.05) in I4.
Fisher’s exact test. To calculate the signiﬁcance of the overlap we
used Fisher’s exact test implemented in the R package GeneOverlap
(https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/GeneOverlap).
P
values
for
the
overlaps were adjusted by multiple tests using Benjamini-Hochberg
method76. We found that 80% of the comparisons in level 1 cell anno-
tation were statistically signiﬁcant, while 56% were signiﬁcant in level 2
annotation. Notably, all comparisons involving down-regulated genes
in the spaceﬂight signature in mice and I4 showed statistical sig-
niﬁcance. None of the comparisons between down-regulated gene sets
in Inspiration 4 against up-regulated genes in the spaceﬂight signature
in mice (and vice versa) yielded statistical signiﬁcance in either level 1
or 2 cell annotations.
GSEA-based overlap analysis. By GSEA, ranking the genes from the
GeneLab meta-analysis by the negative logarithm of the p-value mul-
tiplied by the sign of the fold change (i.e., 1 if positive, −1 if negative)
and evaluating whether genes differentially expressed in each cell type
in I4 were enriched in either direction of the ranked ordered list. For
this calculation, we used the R package fgsea77.
I4 skin spatial transcriptomics. Skin biopsy samples from the four
crew members were collected and frozen in cryovials pre and post
ﬂight. Collected skin was ﬂash embedded in OCT blocks. Four replicate
of OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide, per astro-
naut,including pre and post ﬂight replicates. Tissues were then cryo-
sectioned at 5 µm thickness and attached to glass microscope slides
(Fisher Scientiﬁc, cat# 22-037-246). Immunoﬂuorescent visualization
marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat# NBP2-33200, Alexa
Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3), ﬁbroblast activation protein (FAP,
Abcam cat# ab222924, Alexa Fluor® 594, clone ID EPR20021) and
smooth muscle actin (SMA, R&D Systems cat# IC1420R, Alexa Fluor®
647, clone 1A4) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The
DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes col-
lected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed
overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 °C followed by
PBS washes for thorough ﬁxation. After washes, slides were prepared
following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol
for ﬁxed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/mL proteinase
K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100 °C (NanoString, no.
MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Tran-
scriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM ﬁnal concentration
were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were pre-
pared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and
SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated
with 225 µl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in
SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The 20× scan
was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal
(OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA)
regions. OE ROIs covered spinous and granular layers, while IE ROIs
covered the basal layer, identiﬁed from the staining of the tissue. To
ensure proper selection and to avoid overlaps across different ROI
types, small gaps between each ROI type were made. GeoMx WTA
sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ ﬁles
corresponding to each ROI. FASTQ ﬁles were then converted to digital
count conversion ﬁles using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline.
Additional methods can be found in ref. 42.
Metagenomics

DNA/RNA
isolation,
sequencing, and analysis. Brieﬂy, we ran all metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic samples through standard microbiome quality
control pipelines using bbtools78 (deduplication, quality trimming,
adapter removal, human read decontamination), and then computed
taxonomic abundances with a variety of methods, those relevant to
this manuscript being Xtree aligning to the Genome Taxonomy Data-
base r20779, Xtree aligning to the complete set of non-redundant
genomes in GenBank, MetaPhlAn480, and Phanta81. We report results
from all four of these approaches in the manuscript at the phylum,
genus, and species ranks.
We used two approaches to identify associations between differ-
entially expressed human genes and bacteria/viruses. First, we used
Lasso regression to identify relationships between all DEGs for a given
cell type and microbial features, characterizing any non-zero Lasso
coefﬁcient as a “potential association.” We use this phrasing because
Lasso regression does not implicitly include statistical inference,
therefore not controlling for false positive rates. We ﬁt models of the
form:
humangene ∼microbe1 + ::: + microben
ð1Þ
We ﬁt different models for bacteria and viruses (e.g., for one
model, microbe1..x would be all bacteria, for another it would be all
viruses). Prior to regressing, we centered and scaled the human gene
abundances. We computed lasso models with both log transformed
microbial abundances as well as Center-Log-Ratio transformed abun-
dances, adding a pseudocount in the form of the smallest abundance
value for a given matrix beforehand in both cases.
As a second form of association identiﬁcation with the added
beneﬁt of statistical inference to control for false positives, we used a
mixed effect linear regression approach for each microbe/DEG pair
that had a non-zero coefﬁcient coming out of the Lasso regressions.
We transformed the gene/microbe abundances with the same

approaches as above and ﬁt models of the form:
humangene ∼microbe + ð1jCrewIDÞ
ð2Þ
CrewID is a random effect corresponding to the different indivi-
duals meant to account for interindividual variation in microbial fea-
ture abundance. We used Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple
hypothesis testing, computing the threshold cutoff per cell type based
on as the total number of microbes in a given rank and domain (e.g., all
bacterial phyla, all bacterial genera, all bacterial species, all viral phyla,
all viral genera) times the number of DEGs for a given cell type. This
was meant to minimize the overall Bonferroni threshold. Additional
methods for generating the bacterial and viral taxonomic abundance
data used in the immune-microbiome associations are described in
companion manuscripts58,82.
I4 cfRNA processing
Plasma was frozen at −80 °C until processed. Before RNA extraction,
plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and subsequently
centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. cfRNA was isolated from the
plasma supernatant (300–800 µL) using the Norgen Plasma/Serum
Circulating and Exosomal RNA Puriﬁcation Mini Kit (Catalog No.
51000, Norgen). Next, 10 mL of DNase Turbo Buffer (Catalog No.
AM2238, Invitrogen), 3 mL of DNase Turbo (Catalog No. AM2238,
Invitrogen), and 1 mL of Baseline Zero DNase (Catalog No. DB0715K,
Lucigen-Epicenter) was added to the extracted RNA and incubated for
30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the treated RNA was concentrated into
a ﬁnal volume of 12 mL with the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit
(Catalog No. R1015, Zymo).
Sequencing libraries prepared from 8 μL of concentrated RNA
using the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3—Pico Input
Mammalian (634485, Takara) and barcoded using the SMARTer RNA
Unique Dual Index Kit (634451, Takara). Library concentration was
quantiﬁed using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Q33216, Invitrogen) with the
dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Invitrogen). Libraries were quality-
controlled using an Agilent Fragment Analyzer 5200 (M5310AA, Agi-
lent) with the HS NGS Fragment kit (DNF-474-0500, Agilent). Libraries
were pooled to equal concentrations and sequenced at Cornell
Genomics on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 machine using 150-base pair,
paired-end sequencing for an average of 26 million reads per sample.
Sequencing data was processed using a custom bioinformatics
pipeline utilizing the Snakemake workﬂow management system
(v7.7.0). Reads were quality ﬁltered and trimmed using BBDUK
(v38.90), aligned to the Gencode GRCh38 human reference genome
(v38, primary assembly) using STAR (v2.7.0f) default parameters,
deduplicated using UMI tools (v1.1.2), and features quantiﬁed using
featureCount (v2.0.0). Mitochondrial, ribosomal, X, and Y chromo-
some genes were removed prior to analysis. cfRNA sample quality was
determined by calculating DNA contamination (intron/exon ratio),
rRNA contamination, number of feature counts, and RNA degradation.
All samples passed QC. Read counts of technical duplicate samples
were combined for downstream analyses.
Cell-type deconvolution was performed using BayesPrism (v2.0)
with the Tabula Sapiens single cell RNA-seq atlas (Release 1)83,84. Cells
from the Tabula Sapiens atlas were grouped as previously described in
ref. 85. Comparative analysis of DEGs was performed using a negative
binomial model as implemented in the DESeq2 package (v1.34.0) using
a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value cutoff < 0.05, unless other-
wise stated. Variance stabilization transformation was used for com-
paring and plotting gene counts, unless otherwise stated.
I4 secretome data
Plasma samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min and then
Extracellular
Vesicles
and
Particles
(EVPs)
were
collected
by
ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min. EVPs were then washed
in PBS and again collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for
70 min. The ﬁnal EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS. Two micrograms
of enriched EVPs were digested and analyzed with LC-MS/MS in data-
dependent acquisition mode. The list of differentially abundant pro-
teins from the plasma proteomics data was ﬁltered for differentially
expressed genes that had an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 1.
Heatmaps were generated with mitochondrial and oxidative stress
genes using R package pheatmap. Additional protocol details on EVP
proteomic proﬁling is described in ref. 86.

been downloaded from the previous publication7. In brief, one
astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission
onboard the ISS, and his identical twin sibling was also monitored at
the same time, serving as a genetically matched ground control for
this study.
JAXA CFE cfRNA data
Plasma cell-free RNA differential expression data and study protocols
were shared through NASA’s GeneLab platform with accession number
GLDS-530/OSD-530. Brieﬂy, blood samples were collected from 6
astronauts before, during, and after the spaceﬂight on the ISS. Total
RNA was puriﬁed from plasma samples and processed for RNA-seq
analysis. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read
counts of 6 astronauts for each time point.
Single-cell microgravity simulated in vitro PBMCs
Single-cell RNA-seq data was generated from donor PBMCs exposed to
simulated microgravity (μG) for 25 h, with a continual motion machine
(Rotating Wall Vessel) serving as an in vitro model for microgravity.
DEGs were calculated as μG vs. 1 G (control) for pooled data after two
donor sequencing reactions (one male and one female). Detailed
methods can be found in ref. 44.
Bulk RNA-sequencing from mouse tissues
All mouse RNA-sequencing datasets used were previously published
and are publicly available. Brown adipose tissue, kidney, liver, man-
dibular bone, spleen, temporal bone, thymus, white adipose tissue and
soleus were collected from mice that had spent 31 days on the ISS, two
days after returning to Earth87,88. A different group of soleus samples
were collected from mice that had spent 34.1 days in microgravity,
3.3 days after returning to Earth89. The tibialis anterior samples were
obtained from the Rodent Research-23 mission. Brieﬂy, mice were
maintained in microgravity for 38 days and were euthanized and dis-
sected after 24 hours from returning to Earth. A more thorough
description of the experimental design can be found at NASA GeneLab,
Doi: 10.26030/zw7z-bj40. Raw reads were trimmed galore, then
aligned using STAR2 alignment to mm10 or Salmon to Ensembl tran-
scripts. Gene counties were obtained using featurecounts. All RNAseq
differential expression analyses were performed using DESeq2(1.38.3)
in RStudio (R, 4.2.3). Heatmaps and volcano plots were produced using
the R packages ComplexHeatmap (2.15.1) and EnhancedVolcano
(1.16.0), respectively.
Compound analysis
FDA-approved drugs (n = 1692) are selected from the DrugBank data-
base and food compounds (n = 7962) are selected from the FoodDB
database. LINCS compounds (n = 5414) are obtained from LINCS
L1000 project. “Compound” is used as a general term for “drug”, “food
compound” and “LINCS compound” throughout the document.
Compound-protein interactions are extracted from the STITCH
database v5.069 by matching the InChI keys of drugs/food/LINCS

compounds. STITCH collects information from multiple sources and
individual scores from each source are combined into an overall con-
ﬁdence score. After processing, three data sets are obtained: i) drug-
gene interaction dataset containing 1890 drugs and 16,654 genes with
542,577 interactions ii) food compound - gene interaction dataset
containing 7,654 compounds and 116,375 genes and 818,737 interac-
tions iii) LINCS compound—gene interaction dataset containing 5414
compounds and 16,794 genes and 692,152 interactions. The universal
gene set contains all genes that interact with at least one compound.
The compound with low p-value interacts with a higher proportion of
the DEGs than that expected by chance. Statistically signiﬁcant com-
pounds were then obtained after Bonferroni adjustment of p values.
The pipeline for this compound analysis is implemented in the gcea R
package (https://github.com/nguyenkhiemv/gcea).
