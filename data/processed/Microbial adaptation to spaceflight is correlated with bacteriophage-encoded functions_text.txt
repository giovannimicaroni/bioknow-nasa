Microbial adaptation to spaceﬂight is
correlated with bacteriophage-encoded
functions

Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations
are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism
of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are proliﬁc mediators of
bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from
bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant
(lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are
signiﬁcantly different between spaceﬂight strains and their terrestrial coun-
terparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could
initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These
prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence
in extreme environments, such as spaceﬂight, to include antimicrobial resis-
tance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate
microbial adaptation in spaceﬂight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that
may impact human health in spaceﬂight.
Human space exploration is at a turning point. The push for long-
duration, crewed missions to the moon and beyond, coupled with the
emergence of commercial space tourism is redeﬁning the risks asso-
ciated with space travel. Adverse health effects due to host-
microorganism interactions is acknowledged by the NASA Human
Research Program, and currently this risk is accepted for short dura-
tion spaceﬂight. However, as ﬂight durations increase and the popu-
lation that experiences spaceﬂight expands beyond professional
astronauts, it is of increasing importance to understand the interplay
between microbial adaptation to the spaceﬂight environment (e.g.,
microgravity, ionizing radiation, altered host-microbe interactions,
etc.) and human health.
Microorganisms on the International Space Station (ISS) are
undergoing adaptation and host-mediated propagation throughout
the environment1–3. Studies to date suggest microbes on the ISS, pre-
dominantly derived from the crew microbiome, are enriched in func-
tions related to metal ion tolerance, dormancy, and antibiotic
resistance3,4. A primary mechanism by which bacteria adapt to novel
environments and stress is through genome plasticity, the ability to
uptake exogenous genetic material5. The presence of temperate
bacteriophages, or prophages, in bacterial genomes is one of the main
factors that enable genome plasticity6. The entrance of a phage into a
bacterial genome is performed through the process of lysogeny,
forming a “dormant” prophage containing the entirety of the bacter-
iophage DNA that is not actively bactericidal, but can undergo repli-
cation into a mature virus. These prophages can remain dormant for
extended periods of time, or switch into their active (lytic) state,
typically after intense DNA damage. Lytic phages can become bacter-
icidal and infect other bacterial cells, taking either their lytic or lyso-
genic state in their new host7.
Prophages dramatically alter their host’s physiology. The pre-
sence of prophages can disrupt and silence bacterial genes, and they
can cause chromosomal rearrangements, leading to changes in gene
expression in their bacterial host. Prophages can confer host immunity
to other bacteriophages, preventing lytic attack8. During the transition
to the lytic state, prophages can copy adjacent bacterial genes, inte-
grating them into the viral genome. This genetic material is transferred
to new bacterial hosts9. Examples of phage transduced functions
include virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, toxins, effector
proteins, and regulatory proteins8.

Prophages also affect microbial populations at the community
level. The introduction of bacteriophages into soil samples sig-
niﬁcantly changed the microbial composition and diversity of the soil
microbial community10. In aquatic environments, bacteriophage lyse
20–40% of bacterial biomass per day11. In mouse model studies, both
temperate and lytic phages inﬂuence the host gut microbiome, with
lytic phages leading to a more beneﬁcial community, and temperate
phages leading to dysbiosis12.
The role of bacteriophage in the adaptation of bacteria to the
spaceﬂight environment is unknown. Previous studies have high-
lighted the importance of microbial communities in spaceﬂight, with
changes noted in the composition of both the gut and skin micro-
biomes of astronauts13. While other studies have noted the presence of
prophages in a single bacteria species isolated from the ISS14,
in this work we show a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence
and characterization of prophage that inhabit the spacecraft-built
environment.
Results
Genome summary and sampling cadence and locations
The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment
consisting of 388 cubic meters of habitable space. Crew size has ran-
ged from 3 to 10 over the 22 years of continuous habitation. Surfaces
within the occupied modules have been continuously sampled and
analyzed for microbial populations to understand the microbiome of
the built spacecraft environment. We set out to analyze the genomes
that resulted from these experiments to assess the role of bacter-
iophage in the spacecraft-built environment.
We identiﬁed 10 bacterial strains of interest (see Methods):
Acinetobacter pittii, Bacillus amyloliquifaecins, Bacillus thuringiensis,
Enterobacter bugandensis, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Micrococcus
luteus, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Pseudomonas fulva, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. These 10 species
represent isolates from sampling campaigns spanning from 2006 to
2018 from eight locations within the ISS (Fig. 1) and a Crew Resupply
Vehicle while it was docked with the ISS. Overall, 245 spaceﬂight
genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes15 were included in our
analysis. A full table with links to genomes and data sources can be
found in Supplementary data 1.
Prophage region identiﬁcation and comparison
We extracted prophage regions from ﬂight genomes for each species
using PHASTER16,17 and summed the prophage regions identiﬁed
(categorized by PHASTER as complete, questionable, or incomplete),
as these region numbers are proportional to the number of prophages
that, at some point, lysogenized and entered the bacterial genome. For
comparison, we obtained all terrestrial, complete genomes for these
species from NCBI18 and determined the number of prophage regions
for these genomes (NCBI accessions can be found in Supplementary
data 1). Average number of prophage regions in the ﬂight genomes
ranged from 0.75 per genome for M. luteus to 7 for P. fulva (Fig. 2). For
M. luteus, 3 of the 8 ﬂight isolates had two possible incomplete
prophage regions per genome, but the PHASTER results suggested
they were low conﬁdence annotations and prophage analysis by
PhiSpy19, which employs more stringent criteria, did not identify any
prophage regions. Thus, M. luteus was removed from further analysis.
Of the nine remaining species, all had multiple incomplete prophage
regions and at least one complete phage, which, in theory, could
convert to a lytic phenotype. In addition, ﬁve species presented with
poly-lysogeny deﬁned as containing multiple complete prophages.
There were no universal trends in the number of prophage regions in
the ﬂight genomes versus the terrestrial isolates (Fig. 2), with four
species having signiﬁcantly more prophage in ﬂight genomes, four
with more in terrestrial, and one that was insigniﬁcant (Fig. 2,
Mann–Whitney, two-sided, p < 0.05).
Due to the consistency in ﬂight isolate prophage numbers for
most of the species investigated (Fig. 2), coupled with the sampling
cadence on the ISS (Supplementary data 1), we explored the genomic
diversity between the ﬂight isolates and the terrestrial strains. We used
a pangenome approach to compare the similarity within the ﬂight
strains for each species, compared to the pangenome for all strains of
the same species (all genomes in NCBI with an Assembly level at or
above scaffold). We deﬁned the core pangenome as genes present in at
least 90% of the genomes, with the remaining genes deﬁned as the
accessory pangenome. We looked at two metrics for our analysis. First,
we looked at the ratio in the size of the ﬂight-strain pangenome versus
the all-strain pangenome, working from the assumption that the more
similar the ﬂight strains, the larger the ﬂight-strain core genome.
Second, we took the fraction of the ﬂight-strain core pangenome
versus the total ﬂight-strain pangenome (core plus accessory), as the
smaller the accessory genome the less genetic diversity between the
ISS strains. For high-conﬁdence prophage regions (prophage calls
consistent between PHASTER and PhiSpy algorithms), we removed the
prophage regions from the genomes (replaced with N) to capture
phage-independent genome variability.
Flight strains for four of nine species (B. amyloliquifaeciens, K.
quasipneumoniae, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus) had a core
pangenome fraction of 0.90 or less (Supplementary data 1). The
accessory pangenome of the remaining ﬁve species was 3% or less of
the total pangenome, suggesting a high level of genetic similarity
between the ﬂight strains for these species. The ratio of the ﬂight
strains’ core pangenome versus the total species core pangenome was

larger for all species, as expected for strains continuously sampled
from the same environment. However, the magnitude of the ratio
mirrored the change in the core pangenome fraction with the K. qua-
sipneumoniae, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus ﬂight strains having
similarly sized core pangenome as the all-strain pangenome (1.06, 1.01,
and 1.03, respectively). S. epidermidis had the most longitudinal sam-
pling cadence with 30 separate samples taken over 12 years (Supple-
mentary data 1), which correlated with the highest level of genetic
diversity between ﬂight genomes (ﬂight versus all core ratio of 1.01 and
a ﬂight ISS core fraction of 0.54). However, there were no clear trends
in the pangenome comparison versus sampling cadence for the
remaining eight species. For example, the 21 ﬂight strains for A. pittii
were sampled across three campaigns, two of which were 3 years apart.
Still, these genomes showed the highest pangenome core ratio (1.21)
and a ﬂight core versus total pangenome fraction of 0.97, with only 89
genes in the accessory pangenome. S. saprophyticus’ 29 ﬂight genomes
came from a similar sampling cadence while having the second most
genetic diversity among ﬂight strains. The full genome diversity
comparison can be found in Supplementary data 1.
We then applied the pangenome approach to determine if pro-
phages contribute to variation between ﬂight and terrestrial strains of
the same species. Again, using all genomes in NCBI with an Assembly
level at or above scaffold, but not removing the high conﬁdence
prophage regions, we identiﬁed Clusters of Orthologous Groups
(COG) functions that were signiﬁcantly different (q value < 0.05)
between the ﬂight and terrestrial genomes. For both ﬂight and ter-
restrial genomes, there were signiﬁcant differences in gene clusters
associated with the phage-associated COG Mobilome (Fig. 3). Terres-
trial genomes were enriched for transposases across multiple species,
including A. pittii, B. thuringiensis, K. quasipneumoniae, and S. epi-
dermidis, compared to spaceﬂight genomes. Spaceﬂight genomes
were enriched for Mu-like phage structural proteins in A. pittii, E.
bugandensis, and P. fulva and enriched for general phage structural
proteins in A. pittii, E. bugandensis, K. quasipneumoniae, P. fulva, and S.
epidermidis. Only S. saprophyticus contained prophages that were not
signiﬁcantly different between ﬂight and terrestrial genomes. In
addition, A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaecins, B. thuringiensis, E. bugandensis,
and P. fulva indicated unique phage-associated gene clusters in both
ﬂight and terrestrial genomes suggesting a possible divergence in
prophage regions resulting from spaceﬂight.
Complete prophage classiﬁcation
To investigate the novelty of the ﬂight prophages, we analyzed the
complete prophage regions in comparison to known phage. In total,
283 complete prophage regions were identiﬁed in the 9 bacterial
species’ ﬂight genomes and all 283 were consistent between PHASTER
and PhiSpy, suggesting high conﬁdence prophage annotations. We
clustered these complete prophages into 71 bins of >90% similarity,
and determined the hypothetical phage family of each cluster by NCBI
nucleotide BLAST search [Megablast20] of viruses in the RefSeq Gen-
ome Database21 and the IMG Viral (VR) Database22. The IMG Viral
database was the more comprehensive of the two with an average
query identity score (nucleotide identity multiplied by alignment
percentage) of 55%, compared to 28% for the RefSeq viral genomes. Of
the 71 clusters, 11 were unclassiﬁed (15%) based on having a total query
identity of less than 40% with any phage in the RefSeq or IMG VR
Databases. Of the remaining 60 clusters, all complete prophages were
found to be tailed phages of class Caudoviricetes (Supplementary
data 1). Of these 71 intact prophage clusters, 21 could be classiﬁed as
novel species and 26 as novel genera based on current suggested
cutoffs of 95% query identity for species and 70% for genera23 (Fig. 4a).
Next, we determined the homology of the complete prophage
regions to bacterial genomes in the RefSeq database. As lysogenic
prophage regions are incorporated into the bacterial genome, homo-
logous regions may be present in terrestrial genomes in the bacterial
database. The average query identity increased from 55% in the viral
database to 80% with the bacterial database. Using the same cutoffs as
above, 21 of the 71 clusters would be considered novel at the 95% query
coverage cutoff and 16 would be considered novel at the 70% cutoff
(Fig. 4b). Of the nine species, only B. thuringiensis lacked a novel
complete prophage at the 70% cutoff (hereafter: non-redundant
prophage region), suggesting unique prophage-associated genomic
content was broadly observed in the ﬂight genomes (Table 1).
Finally, we attempted to elicit a lytic phenotype from the ﬂight
strains. Seven isolates from four different BSL1 species [B. amyloli-
quifaeciens (IIF7SC-B1 and IIF7SW-P4), P. fulva (F8_7S_9B), P. polymyxa
(IIF5SW-B4 and IIF8SW-P3), and S. saprophyticus (F6_7S_P5 and
F5_7S_P13)] were provided by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As

the phage induction mechanisms have not yet been explored in these
species, we subjected them to two common DNA damaging stimuli,
mitomycin C and UV exposure. For all strains, log-phase cultures
treated with mitomycin C (500, 100, 20, 4, and 0.8 ng mL−1) showed a
dose-response decrease in culture viability, as measured by OD600,
~8 h post-mitomycin C addition (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, cell
viability was more variable following UV-C radiation (254 nm; 5, 25, 50,
100, 200 J m−2). Both S. saprophyticus species showed dose-dependent
effect on the growth curve (b–c). This was similar to both B. amyloli-
quifaeciens isolates for the initial 12 h of growth, after which the growth
curves were indistinguishable between treatments, which coincided
with the formation of a bioﬁlm (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). The data for
P. polymyxa was inconclusive as this species’ bioﬁlm growth pheno-
type made it difﬁcult to standardize culture starting densities and
resulted in non-uniform light attenuation during OD600 determina-
tion (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g). P. fulva growth curves showed very
little change in response to UV expose, which may suggest enhanced
UV resistance in this ISS isolate (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
For all species with more than one isolate, the complete pro-
phages were identical in both strains, preventing us from testing for
bacteriophage infection via the soft-agar overlay method. Instead, we
attempted to purify phage particles post-mitomycin C addition via
ﬁltration (0.22 µm) and precipitation (8% PEG8000, 1 M NaCl). While
we were unable to recover phage particles, our attempt was cursory,
and a more comprehensive exploration of phage induction in these
isolates is needed.
Long-read assemblies provide insight into mobile genetic
elements
We explored the contribution of genome assembly level on the
prophage predictions by both the PHASTER and PhiSpy algorithms.
From the seven isolates we sequenced two strains, P. fulva F8_7S_9B
and S. saprophyticus F5_7S_P13, via Nanopore MinION. P. fulva was
chosen as all the spaceﬂight strains are poly-lysogenic with a non-
redundant prophage region in each strain (Cluster 52, Table 1). S.
saprophyticus F5_7S_P13 is a member of Cluster 41 containing a non-
redundant prophage region (Table 1).
Assemblies for both species resulted in a single contig for the
bacterial chromosome. S. saprophyticus F5_7S_P13 contained three

plasmids of 30, 33 and 36 kb in length. For this species, all ﬁve of the
short-read assembly prophage regions mapped to the long-read
assembly. However, one short-read incomplete prophage region was
missing in the long-read assembly PHASTER analysis, despite the entire
prophage region mapping to the long-read assembly (Supplementary
data 1). This prophage region was present in the PhiSpy prophage calls
for the long-read assembly. In addition, the long-read prophage ana-
lysis suggested the complete prophage from this species was trun-
cated in the short-read assembly (42.1 kb versus 56.2 kb). Interestingly,
the incomplete prophage #5 from the short-read prophage analysis
(Accession: NZ_JAFDPF010000007.1, sequence: 10127 to 19977) was
located on the 36 kb plasmid.
The prophage analysis for P. fulva F8_7S_9B suggested the short-
read assembly led to fragmented prophage analysis. The long-read
assembly identiﬁed 9 prophage regions, compared to 7 in the short-
read assembly, with one short-read incomplete prophage region
missing in the long-read assembly analysis (Supplementary data 1).
Similar to S. saprophyticus, the entire prophage region mapped to the
long-read assembly with no clear reason for its exclusion from the
PHASTER prophage calls. This prophage region was not identiﬁed by
PhiSpy in the long-read analysis. Long-read prophages #1, 5 and 6 were
absent in the short-read analysis due to the prophage regions being
split across separate contigs in the short-read assembly. Of the two
complete prophages in P. fulva F8_7S_9B, a 62.9 kb long-read prophage
region was split into two short-read prophage regions due to lying on
two adjacent contigs. The other complete prophage region was
annotated as a single 47.6 kb region in the long-read assembly but as
two prophage regions in the short-read assembly (intact: 35.6 kb and
incomplete: 12.1 kb region). The long-read assemblies can be found on
NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSD-582, DOI: 10.26030/v6s6-
w170) and NCBI (see Data Availability Statement).
Functional analysis of prophage region-encoded proteins
We selected a representative strain from each species and curated the
prophage-encoded bacterial gene annotations to assess the functional
contribution of phages to their hosts. Of the functionally annotated
content, 46% was uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins. Of the
remaining content, 20% was annotated as related to phage processes
such as structural proteins (e.g., capsid, tail, etc.), lysogeny, and phage
replication (e.g., integrases, terminases). The remaining content was
annotated as microbial proteins, conferring a variety of capabilities to
the host species (Fig. 5). The total number of prophage-encoded bac-
terial proteins that could be ascribed a function ranged from ~60 for
both Staphylococcus species to a high of 102 for E. bugandensis (707
total for all species). The most prominent functional category con-
tained proteins related to Signal Transduction and Transcriptional
Regulation (104 proteins across all species), followed by DNA Repair
and Replication (91 proteins), and Cell Wall Biogenesis and Degrada-
tion (65 proteins). To investigate the subset of prophage-encoded
proteins that provide unique capabilities to their host, we extracted
prophage-encoded annotations that lacked functional homology to
host genome-encoded proteins (Fig. 5). We computed a conservation
score for each category deﬁned as the fraction of prophage-encoded
proteins that were functionally unique. While only consisting of ﬁve
proteins across three species, Secretion Systems had the highest
conservation score of 1.0 (100% of the prophage-encoded proteins
conferred a unique capability to their host). Translation, Ribosomal
Structure and Biogenesis, as well as Lipid and Fatty Acid Metabolism
also had high conservation scores (0.9 for both categories). The pro-
minent prophage-encoded functional categories of Signal Transduc-
tion and Transcriptional Regulation, DNA Repair and Replication, and
Cell Wall Biogenesis and Degradation had conservation scores of 0.6,
0.51, and 0.48, respectively.
Many of the functions conferred by prophage-encoded proteins
are correlated to increased ﬁtness in competitive environments. All
nine species had putative virulence related genes encoded on proph-
age regions, with 45% of these conferring unique functions to their
hosts. Based on the assessment of antibiotic resistance genes using
ABRicate, P. polymyxa prophage contained an aminoglycoside resis-
tance gene (aadK), and S. epidermidis prophage contained two con-
ﬁrmed antibiotic resistance genes, a macrolide resistance gene
[mph(C)] and an efﬂux pump [msr(A)]. Approximately 33% of the
putative AMR proteins were possible resistance pumps for macro-
molecules. A. pittii, B. amyloliquifaeciens, and E. bugandensis all con-
tained prophage-encoded pyocin-related defense proteins. Both
Staphylococcus species contained prophage-encoded pathogenicity

island genes and enzymes associated with putative virulence or anti-
biotic resistance functions (Supplementary data 1). A. pittii, B. amylo-
liquifaeciens,
and
B.
thuringiensis
contained
prophage-encoded
enzymes for deoxynucleotide sugar biosynthesis found in both anti-
microbial biosynthetic pathways, such as streptomycin, as well as
polyketide biosynthesis related to pathogenicity and antimicrobial
activity24. These enzymes were unique to the prophage regions, with
no homologs found in the non-prophage host genomic content.
Additional prophage-encoded gene products may confer ﬁtness
in the built spacecraft environment. Stress response proteins included
those associated with sporulation and hibernation and metal resis-
tance genes and transporters. Both categories have been shown to be
enriched in spacecraft-associated microorganisms3. Four species had
prophage-encoded LexA-related transcriptional regulators or repres-
sors involved in the regulation of the SOS response in bacteria, which
have recently been shown to be uniquely present in ISS strains of A.
pittii25. This study also showed the presence of the RelBE toxin-
antitoxin system in ISS A. pittii strains, which is also prophage-
encoded.
Discussion
Prophages are cited to be the largest factor associated with strain
variation and diversity within terrestrial bacterial species5,7, which
holds in the spaceﬂight environment as phage-associated genes were
signiﬁcantly different in 8 of the 9 phage-containing species analyzed.
Several spaceﬂight species contained genes related to the production
of Mu-like phage proteins compared to their terrestrial counterparts.
Mu-like phages are unique in that they randomly integrate into the
host genome, increasing mutation rates and host gene disruption26.
Increased genetic diversity via Mu-like phage induced mutation may
assist in microbial adaptation to the spaceﬂight environment and
would explain the retention of these phage in ﬂight strains. In com-
parison, terrestrial genomes contained transposases absent in the
ﬂight strains. Transposases are common in dense populations where
there is rampant DNA sharing across a population of individuals27. The
absence of these transposase regions may be related to the nutrient
poor environment of the ISS. The presence of transposases in the
terrestrial organisms may also be indicative of active mobile genetic
elements, which we were unable to conﬁrm for the spaceﬂight isolates.
Our analysis suggested a high number of novel prophages in the
ﬂight genomes. In total, we identiﬁed 283 complete prophages making
up 71 unique prophage clusters, 18 of which were hypothesized as
novel, and host-related genes making up over a third of the genes
present in these prophage regions. While the discovery of novel pro-
phages is not uncommon, with viral dark matter reported to be
70–95% of human associated viromes28,29, a previous viral metage-
nomic study was able to classify the majority of the viruses in extreme
environments30.
Prophages are a primary mechanism of bacterial host gene
transfer, to include antibiotic resistance and virulence genes31. We
identiﬁed at least one putative antibiotic resistance or virulence host-
related gene within the prophage regions of all species studied. In

comparison, <12% of highly antibiotic resistant ESKAPE pathogens
carry a prophage-encoded antibiotic resistance gene32. In addition,
lysogens carrying antibiotic resistance genes have been shown to
provide a ﬁtness beneﬁt for their host31,33. There are several reports of
spaceﬂight-induced increases in antibiotic tolerance or increased
antibiotic resistance gene clusters14,25,34–36. With our identiﬁcation of
conﬁrmed antibiotic genes within prophage regions of P. polymyxa
and S. epidermidis, as well as the conservation of prophage regions
within members of the same species, we describe one possible
mechanism for this increased antibiotic tolerance.
We also identiﬁed categories of genes related to host immunity,
stress response, and DNA repair. The presence of prophages within a
bacterial host can provide immunity to attack from other bacter-
iophages or phage-like pyocins by inhibiting lytic phage replication, or
repressing other phages37,38. We identiﬁed several host immunity
genes in the ﬂight prophages that could mediate phage and pyocin
resistance. In addition, both Bacillus species contained prophage-
encoded sporulation genes, related to persistence in harsh terrestrial
environments39,40 and spaceﬂight3. Prophage-encoded DNA repair
genes were present across several species, notably those activated in
response to radiation. UV radiation induced activation of lytic phage is
well known; however, the ISS structure shields the interior from UV
radiation. The presence of DNA-repair genes may play a role in the
protection of the host genome from galactic cosmic rays or general
DNA damage from desiccation in the built environment41.
The association between genomic features enriched in ISS isolates
and prophage regions suggest phage are important for adaptation to
the spaceﬂight environment. However, these are correlations, and
experimentation is required to directly connect prophage-mediated
genetic plasticity with persistence in the built spacecraft environment.
In addition, the opportunity for phage infection of microbial strains
after they leave the crew microbiome is likely limited. Thus, an
important line of inquiry is to assess the lytic-lysogenic traits of
microorganisms while they are still host-associated.
Methods
Flight and terrestrial genomes
Candidate ﬂight species to use in our analysis were determined from
literature42–44. Isolates from the ISS were identiﬁed in the NCBI
databases18 by searching the BioSample database for “geo_loc_na-
me=USA: International Space Station”[attr] AND “SPECIES NAME”.
These hits were mapped back to the NCBI Assembly database and the
ﬂight genomes were validated and downloaded. The terrestrial gen-
omes were downloaded from the Assembly database with the follow-
ing conditions: Latest RefSeq only, Exclude anomalous and Taxonomy
Check Status OK. The Assembly Level differed based on analysis with
Scaffold and above used for pangenome analysis and Complete gen-
ome was used for prophage identiﬁcation. The Assembly Level for all
ISS ﬂight genomes were either Scaffold or Contig. Metagenomes were
downloaded from the NASA Open Science Data Repository OSD-69
(DOI: 10.26030/cary-q426)45. A full list of genomes, reference links and
sampling locations can be found in Supplementary data 1.
Prophage identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation
Prophage regions for both ISS and terrestrial isolates were identiﬁed
with PHASTER17. Results were separated into complete, questionable,
and incomplete prophage regions and the prophage regions in fasta
format were downloaded from the PHASTER web-based server. In
addition, ﬂight and terrestrial genomes, downloaded from NCBI using
E-utilities (v 1.77) in GenBank format, were also searched for prophage
regions using PhiSpy [v4.2.20,19] using default parameters. PhiSpy
prophage regions consistent with PHASTER prophage regions were
analyzed using ABRicate (v1.0.0, Seemann T, Abricate, Github https://
github.com/tseemann/abricate) with all associated databases46–53 to
identify antibiotic resistance genes in prophage regions. Fasta ﬁles of
the bacterial genomes without prophages were exported and used for
the ﬂight isolate genome diversity analysis. Prophage regions from ISS
strains were queried against the Virulence Factor Database (accessed
April 2023)53 to identify putative virulence factors using NCBI Blast20.
Statistical differences in prophage number were determined using a
two-tailed Mann–Whitney U rank test, correcting for ties, as imple-
mented in SciPy [v1.7.3,54]. The effect size was computed as
the common language effect size f value where f=
U
n1n2. The U-statistic
and f value were reported for the terrestrial condition. Prophage
regions identiﬁed as complete were clustered using MeShClust
[v3.0,55] with a cut off of 90% nucleotide identity. The nucleotide
sequence labeled as the center of each cluster was assessed for
homology with known viral and bacterial sequences in the NCBI
RefSeq genome database21 using BLAST [Megablast20, accessed
November 2022] and high conﬁdence genomes in the IMG/VR data-
base [v4.1, accessed July 202322]. Phage classiﬁcation was determined
based on the taxonomic similarity to the best hit in the viral database
(query coverage percentage multiplied by percent identity > 40%).
Pangenome analysis
Pangenome analysis of the ﬂight and terrestrial genomes from NCBI
and the NASA Open Science Data Repository56 was completed using
the pangenomics workﬂow57–59 in anvi’o [v7.160]. For Bacillus thur-
ingiensis, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis,
the terrestrial genomes were subsampled into sets of 300 genomes
and the pangenome workﬂow run separately on each subset (2 sets for
B. thuringiensis and K. quasipneumoniae each, and 3 sets for S. epi-
dermidis). For the ISS ﬂight genome diversity analysis, the non-
prophage containing bacterial genomes output from PhiSpy was used
for analysis. Outputs from the anvio-summarize function were parsed
for the number of genomes in which each gene was present. The core
pangenome was deﬁned as genes present in at least 90% of the gen-
omes (or for ISS species with less than 10 genomes, the cutoff was n-1
genomes, where n is the number of available genomes). The accessory
pangenome was deﬁned as the difference between the core pangen-
ome and the total number of genes in the pangenome. The core ratio
was the deﬁned as the number of genes in the ISS ﬂight core pan-
genome versus to all-strains (ISS and terrestrial) core pangenome. The
core pangenome fraction was deﬁned as the number of genes in the
core pangenome divided by the total pangenome size (core plus
accessory).
For the functional enrichment analysis, the full bacterial genome
with prophage regions was used for analysis. Functional enrichments
between ﬂight and terrestrial strains were determined using the built in
anvi-compute-functional-enrichments-in-pan
workﬂow59
with
COG20_FUNCTION as the annotation source. This workﬂow used the
two-tailed Rao test statistic to determine the signiﬁcance of a catego-
rical variable (in this case ﬂight versus terrestrial) to explain the func-
tional occurrence. The resulting p value was corrected for multiple
tests and reported as a q value, with a set signiﬁcance threshold of
q < 0.05. For species with subsampled genomes, a COG was considered
enriched if it was present at a q value (p value adjusted for multiple
tests) of 0.05 or lower for at least two subsets. Enrichment summaries
and outputs from the anvio-summarize script were used for down-
stream analysis.
Mitomycin C and UV treatment of ISS bacterial isolates
Flight isolates of Paenibacillus polymyxa (strains IIFSW-B4 and IIF8SW-
P3), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strains IIF7SW-P4 and IIF7SC-B1),
Pseudomonas fulva strain F8_7S_9B, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus
(strains F5_7S_P13 and F6_7S_P5) were provided by the Biotechnology
and Planetary Protection Group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
and grown overnight in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 30 °C. Cultures were
diluted to an OD600 of 0.3–0.4 and 4 mL was placed in a 30 mm
diameter plastic petri dish. With the lid removed, the cultures were

subjected to aggregate UV doses of 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 J m−2 of UV-
C radiation from a G30T8 UV lamp (75 µW cm−2 at the plate surface).
Doses were determined using a 2π UV-B/C light probe connected to a
hand-held light meter (ILT2400, International Light Technologies,
Peabody, MA, USA) in integrate mode. After each dose was delivered,
duplicate 200 µL aliquots were removed from the petri dish and placed
into separate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Cell growth was
determined by microplate reader optical measurements at 600 nm
once per hour (SpectraMax 340, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA,
USA). Negative control sample OD600 was subtracted from the time-
course culture data prior to analysis.
For the mitomycin C treatment, ﬂight isolates grown overnight
in TSB at 30 °C were diluted to 0.3–0.4 OD600 and 200 µL was
aliquoted into a 96-well plate. Mitomycin C stock solution in DMSO
(10 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was diluted to
110 µg/mL in TSB before being serial diluted ﬁve times at 5× dilution
in TSB. 5 µL of these dilutions, along with a TSB control, were added
to separate wells of the culture-containing 96-well plate (2 technical
replicates per isolate) resulting in a ﬁnal concentration set of 500,
100, 20, 4, 0.8, and 0.0 ng mL−1. Cell growth was determined by
microplate reader optical measurements at 600 nm once per hour
(SpectraMax 340, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Negative
control sample OD600 was subtracted from the time-course culture
data prior to analysis.
For phage isolation attempts, 5 mL of cultures were grown to mid-
log phase before being treated with mitomycin C (0.5 µg/mL ﬁnal
concentration). Cultures were returned to the 30 °C incubator over-
night. Cells and debris were removed by centrifugation and the
supernatant was ﬁltered through a low-protein binding 0.22 µm PES
syringe ﬁlter. To the clariﬁed supernatant, a PEG8000, NaCl stock
solution was added to yield a ﬁnal concentration of 8% PEG8000, 1 M
NaCl. Solutions were incubated overnight at 4 °C, transferred to tri-
plicate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 15 000 × g for
30 min at4 °C. Tubes were visually examined for the presence of phage
pellets.
Long-read genome sequencing of bacterial isolates
Flight isolates of Paenibacillus polymyxa (strains IIFSW-B4 and IIF8SW-
P3), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strains IIF7SW-P4 and IIF7SC-B1),
Pseudomonas fulva strain F8_7S_9B, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus
(strains F5_7S_P13 and F6_7S_P5) were grown on tryptic soy agar plates.
After 72 h the plates were scraped and biomass was suspended in 1 mL
of buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0), and genomic DNA
was extracted via a lysozyme, proteinase K treatment followed by
phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation as outlined
in61. DNA quality was assessed by ﬂuorometric quantiﬁcation (Qubit,
Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and UV-Vis microvolume spectro-
photometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA,
USA). Paenibacillus polymyxa and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, as well as
Staphylococcus saprophyticus F5_7S_P13, were excluded from the
sequencing run due to bioﬁlm polysaccharides preventing extraction
of gDNA with sufﬁcient purity for MinION sequencing. All gDNA
manipulations were performed using wide-bore pipet tips to prevent
genomic DNA (gDNA) shearing. Native gDNA was sequenced on a
MinION R9.4 ﬂowcell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford,
UK). The sequencing library was prepared using the ONT Rapid Bar-
coding Sequencing kit (SQK-RBK004, Oxford Nanopore Technologies,
Oxford, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing
Fast5 ﬁles were base-called using the ONT Guppy base-caller (v6.2.1)
using the super high accuracy model. Genomes were assembled using
Flye [v2.9.162] and polished with the ONT tool Medaka (v1.7.0, https://
github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) using default parameters for
both. Closed contigs were checked for prophage regions using the
PHASTER web-based interface as outlined above.
Functional annotation of prophage regions
Open reading frames encoded within the prophage nucleotide
sequences from the PHASTER output were determined using the NCBI
ORFinder18. Open reading frames were annotated using Microbe-
Annotator
[2.0.5,63],
using
DIAMOND
search
for
homology
determination58. The output ﬁle was combined with the E values for the
homology scores and any E value higher than 1 × 10−40 was ﬂagged for
manual curation. Proteins ﬂagged for manual curation were compiled
into a single ﬁle in fasta format and searched against the NCBI RefSeq
database. The results were curated for accuracy and conﬁdence and
the annotation added to the summary ﬁle. All annotations in the
summary ﬁle were then manually assigned to one of 21 categories
based on their functional annotation.
All data visualization was performed using in Python (v3.9) using
Jupyter Notebooks [v1.0.0,64] and the packages Matplotlib [v3.5.1,65]
and Seaborn [v0.11.2,66]. Additional packages used for analysis inclu-
ded NumPy [v1.22.3,67], Pandas [v1.4.2,68,69], and Biopython [1.79,70]. No
custom code, algorithms, or scripts central to the research were
generated.
