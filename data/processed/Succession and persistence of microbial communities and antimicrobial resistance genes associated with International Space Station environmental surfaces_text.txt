Following publication of the original article [1], the au-
thors reported a typographic error in scientific notation
in the number of reads, the text should read as:
“Approximately 7.3 × 108 reads associated with micro-
organisms were generated after high quality trimming
from PMA (21 samples) and non-PMA treated (21 sam-
ples) samples. All metagenomics reads were normalized
across all samples, which yielded 3.1 × 108 in total, and
7.4 × 106 assigned to each sample, without affecting the
taxonomic diversity.”
The authors regret these errors and the inconvenience
caused.
