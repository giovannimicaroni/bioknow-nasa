The advent of civilian spaceﬂight challenges scientists to precisely describe the
effects of spaceﬂight on human physiology, particularly at the molecular and
cellular level. Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantita-
tively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule
resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore
sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood
sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven
timepoints, spanning pre-ﬂight, day of return, and post-ﬂight recovery. We
report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation,
stress induction, and immune changes affected by spaceﬂight. We also present
the ﬁrst m6A methylation proﬁles for a human space mission, suggesting a
signiﬁcant spike in m6A levels immediately post-ﬂight. These data and results
represent the ﬁrst longitudinal long-read RNA proﬁles and RNA modiﬁcation
maps for each gene for astronauts, improving our understanding of the human
transcriptome’s dynamic response to spaceﬂight.
Both short- and long-term missions into space are correlated with a
variety of acute physiological effects, affecting diverse organ and cel-
lular
systems1–3.

impairment in a wide variety of activities post-spaceﬂight, requiring
reconditioning routines to regain preﬂight performance4. Signiﬁcant
changes also occur within the circulatory and hematological system
during spaceﬂight, on both a molecular and physiological level, which
likely contributes to these effects5. Ground studies collecting tran-
scriptomic proﬁles of human subjects have attempted to characterize
the impact of individual components of spaceﬂight, such as radiation
or microgravity exposure6,7, the latter being simulated with a parabolic
ﬂight8. With regard to direct spaceﬂight exposure, the available tran-
scriptomic data is even more limited, focused on a few speciﬁc assays,
either sequencing the human IgM repertoire following long-term
spaceﬂight9, measuring the proteome of exhaled breath condensate
after long-term spaceﬂight10, or examining gene expression proﬁles
from astronaut hair follicle samples after long stays on the Interna-
tional Space Station11. However, beyond this limited work, there is
scant data on the impact of human spaceﬂight on the transcriptome
beyond the NASA Twins Study (1-year mission), and almost no data
from short-duration missions. Moreover, there are no single-molecule,
direct RNA datasets from astronauts, which can help detail changes in

RNA methylation and base modiﬁcations while also capturing
expression and isoform changes.
To address this gap in transcriptome knowledge, eleven different
biospecimen types underwent four types of high-throughput sequen-
cing for each of the four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4)
mission12, including genomics, transcriptomics, immune proﬁles,
microbiome, and some clinical blood tests13. Long read sequencing
(LRS) technologies have potentially relevant clinical applications14,
since they can capture both splicing and expression differences in full-
length transcripts; nanopore long-read direct-RNA sequencing15 is
additionally
advantageous
since
it
provides
per-base
epitran-
scriptomic data (e.g., m6A modiﬁcation sites)16. Here, we generated
LRS samples taken before the ﬂight (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), the day of
landing (R + 1), and in recovery periods (R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days)
after a 3-day spaceﬂight from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. A bat-
tery of computational and analytical approaches were deployed on
these samples, including edgeR, DESeq2, ONT tools, Gene set co-
regulation analysis (GESECA)17–19, as well as orthogonal sequencing on
the Ultima UG100 platform, which generated an average of 413 million
reads per sample. These data provided an opportunity to discern the
utility of LRS technologies in studying the I4, as well as future astronaut
cohorts, and will also enable meta-analyses in conjunction with other
NASA Open Science Data Repository (NASA OSDR, https://osdr.nasa.
gov/) short-read and single-cell data sets.
We present these data sets and algorithmic methods as founda-
tional functional genomics resources for human spaceﬂight, as part of
a roadmap for future bioinformatics data analysis techniques for LRS
data. These current results are in line with the mission of NASA OSDR,
which aims to standardize procedures for future spaceﬂight missions
and open science, enabling comprehensive comparisons between
these astronaut and model cohorts20. We also implemented meth-
odologies which allow for examination of differences in expression,
splicing behavior, and methylation (m6A) at the same time. As such, we
can observe molecular changes underlying blood transcriptome
dynamics across an astronaut’s journey to space and back, which show
thousands of changes across several hundred speciﬁc genes, some of
which recapitulate known stress markers of the vasculature and
immune system, as well as signatures of m6A changes, isoform
switching, and hematopoiesis regulation that appear upon landing
back on Earth.
Results
Differential gene expression and gene set co-regulation analyses
reveal genes and pathways associated with the effects of short-
term space ﬂight
We evaluated two distinct approaches to gene expression quantiﬁca-
tion and detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the
direct RNA data (see “Methods”). First, the raw basecalled reads were
processed with the pipeline maintained by Oxford Nanopore Tech-
nologies (ONT), pipeline-transcriptome-de21; the pipeline considers
reads aligned to the Gencode v41 transcriptomic reference22, includes
multi-mapping reads, quantiﬁes expression based on individual tran-
scripts, collapses transcript counts into gene counts, and obtains sets
of DEGs using the edgeR package17. In addition, we quantiﬁed
expression based on reads aligned to the human genome reference
hg3823 using the subread package24, excluding multi-mapping reads,
and obtained sets of DEGs via the SARTools package25, a wrapper for
DESeq218. Both pipelines were applied to the data in the context of
multiple ﬂight, recovery, and longitudinal proﬁles (Supplementary
Data 1). A full ﬂow cell was used for each astronaut and time-point; the
four astronauts were grouped together as biological replicates for
downstream analysis. All runs aligned more than 400,000 long-reads,
with an average length of 580 base pairs. While the two computational
approaches produced results that slightly differed in DEGs determined
to be signiﬁcant (DESeq2 or edgeR p value < 0.05) (Supplementary
Data 2), they overwhelmingly agreed on their relative abundance
estimates for gene quantiﬁcation (median Pearson’s r = 0.98, Fig. 1a)
and the direction of their change in all proﬁles (Fig. 1b).
Next, gene set co-regulation analysis (GESECA)19 was used to
examine changes in known pathways and molecular functions
(MSigDb category C2, curated gene sets)26,27, speciﬁcally for those
pathways deviating from the baseline value (median z-scored expres-
sion of associated genes +1.86, Supplementary Data 3) at the R + 1
timepoint (immediately post-ﬂight). The variation of 789 out of the
6336 assessed pathways was signiﬁcantly co-regulated (adjusted p
value < 0.05). Although 2829 downregulated genes were present at
R + 1 (z-score below 0), the vast majority of signiﬁcantly variable
pathways was driven by upregulated genes (z-score above 0, Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). Top variable pathways included erythrocyte CO2 and
O2 takeup and release, as well as the Biocarta AHSP pathway (hemo-
globin’s chaperone; a superset of the erythrocyte-associated path-
ways) (Fig. 2). Longitudinal changes for the identiﬁed differentially
enriched pathways showed two distinct trends (Supplementary Data 3,
value of dz); the trend was either disrupted immediately following
space ﬂight (Fig. 3a) or was continued from pre-ﬂight before returning
to baseline in recovery (Fig. 3b). While most altered heme pathways
were marked by increased expression of genes when returning to
Earth, two pathways for erythrocytes showed distinct responses.
Speciﬁcally, the data demonstrated both a decrease in erythrocyte-
associated pathways for erythrocyte CO2 and O2 takeup (and release),
as well as an increase in Steiner membrane genes, which indicates the
signiﬁcant spaceﬂight-induced stress on erythrocytes in particular.
Transcription factor enrichment analysis was then utilized to
identify commonly shared transcription factors by genes (Supple-
mentary Data 4) across all time points. The top three suggested reg-
ulators, based on a combined CHIP-seq and co-expression analysis,
KLF1, GATA1, and TAL1 are all key transcription factors (TFs) for ery-
throcyte differentiation28–30, underscoring the changes in these cell
types and also suggesting possible TF-based drivers for the trends
observed within the GESECA analysis.
m6A modiﬁcation analysis identiﬁes sites of differential long-
itudinal methylation
Next, we identiﬁed the sites of m6A modiﬁcation across isoforms31 and
their degree of change, leveraging the single molecular nature of the
ONT platform to ﬁnd sites differentially methylated across the pre-
ﬂight, recovery, and longitudinal post-ﬂight proﬁles (q value < 0.01,
methylKit32) (Supplementary Data 5). This analysis showed 1190 m6A
modiﬁcation sites with statistically signiﬁcant differences for at least
one particular longitudinal comparison. The signiﬁcant sites were
annotated to 200 total transcripts, sourced from 193 gene loci. Nota-
bly, the largest set of differentially methylated positions occurred on
the day of returning back to Earth (timepoint R + 1 compared to all pre-
ﬂight timepoints), which we correlated with the variability of pathways
identiﬁed by GESECA. Per pathway, the number of differentially
methylated sites per gene ranged from 0 to 4.4 (Fig. 4a). Among the
pathways with the highest density of differentially methylated sites,
once again the erythrocyte-associated pathways were enriched, as well
as their superset, the Biocarta alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein
(AHSP) pathway (Fig. 4b).
Comparing the 193 gene loci which contained DRACH (D = A, G or
U; H = A, C or U) sequence motifs33 with differentially methylated sites
(minimum 20x coverage, q value < 0.01, methylKit) with the set of 440
differentially expressed gene loci (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.05, either
salmon or SARTools), we found an overlap of 53 genes, indicating that
most of the post-transcriptional m6A regulation is distinct from the set
of DEGs. When individual genes were considered, the genes with the
highest number of differentially methylated sites did not contribute to
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed pathways, but among the top 30
such genes, 11 were part of the HSIAO_HOUSEKEEPING_GENES pathway

(Supplementary Fig. 2), and included genes for alpha-globin (HBA),
beta-globin (HBB), and also human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles.
These data indicate the transcription levels of the genes responding to
spaceﬂight are distinct from their speciﬁc RNA modiﬁcations, and that
this is consistent across the immune and hematopoietic-related
pathways.
We next examined the m6A differences observed within the
ﬂight proﬁle (FP) and return proﬁle (RP) comparisons (FP1, RP1, and
RP2, deﬁned in Supplementary Data 1). Overall, 331 positions were
hypermethylated (q value < 0.01, methylKit) and, among these,
seven genes (PFN1, LAPTM5, RPS4X, HBA1, MT-ND4, HBA2, HBA2.1)
demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant downregulation in methy-
lation 45 days after landing (q value < 0.01, methylKit). An additional
two transcripts (MT-ND1, MT-RNR1) demonstrated a statistically
signiﬁcant downregulation 82 days after landing (q value < 0.01,
methylKit). 208 positions were noted to contain decreased levels of
m6A (q value < 0.01, methylKit). Amongst these, one (SLC25A37)
position demonstrated increased methylation 45 days after landing
(q value < 0.01, methylKit). No additional positions demonstrated
increased methylation (q value < 0.01, methylKit) in the long-term
follow-up timepoints, which indicates that spaceﬂight has its most
signiﬁcant effect on m6A methylation levels in the days immediately
following return to Earth.
De novo transcriptome analysis reveals uniquely expressed
transcripts at L-92, L-3, R + 1 and R + 194
De novo transcriptome analysis was then utilized to reveal transcripts
unique to particular time points. Unlike differential expression analy-
sis, which captures differences across timepoints based on known
annotations, de novo transcriptome analysis captures unannotated
transcript variants speciﬁc to a particular timepoint or sample type.
Ignoring loci not detected within the samples, we note that the overall
sensitivity
of
the
full
transcript-level
analysis,
as
deﬁned
by
GffCompare34, is on average 8.5%, revealing 3’ enrichment of many
reads (Supplementary Data 6), which is expected given the polyA-
priming protocol. One particular sample (November for the C003
astronaut) had lower coverage, leading to the exclusion of this time
point from subsequent analysis. Additionally, when ignoring com-
pletely unannotated putative transcripts, we report that the average
precision, as deﬁned by GffCompare, was 52.4% (Supplementary
Data 6). We focused on transcripts found consistently across all crew
members for subsequent de novo analyses.

The transcripts were then analyzed in the context of two over-
lapping time periods: (1) the period leading up to the space ﬂight and
return; and (2) the period starting with spaceﬂight and leading into
post-ﬂight recovery. Therefore, ﬁrst, the set of samples consisting of
preﬂight and return timepoints (L-92, L-44, L-3, and R + 1) was exam-
ined. There were eight unique transcripts for L-92 (Supplementary
Data 8: June), no unique transcripts for L-44 (Supplementary Data 8:
August), seven unique transcripts for L-3 (Supplementary Data 8:
September Pre-Flight) and six unique transcripts for R + 1 (Supple-
mentary Data 8: September Post-Flight, top). In the set of samples
consisting of return and recovery timepoints (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, and
R + 194), there were ﬁve unique transcripts for R + 1 (Supplementary
Data 8: September Post-Flight, bottom), one unique transcript for
R + 82 (Supplementary Data 8: December) and no unique transcripts
for R + 194 (Supplementary Data 8: March). These unique RNAs
represent perhaps a very speciﬁc response to spaceﬂight, which have
not been observed in previous studies.
Since spaceﬂight can introduce changes in differential expression
and methylation, we next examined if the stress could also lead to
aberrant splicing. Each transcript was assigned a GffCompare tran-
script classiﬁcation code, which represents the detection of intron
retention or other changes in isoform state34. The i4 transcriptome
data showed six transcripts with complete intron chain retention (“=”
label), nine transcripts with intron chain retention over a segment (“c”
label), one transcript with single intron retention (“n” label), ﬁve
transcripts characterized by a unannotated intron (“j” label), one
transcript with a single exon fragment partially covering an intronic
region (“e” label), two transcripts with unannotated exons (“o” label),
and three transcripts entirely unannotated and not found in any
reference transcriptome (“u” label). These results (Supplementary
Data 8) show the capacity for novel isoform state and discovery in the
direct RNA-seq data.
Of note, we also identiﬁed two transcripts which could be
uniquely associated with the R + 1 timepoint (Supplementary Data 8),
and downregulated during the recovery phase upon returning to
Earth. The ﬁrst of these was ENST00000686344.2, within the
ENSG00000274015 gene locus, located on chr14 between coordinates
63,642,035 and 63,665,593, which is an uncharacterized lncRNA
annotation. The second is a completely novel, unannotated putative
transcript variant, described by the “u” GffCompare transcript classi-
ﬁcation code34, located on chromosome 10 between coordinates
3,408,655 and 3,409,052 (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To conﬁrm these isoforms, we performed deep RNA-seq on the
same whole blood samples using the Ultima Genomics UG100 system.
The platform generated an average of 411.5 million reads per sample,
with a mapping percentage greater than 90% for all samples (Supple-
mentary Data 6). As a result, an average of 28,438 genes were detected,
with close correspondence between all samples (Fig. 5A). When

comparing the nanopore quantiﬁcation of gene expression proﬁles to
the Ultima data, we observed fair correlation (R2 > 0.56–0.71) with the
UG100 platform (Fig. 5B). We determined that 23/25 (92%) of the time
point speciﬁc genomic loci demonstrated a consistent pattern of cDNA
read alignments (Supplementary Data 6). While this did not include the
transcript variant on chromosome 10 within Supplementary Fig. 3, we

Discussion
All prior transcriptomics data from spaceﬂight studies have used
short-read sequencing14, and these LRS data showed a unique sig-
nature of disrupted gene regulation for astronauts from the Inspira-
tion4 mission, particularly in the hematological system. These data
provide the ﬁrst map of m6A changes from spaceﬂight, which showed
their largest degree of changes on the day of landing (R + 1)15,16. The
majority of signiﬁcantly altered pathways was driven by upregulated
genes, implying that transcriptional and pathway activity went into
ﬁgurative “overdrive” following the short-term, high-elevation space
ﬂight. This signiﬁcant shift in the expression proﬁle may be explained
by both direct and indirect effects of spaceﬂight, such as radiation,
changes in gravity, circadian rhythm disruptions, mission stress, and
possibly medications, although none were indicated by the crew
records. The direct-RNA sequencing data also detailed splicing events
for isoforms, while conﬁrming that aberrant splicing in the crew was
very low overall.
Although many categories of signiﬁcantly up-regulated pathways
were observed, exposure to space radiation in particular may underlie
a number of cancer-related pathways, including “TSAI response to
radiation therapy” and “Wiemann telomere shortening and chronic
liver damage.” The set of downregulated pathways after landing was
distinct, and notably included genes associated with breathing reg-
ulation (e.g., CO2 and O2 takeup and release by erythrocytes). These
pathways were also among the top differentially methylated, sug-
gesting a potential convergence between expression and methylation
in regulating these critical functions. These results also mirror
reported effects of partial gravity and microgravity on lung function,
and spaceﬂight-related hypercapnia linked to increased CO2 levels35,36.
Future studies should consider the impact of air quality, convection,
and microgravity-related pulmonary challenges for expression and
methylation differences. Also, while these samples had to be
sequenced on Earth, the development of space-speciﬁc, microgravity-
compatible sequencing protocols37,38 foreshadows the exciting possi-
bility of real-time monitoring of changes of the transcriptome and
epitranscriptome for future missions. Moreover, radiation levels
should continue to be monitored during missions, since such stressors
can alter telomere dynamics, which have been observed before in the
NASA Twins Study39,40 and for mountaineers climbing Mt. Everest25.
In addition to capturing differential expression, LRS technologies
also capture transcript splicing, potentially allowing for the identiﬁ-
cation of new regulatory mechanisms and interactions between these
two modalities of RNA41. In fact, a recent study examining murine
skeletal muscle post-spaceﬂight found that differential splicing
accounted for more variation than differential expression42. LRS can
potentially identify all such differences, given that the nearly all tran-
scripts are shorter than the theoretical maximum sequencing length
for Nanopore platforms (2.3 Mb)43,44. Nevertheless, limitations remain
within the library preparation and technical speciﬁcations (e.g., 3’
enrichment) of different LRS platforms43, and improvements in these
protocols and informatics methods will help proﬁling for future
samples.
To gain greater conﬁdence in the DEG set, we compared two
different approaches to multi-mapping reads and DEG detection.
Namely, secondary mappings are not included in the featureCounts
quantiﬁcation, whereas secondary mappings contribute partial counts
in salmon, and are likely the source of differences in assigning the
counts to three closely homologous genes DEFA1/1B/3 (Fig. 2c). Addi-
tionally, the associated differential expression callers, DESeq2 and
edgeR, respectively, utilize slightly different heuristics to perform log2
fold change estimates, resulting in many genes uniquely identiﬁed by
the salmon-edgeR pipeline mapping to the y-axis of Fig. 1b. While
accounting for secondary mappings with salmon could be argued to
be the more sound approach, this calls for further assessment and

discussion of methods to be used for analyses of direct-RNA data, as
retention of secondary mappings is incompatible with m6A callers such
as m6anet, which was recently shown to be the most accurate m6A
caller45. Despite these differences attributed to isoforms, we none-
theless have found that both methods produced similar quantiﬁcation
results, with high correlation (>0.98), and their per-gene averages were
used for gene set co-regulation analyses (GESECA). When the sig-
niﬁcance of differential expression of individual genes is to be con-
sidered, intersecting the gene sets reported by DESeq2 and edgeR was
preferred.
A current limitation speciﬁc to nanopore LRS is the loss of cov-
erage at the 5’ end of transcripts, since the assay uses polyA-trail
priming46,47. As expected, we observed this truncation, resulting in
lower sensitivity for some reference transcripts (Supplementary
Data 6). It has also been suggested that future improvements in the
Nanopore hardware will address this limitation48. To minimize this
issue, those with other classiﬁcation codes were restricted to those
events observed across all crew members and all timepoints, and thus
likely represent real biological variation. Moreover, we veriﬁed the
associated transcripts with orthogonal data from the Ultima Genomics
UG100 platform. While these samples provide remarkable coverage,
further comparative analysis is necessary to optimize the application
of current differential expression models. Also, transcript-speciﬁc and
functional follow-up assays are necessary to determine the potential
signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings and potential use of these transcripts as
biomarkers, as well as additional data from other crews and missions.
Moreover, given the civilian background of the I4 astronauts, we note
that transcriptomic changes can be confounded with age, biological
sex, preﬂight preparation differences, or divergent postﬂight recovery
procedures, and thus utilized tools that aim to model and normalize
such variation.
Finally, given the recently proposed missions with private
(SpaceX, Axiom, Sierra Space) and public (NASA, ESA, and JAXA)
space entities, there will be continued opportunities to replicate
these ﬁndings and to continue to discover new features of the
transcriptome. This will include continued mapping of space-
related
gene
expression
responses,
m6A
site
changes,
and
isoform-switching events that are associated with spaceﬂight. Also,
in-ﬂight testing of direct RNA sequencing has been demonstrated
on the ISS, which indicates that LRS of RNA could also be applied for
crew studies in future missions, including for blood, microbial, and
environmental samples. Optimization and deployment of these
single molecule technologies can also aid in the plans for lunar
laboratories, in-ﬂight clinical diagnostics, and the ability to discover
non-canonical bases or new base modiﬁcations for lunar and
exploration-class (e.g., Mars) missions.

Direct RNA sequencing
Total RNA was processed and sequenced as described in Collection
of Biospecimens from the Inspiration4 Mission Establishes the
Standards for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)12. Brieﬂy,
total RNA was isolated using the direct-RNA kit (Oxford Nanopore
Technologies) from whole blood samples from three pre-ﬂight time
points L-92, L-44, L-3, one post-ﬂight time point R + 1, and three
recovery period time points R + 45, R + 82, and R + 194. Basecalling
was performed with Guppy version 6.2.1, and alignment of raw
nanopore events to the basecalled sequences was done with the f5c
module eventalign version 1.149. Quality assessment was performed
with pycoQC version 2.5.0.2150 and MultiQC version 1.13.dev051
(Supplementary Data 7).
Differential gene expression analysis
The reads were aligned to the Gencode v41 human transcriptomic
reference22 with minimap2 version 2.24-r112252. First, the pipeline
maintained
by
Oxford
Nanopore
Technologies,
pipeline-
transcriptome-de21, was used to quantify transcripts and to subse-
quently
perform
the
differential
expression
analysis.
pipeline-
transcriptome-de
performs
the
quantiﬁcation
with
salmon53,
accounting for multi-mapping reads; therefore, we included the
highest-scoring secondary minimap2 alignments (minimap2 switch
-p1.0) in the input for the pipeline. Additionally, the sub-2Kbp read
lengths (median length between 517 and 1331, with one outlier of 279,
Supplementary Data 7) were insufﬁcient to perform differential tran-
script usage analyses47, and we focused on the differential gene
expression results, which pipeline-transcriptome-de generates with
edgeR17 while collapsing transcripts into respective genes.
On the other hand, however, we also planned to perform differ-
ential methylation analyses, and tools that detect m6A modiﬁcations,
such as m6anet31, require that secondary alignments be ﬁltered out. To
(1) match the input requirements of m6anet that prohibit multi-
mapping reads, (2) compare the collapsed edgeR results to a pipeline
that performs gene quantiﬁcation by design, and (3) assess the effect
of aligning reads to the whole genome rather than to the tran-
scriptome, we separately aligned the reads to the human reference
genome hg3823 with minimap2 with the parameters recommended for
direct-RNA data, retaining only the primary mappings (-x splice -uf -k14
--secondary=no). We thereafter processed these data with the subread
module featureCounts version 2.0.124 to perform gene quantiﬁcation,
and subsequently analyzed differential expression with SARTools
version 1.8.125, a package wrapping DESeq2 version 1.36.018. As DESeq2
and edgeR employ different approaches to log2(FoldChange) shrink-
age, the determination of signiﬁcance was based solely on the mag-
nitude of the p values reported by both; only the genes that were
identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly differentially expressed by both tools (FDR-
adjusted p value < 0.05) were considered as such. Covariates to
account for inter-astronaut variability were included when performing
both DESeq2 and edgeR analysis. For comparisons where multiple
time-points were grouped as either preﬂight or postﬂight, each
sequence run was treated as an independent replicate.
Gene set co-regulation analysis
Given high correlation of results between featureCounts and sal-
mon, per-gene counts were averaged between the two tools. These
values, normalized by library size, were supplied to GESECA19, and
co-regulation of MSigDb C2 pathways (curated gene sets)26,27 was
inferred. Pathways were deemed signiﬁcantly variable if the repor-
ted adjusted p value fell below 0.05. For each signiﬁcantly variable
pathway and at each timepoint, the median z-scored expression
value of genes in the pathway was calculated. Next, to determine the
pattern in the pathway variability upon return from spaceﬂight, per
pathway, we ﬁtted a linear regression on the median z-scores at pre-
ﬂight timepoints as a time series (i.e., values of −92, −44, −3),
obtained a prediction of the z-score at the return timepoint (+1) and
calculated a value, dz, of how much the observed value at R + 1
differed from the predicted value; examples of this approach are
illustrated on Fig. 3. The pathways were ranked by this value, from
highest (most disrupted by spaceﬂight) to lowest (continuing a pre-
ﬂight trend).

Transcription factor enrichment analysis
Gene annotations within Supplementary Data 2 were converted to
gene
names
utilizing
gProﬁler
(https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gproﬁler/
convert)54. The resulting gene list was input into the ChEA3 digital
web server (https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/)55. The mean rank results
were exported and reported in Supplementary Table 4.
m6A modiﬁcation analysis
The transcriptomic alignments were ﬁltered to retain primary map-
pings only (minimap2 switch --secondary=no) to match the input
requirements of m6anet. m6anet version 1.1.0 was then employed to
annotate sites of m6A modiﬁcations with methylation probabilities,
and methylKit version 0.99.232 was used to discover differentially
methylated sites between conditions in all proﬁles; sites were deemed
signiﬁcant if the resultant methylKit q value fell below 0.01, as
recommended by the tool’s authors.
De novo transcriptome analysis
The genomic alignments were collapsed with StringTie version 2.2.156
and compared with GffCompare version 0.11.234. The GffCompare.-
tracking ﬁle was further processed in R version 4.2.1/RStudio version
1.2.5001. Average read length was calculated with samtools version
1.16.157. The R + 45 timepoint was excluded since the sample for subject
C003 exhibited a low average read length (279 bp) and transcript-level
precision (Supplementary Data 7).
Ultima genomics deep-RNA sequencing
Poly-A mRNA was isolated from approximately 50–500 ng of total
RNA using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module
(New England Biolabs). The resulting mRNA was converted into
cDNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit
(New England Biolabs). After end repair/dA-tailing, adapter ligation,
and USER-enzyme digestion, indexing PCR was carried out using the
UG Library Ampliﬁcation Kit (Ultima Genomics) with custom
indexing
primers
that
amplify
the
TruSeq
Read1
and
Read
2 sequences, but are appended with Ultima Genomics adapter
sequences. After 11 cycles of PCR, ampliﬁcation products were
cleaned up using a 1.0x ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coul-
ter). Overhang generation was carried out using components from
the UG Library Ampliﬁcation Kit (Ultima Genomics) and material was
size selected using a dsSPRI approach with 0.6x/0.85x AMPure XP
beads. Quality control of the resulting libraries was carried out using
the DNA High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer Reagents (Agilent Technolo-
gies) and concentrations were measured via Qubit HS DNA Quanti-
ﬁcation Kit (Thermo Fisher). Sample pools were then seeded onto
UG sequencing beads, pre-enriched, and ampliﬁed by emulsion PCR,
leveraging UG’s automated sequencing bead preparation system
(AMP). Sequencing was performed on UG100 sequencing systems,
running 464 ﬂow-cycles (116 cycles across each of the four nucleo-
tides [T, G, C, A]).
Ultima genomics sequencing analysis
We aligned the reads to the human reference genome hg3823 with
STAR version 2.7.10b58. We sorted the resulting.bam ﬁles utilizing
samtools version 1.16.157. We thereafter processed these alignments
with the subread module featureCounts version 2.0.124 to verify de
novo transcript expression, and subsequently extracted normalized
counts for correlative analysis with SARTools version 1.8.125, a package
wrapping DESeq2 version 1.36.018.
