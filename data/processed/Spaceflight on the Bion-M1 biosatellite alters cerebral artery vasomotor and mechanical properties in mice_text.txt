Bion-M1 biosatellite alters cerebral artery vasomotor and mechanical
properties in mice. J Appl Physiol 118: 830–838, 2015. First pub-

Conditions during spaceﬂight, such as the loss of the head-to-foot
gravity vector, are thought to potentially alter cerebral blood ﬂow and
vascular resistance. The purpose of the present study was to determine
the effects of long-term spaceﬂight on the functional, mechanical, and
structural properties of cerebral arteries. Male C57BL/6N mice were
ﬂown 30 days in a Bion-M1 biosatellite. Basilar arteries isolated from
spaceﬂight (SF) (n  6), habitat control (HC) (n  6), and vivarium
control (VC) (n  16) mice were used for in vitro functional and
mechanical testing and histological structural analysis. The results
demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a voltage-gated
Ca2 mechanism (30–80 mM KCl) and thromboxane A2 receptors
(108  3  105 M U46619) are lower in cerebral arteries from SF
mice. Inhibition of Rho-kinase activity (1 M Y27632) abolished
group differences in U46619-evoked contractions. Endothelium-de-
pendent vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (10 M, 2 M U46619
preconstriction) was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice.
The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice
relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the
extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/
collagen ratio in the basilar arteries. Diameter, medial wall thickness,
and medial cross-sectional area of unpressurized basilar arteries were
not different among groups. These results suggest that the micrograv-
ity-induced attenuation of both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator prop-
erties may limit the range of vascular control of cerebral perfusion or
impair the distribution of brain blood ﬂow during periods of stress.
microgravity; vasoconstriction; endothelium-dependent vasodilation;
brain blood ﬂow
TRAVEL AND HABITATION in a microgravity environment repre-
sents a unique environmental stress to ﬂuid homeostasis in the
body. It has long been thought that the redistribution of ﬂuids
and ﬂuid pressures within the cardiovascular system induce
adaptations in cardiac and vascular structure and function, but
that these adaptations posed no immediate in-ﬂight health risk
to cosmonauts and astronauts. However, recently reported
changes in visual acuity among astronauts (2, 31, 36) has led to
speculation that the ﬂuid pressure redistribution in space and
increases in intracranial pressure may be related to the devel-
opment of this condition.
Spaceﬂight-induced increases in intracranial pressure could
occur through several mechanisms, including elevations in
arterial, venous, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid pressures as these
ﬂuids undergo a cephalad shift with the loss of the head-to-foot
gravity vector present on Earth. Although cerebral arterial
pressure is thought to increase 20–30 mmHg in a microgravity
environment (62), this pressure rise has been presumed to be
offset by mechanisms of cerebral autoregulation to maintain
cerebral blood ﬂow, blood volume, and ﬂuid ﬁltration into the
cranium at levels near that occurring on Earth (11, 62).
The concept that cerebral perfusion remains unaltered during
spaceﬂight has been challenged by results from the ﬁrst study
to examine isolated cerebral arteries from mice ﬂown for 2 wk
on the Space Shuttle (54). These data demonstrated that myo-
genic vasoconstrictor responses were diminished in basilar
arteries from the shuttle mice, and that these arteries were
mechanically less stiff and more distensible, resulting in larger
intraluminal diameters across a range of physiological pres-
sures. Although vasoconstrictor responses elicited through
other mechanisms were not investigated, the ﬁnding of dimin-
ished myogenic vasoconstrictor tone was contrary to the en-
hanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries
through a variety of mechanisms in head-down tail-suspended
rats (16, 18, 64, 71), a ground-based rodent model to simulate
microgravity-induced cephalad ﬂuid shifts (12, 20, 38, 45). On
the basis of these ﬁndings, the authors hypothesized that
microgravity represents a unique environmental stress whereby
the cerebral circulation is not adequately modeled with ground-
based simulations (54).
By using a 30-day mission on the Bion-M1 satellite, the
purpose of the present study was 1) to deﬁne whether longer
duration spaceﬂight diminishes vasoconstrictor responses and
alters the mechanical behavior of mouse cerebral arteries, 2) to
extend these observations to examine possible mechanisms for
putative changes in vasoconstrictor responsiveness and me-
chanical properties, and 3) to determine whether spaceﬂight
alters endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries.
We hypothesized that vasoconstrictor responses acting through
nonreceptor (voltage-gated Ca2 channels) and receptor
(thromboxane A2) mechanisms will be diminished in cerebral
arteries from spaceﬂight (SF) mice relative to that in habitat
control (HC) and vivarium control (VC) animals, and that

cerebral arteries from SF mice will demonstrate greater disten-
sibility and a corresponding increase in the elastin/collagen
ratio. And ﬁnally, on the basis of the results of Zuj et al. (74)
indicating a diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation of
cerebral arteries in astronauts, we hypothesized that endothe-
lium-dependent vasodilation will be attenuated in cerebral
arteries from SF mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All experimental procedures of the Bion-M1 project were approved
by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Russian Federation State
Research Center Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP), the Rus-
sian Academy of Sciences (protocol No. 319), and the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), and conformed to the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health (8th ed., 2011).
Animals
Pathogenic free male C57BL/6N mice were obtained from the
Animal Breeding Facility, Branch of Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov
Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Pushchino, Moscow Region, Rus-
sia. In total, four groups of mice were used: SF group (n  6), HC
group (n  6), and two VC groups (n  8 for each). All groups were
age matched, and the animals were 19–20 wk old at the time the
experiments were conducted.
The SF mice were maintained on 12-h light-dark cycle and pro-
vided a pastelike diet containing 74.6% of H2O (Table 1) 2 wk prior
to launch. One week prior to launch, the mice were shipped to the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Three days prior to launch, the
mice were placed in the cylindrical animal module habitats (diameter
98 mm, length 200 mm, approximated volume 1,700 cm3), three
animals per habitat. On 19 April 2013, the Bion-M1 biosatellite was
launched into orbit via a Soyuz 2-1a rocket from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome. The Bion-M1 capsule ﬂew a 30-day mission and landed
in the Orenburg region of Russia. Recovery personnel retrieved the
animal module habitats from the biosatellite, and initial health inspec-
tions were performed onsite in a ﬁeld laboratory. The SF mice were
then ﬂown to Moscow, Russia, and transported to the IBMP. The
animals were killed 13–15 h after landing by cervical dislocation
under the supervision of a NASA veterinarian. The brain was removed
from the cranium and placed in cold (4°C) physiological salt
solution (PSS). Basilar arteries were dissected from the brain and
placed in cold PSS until being mounted for in vitro experimentation.
The VC groups were housed in a speciﬁc pathogen-free category
vivarium, maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle and provided standard
mice chow and water ad libitum. Mice in the ﬁrst VC group were
killed 2 days following experiments with the SF mice. Methods of
euthanasia, brain dissection, and basilar artery isolation and experi-
mentation were performed identically to that of the SF group.
Following postlanding recovery of the animal module habitats from
the Bion-M1 capsule, the habitats were refurbished and readied for
housing the HC mice. Housing the HC mice in the animal module
habitats was started on 26 July 2013 and lasted for 30 days. Environ-
mental conditions [i.e., temperature, relative humidity, and partial
pressure of oxygen (pO2) and carbon dioxide (pCO2)], which were
continuously recorded during the Bion-M1 mission, and food content
and delivery were replicated on the ground for the HC group. All
experimental procedures conducted on SF animals and the ﬁrst VC
group were duplicated on HC animals and the second VC group.
The detailed description of housing conditions and environmental
parameters in ﬂight, control experiments, and the vivarium have been
described by Andreev-Andrievskiy et al. (3).
Vasomotor Experiments
Segments (1–2 mm length) from the rostral portion of the basilar
artery were cut and mounted on two 40-m stainless steel wires that
were connected to a force transducer myograph (Model 410A, DMT,
Denmark) and micrometer microdrive for recording of isometric force
under precisely controlled wall stretch. Force was recorded at 10 Hz
on a PC computer with 14–140M ADC (L-card, Russia) and Power-
graph 3.3 software (DISoft, Russia). After mounting, the segment
length was measured and the arteries were allowed to equilibrate in
PSS for 30 min while the myograph was heated to 37°C. Throughout
the experiment, PSS in the myograph vessel chambers was bubbled
with a gas mixture (95% O2-5% CO2) to maintain pH at 7.4.
Initially, the dependence of wall tension on wall internal circum-
ference for the relaxed preparation (passive length-tension relation)
was determined (see Data and Statistical Analysis) from which the
diameter, d100, was estimated from when the vessel was relaxed and
subjected to a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg. The vessels were
then set to 0.9 d100, where maximal contraction is developed (41).
The basilar arteries were then activated once with 60 mM KCl and
then constricted twice with submaximal concentration of U46619 (2
M), a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist, which demonstrated repro-
ducible vasoconstrictor response; the bathing solution was replaced
three to four times between vasoconstrictor responses and tension
returned to baseline levels. During the second contractile response to
U46619, a bolus dose of 10 M acetylcholine was added to the vessel
chamber to evaluate endothelium-dependent relaxation. These proce-
dures were followed by a 15-min equilibration period when no
vasoconstrictor or vasodilator substances were present in the bathing
medium; during this period the bathing solution was changed four
times. A dose-response to KCl was then performed by changing the
bathing solution every 3 min with solutions containing increasing
concentrations of KCl (30 to 80 mM) to determine the effects of
spaceﬂight on the cerebral artery contractile responses to smooth
muscle depolarization. Then the bathing solution was replaced four
times every 3 min, and the responsiveness of the basilar arteries to the
cumulative addition of U46619 was determined. Finally, the bathing
solution was similarly replaced four times every 3 min, and the
Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 (1 M) was then placed in the bathing
solution for 15 min; a second U46619 dose-response was then per-
formed in the presence of Y27632. Preliminary experiments showed
that 1 M Y27632 suppressed agonist-induced constriction by about

twofold (data not shown), while greater concentrations of the inhibitor
(3 M) abolish the constriction, similar to that previously reported for
murine cerebral arteries (17).
Vascular Structure and Elastin-Collagen Content
Artery segments were placed in PSS containing 104 M sodium
nitroprusside to induce smooth muscle relaxation for 15 min. The
segments were then ﬁxed in Bouin’s solution, placed in optimal
cutting temperature compound, and stored at 80°C. Five-microme-
ter-thick cryosections were cut for analysis of elastin and collagen.
Sections were stained with Verhoeff-van Gieson (Scytek Laborato-
ries, ETS-1) for elastin (Verhoeff) and collagen (van Gieson) (22).
Elastin and collagen measurements were determined via a color
threshold in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). A total pixel
measurement for each vessel was done via Image J using a set
threshold for all images. Intraluminal circumference and outer medial
circumference were measured from each vessel cross section and
modeled as concentric circles. Media wall thickness was calculated as
the difference between the outer and inner radii and media cross-
sectional area as the difference between the outer and inner area.
Solutions and Drugs
PSS contained (in mM) 120 NaCl, 26 NaHCO, 4.5 KCl, 1.6 CaCl2,
1 MgSO4, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 5.5 D-glucose, 0.025 EDTA, and 5 HEPES
with pH 7.4. Isotonic high-KCl solutions were prepared by equimolar
substitution of NaCl to KCl. Acetylcholine (A6625; Sigma) and
Y27632 (688000; Calbiochem) were dissolved in distilled water;
U46619 (16450; Cayman Chemical) stock solution was prepared in
dimethylsulphoxide.
Data and Statistical Analysis
Calculation of passive pressure-diameter response. The vessel was
stretched in stepwise manner, and at the end of each step (3 min after
the stretching) force value was recorded and then recalculated into
wall tension: T  F/2l, where T is the tension (N/m), F is force (mN),
and l is the vessel segment length (mm). Transmural pressure values
were calculated with the Laplace equation: P  T/r  T/(IC/2),
where r is the inner radius of vessel segment and P is the transmural
pressure. Vessel diameter (d) values were obtained from internal
circumference (IC), which was calculated at each step from the wires
diameter (40 m) and the distance between them (a): IC    40 
2  40  2a. Obtained values were plotted in coordinates d  f(P)
and approximated with exponential equation: P  P0  exp(k  IC),
where P0 is the value of P when wires touch, and k is the rate constant.
By using this k constant, vessel diameter values were calculated in the
range from 40 to 100 mmHg with 10-mmHg steps.
Statistical analysis. All dose-response relations are presented as
active tension (N/m) or the percent of maximal force. To estimate the
sensitivity of basilar arteries to U46619, pD2 (negative logarithm of
U46619 concentration that produced 50% of the maximal vasocon-
strictor response) was calculated in GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA).
Responses from the ﬁrst and second VC groups were compared by a
repeated measures ANOVA. Since no differences were observed, data
from the two VC groups were pooled (n  16) for subsequent data
analysis. Agonist dose-response curves between groups were analyzed
by repeated measures ANOVA (SF vs. HC and SF vs. VC). Relax-
ation to acetylcholine was calculated as the percent relaxation from
the preconstricted value elicited by 2 M U46619. The signiﬁcance of
differences in relaxation responses, body weights, muscle weights,
and segment lengths among groups (SF, HC, and VC) were analyzed
by one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test. Differ-
ences were considered signiﬁcant at P  0.05. All values are means 
SE, and n is the number of animals per group.
RESULTS
Animal and Muscle Characteristics
Preﬂight and postﬂight body masses did not differ among
groups (Table 2). Absolute and relative soleus and gastrocne-
mius muscle masses were lower postﬂight in SF mice relative
to that in HC and VC animals (Table 2), thus conﬁrming the
inﬂuence of the weightless environment during spaceﬂight.
Vessel Characteristics
The axial length of basilar artery segments used for in vitro
experimentation did not differ among the three groups (SF:
1.55  0.18 mm; HC: 1.58  0.15 mm; VC: 1.48  0.11 mm).
Based on measures from histological sections of unpressurized
basilar arteries, diameter (SF: 159  20 m; HC: 181  23
m; VC: 174  20 m), medial wall thickness (SF: 107  20
m; HC: 80  13 m; VC: 93  15 m), and medial
cross-sectional area (SF: 98,102  27,344 m2; HC: 80,922 
15,351 m2; VC: 92,539  23,056 m2) were not different
among groups.
Contractile Responses
The basilar artery contractile responses elicited by KCl from
SF mice were lower compared with that in HC and VC mice
(Fig. 1A). When contractile responses to KCl were normalized
to the response at the maximal concentration of KCl (80 mM),
there were no differences in the sensitivity of responses to KCl
between SF and control groups (Fig. 1B).
Contractile responses elicited through the thromboxane A2
receptor agonist U46619 were also lower in arteries from the
SF group compared with that in the HC and VC groups (Fig.
2A). Arterial sensitivity to U46619, however, did not change
with spaceﬂight, as indicated by the lack of difference in pD2
values between SF (6.39  0.08) and HC (6.56  0.06) or VC
(6.41  0.10) groups. In the presence of the Rho-kinase
inhibitor Y27632, the maximal contractile response to U46619
was 	50% lower in all groups. Importantly, the Rho-kinase
inhibition eliminated the between-group differences in the
responses to U46619 (Fig. 2B).
Endothelium-dependent Relaxation
To evaluate the inﬂuence of spaceﬂight on endothelium-
dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries, responses of basilar
arteries to acetylcholine were compared. Acetylcholine evoked

groups, whereas acetylcholine-mediated relaxation was virtu-
ally absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice (Fig. 3).
Vessel Mechanics
The passive pressure-diameter characteristics of the basilar
arteries appeared to be altered by spaceﬂight (Fig. 4). The inner
diameter of basilar arteries was not different between SF and
VC groups. Inner diameter was smaller in basilar arteries from
SF mice relative to that in HC mice across the range of
transmural pressures, although this did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance (P  0.076). Basilar artery elastin content did not
differ among groups (Fig. 5A), whereas the collagen content
was greater in arteries from VC mice relative to that in HC and
SF animals (Fig. 5B). The elastin/collagen ratio did not differ
among groups (Fig. 5C).
DISCUSSION
A previous study has shown that a 13-day ﬂight on the Space
Shuttle resulted in diminished myogenic vasoconstrictor re-
sponsiveness and a decrease in mechanical stiffness of
mouse cerebral arteries (54). The primary purpose of the
present study was to determine whether a 30-day mission on
the Bion-M1 biosatellite diminishes vasoconstrictor re-
sponses acting through different mechanisms. The results
demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a nonre-
ceptor, voltage-gated Ca2 mechanism (Fig. 1A) and the
thromboxane A2 receptor pathway (Fig. 2A) are diminished
in cerebral arteries from SF mice. Furthermore, inhibition of
Rho-kinase activity (Fig. 2B) indicates that this signaling
pathway is involved in the spaceﬂight-induced impairment
of vasoconstrictor responsiveness. Second, the data demon-
strate that endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired
in cerebral arteries from SF mice (Fig. 3). Finally, based on
previous results that ﬂight on the Space Shuttle reduced
cerebral artery stiffness and increased vascular distensibility
(54), we hypothesized that the cerebral arteries from the
Bion-M1 mice will demonstrate greater distensibility and a
corresponding increase in the elastin/collagen ratio. Con-
trary to our hypothesis, cerebral arteries from SF mice were
less distensible than those from HC mice (Fig. 4), and the

elastin/collagen ratio did not change with spaceﬂight (Fig.
5C). These ﬁndings suggest that mission duration or envi-
ronmental factors other than microgravity may modulate
alterations in cerebral artery mechanical properties during
spaceﬂight.
Vasoconstriction
Cerebral blood ﬂow is regulated through a variety of factors
that affect the contractile state of vascular smooth muscle cells
in cerebral arteries (1, 27, 60). One of these factors is the
inherent ability of smooth muscle cells to respond to in-
creases (contraction) and decreases (relaxation) in intravas-
cular (transmural) pressure (14, 61). It is this intrinsic
myogenic mechanism of cerebral resistance arteries that
largely maintains a constant cerebral blood ﬂow under
circumstances of changing intravascular pressure (14, 61).
Without such a mechanism, excessive cerebral blood ﬂow
and pressure through the microcirculation could rupture
small cerebral blood vessels and disrupt the blood-brain
barrier (61), such as is thought to occur when the head-to-
foot gravity vector on Earth is no longer present (11, 33).
The intrinsic tone of cerebral arteries can also be modulated
through the inﬂuence of extrinsic factors, such as locally
released or circulating vasoactive substances (1, 27, 60, 61),
which can consequently impact autoregulation of cerebral
perfusion. In particular, thromboxane A2 synthesis and its
inﬂuence on the myogenic tone of cerebral arteries has been
observed under normal physiological conditions (19, 55), as
well as in various cerebrovascular pathologies (1, 60).
The collective ﬁndings from the STS-135 shuttle and
Bion-M1 biosatellite missions demonstrate that spaceﬂight
impairs cerebral artery smooth muscle contraction through the
myogenic stretch-sensing mechanism (54), the thromboxane
A2 receptor-mediated mechanism, and the nonreceptor volt-
age-gated Ca2-channel mechanism. Both the myogenic and
U46619 mediated vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries have
been shown to function in part through the RhoA/Rho-kinase

ferences in vasoconstriction between SF and control groups
suggests that a mechanism for diminished cerebral artery
smooth muscle contraction during spaceﬂight is a reduced
Ca2 sensitivity through the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling path-
way.
It is not apparent, however, that impairment of the RhoA/
Rho-kinase mechanism of smooth muscle contraction is the
only pathway adversely affected in cerebral arteries by micro-
gravity. This notion is based on several observations. First,
KCl-induced vasoconstriction is also impaired by spaceﬂight
(Fig. 1A). KCl is primarily thought to elicit cerebral artery
smooth muscle contraction through the Ca2-calmodulin/my-
osin light chain kinase signaling mechanism without involve-
ment of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway (14, 37); the Rho-
kinase inhibitor Y27632 does not affect KCl-induced response
of murine basilar artery (17). Second, spaceﬂight has been
shown to impair the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular
Ca2-release mechanism in peripheral arteries and veins (9, 13,
51). If such impairment of the Ca2-induced Ca2 release
mechanism occurs in cerebral arteries, this could account for
the diminished KCl-mediated vasoconstriction in the SF mice.
Further research will be needed to determine whether other
mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction besides the Rho-
kinase signaling pathway are impaired in cerebral arteries with
spaceﬂight.
Vessel Wall Structure and Mechanics
Other factors could also contribute to the diminished vaso-
constriction of cerebral arteries, including the remodeling of
vessel structure and alterations in the arterial wall mechanical
properties. Neither changes in medial wall thickness nor me-
dial cross-sectional area were found to occur in the present
study, indicating changes in the gross structural properties of
cerebral arteries do not appear to underlie the contractile
deﬁcit. The pressure-diameter relation of cerebral arteries was,
however, lower in SF mice relative to that in HC animals. Such
an apparent increase in vascular stiffness could impair vaso-
constrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries. This change in
cerebral artery wall mechanics in SF mice does not appear to
be related to a decrease in elastin content, an increase in
collagen content, or a decrease in the elastin/collagen ratio.
Thus alterations in the content of extracellular matrix proteins
do not appear to account for the changes in the mechanical
properties of cerebral arteries with spaceﬂight.
Although results from the present study demonstrate a de-
crease in the pressure-diameter relation with spaceﬂight, pre-
vious work with mice ﬂown on the Space Shuttle show the
effective elastic modulus and stiffness of cerebral arteries is
reduced with spaceﬂight while vascular distensibility in the
form of the pressure-diameter relation was increased (54).
Several factors may account for these divergent results be-
tween studies, including the sex and age of the animals studied,
time in space, and environmental factors other than micrograv-
ity. Considering sex and age, although differences in these
variables existed between the groups of mice studied from the
Space Shuttle and Bion-M1 missions (shuttle: 11-wk-old fe-
male C57BL/6 mice; Bion-M1: 19- to 20-wk-old male
C57BL/6N mice), further research is needed to determine
whether animal sex or such age differences are sufﬁcient to
drive adaptation of cerebral artery mechanical properties in
opposite directions.
A second possibility is the amount of time the animals spent
in space. Animals in the present study were exposed to a
microgravity environment for more than twice as long (30
days) as the mice ﬂown on the Space Shuttle (13 days).
Evidence is available to suggest that changes in the properties
of cerebral arteries could occur in a directionally opposite
manner as the duration of spaceﬂight is extended. For example,
Arbeille et al. (4) reported that cerebral vascular resistance in
cosmonauts was lower than preﬂight levels after 15 and 18
days of ﬂight on the Mir Space Station, but returned to preﬂight
levels following 24 days of ﬂight. Likewise, Arbeille et al. (6)
reported middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity in cosmo-
nauts was higher following 2–4 days and 2–3 wk of space-
ﬂight, but lower than preﬂight levels after 5–6 mo of space-
ﬂight. These data are consistent with the notion that for some
as yet unknown reason the initial adaptation of cerebral arteries
is to increase vascular distensibility, resulting in a lower
cerebral vascular resistance and higher perfusion. However,
with longer duration ﬂight, vascular distensibility is decreased
and correspondingly cerebral perfusion is diminished.
A ﬁnal possibility for the directionally different changes in
vascular distensibility with spaceﬂight is that other environ-
mental factor(s) existed which may cause different adaptations
in the mechanical properties of cerebral arteries. For example,
the pCO2 in the Space Shuttle docked with the International
Space Station (ISS) (	2.5 mmHg) was approximately 10 times
that on Earth at sea level (0.23 mmHg) (2, 54). In contrast, the
pCO2 during the Bion-M1 mission (	0.01 mmHg) was ap-
proximately 10-fold lower than that at sea level (3). Because
CO2 is such a potent vasodilator in the cerebral circulation (26,
50, 66), chronic increases or decreases in the exposure of
cerebral arteries to this vasoactive substance could conceivably
affect its mechanical properties. Further study will be neces-
sary to determine the speciﬁc impact of chronic changes in
pCO2 on cerebral artery mechanics.
Another environmental factor that could differentially affect
cerebral artery mechanics (and function) is the level of expo-
sure to space radiation (68). The Bion-M1 biosatellite ﬂew at
an altitude of 575 km and a 64.9 degree inclination, with the
animals receiving a total radiation dose of between 32–72
mGy, depending on their cage placement in the biosatellite
(53). This resulted in a daily radiation exposure of 0.5–1.25
mGy/day (53). This level of exposure is approximately sixfold
higher than that occurring in the International Space Station,
which orbits Earth at an altitude of 	400 km, and consequently
represents the approximate dose that astronauts receive during
a 6-mo mission on the International Space Station. Thus the
total radiation dose to the Bion-M1 mice was likely much
higher than that to the mice ﬂown 13 days on the STS-135
Space Shuttle mission (54).
Regardless of the stimulus, a change in cerebral artery
mechanics during spaceﬂight could have important conse-
quences on cerebral perfusion, given that cerebral vascular
resistance is a major determinant of cerebral blood ﬂow and,
according to Poiseuille’s law, is predominantly determined by
the diameter of resistance arteries. Thus how factors during
spaceﬂight affect the pressure-diameter relation of cerebral
arteries could have a direct impact on cerebral blood ﬂow and,
consequently, intracranial pressure.

Vasodilatation
Little is known regarding the effects of spaceﬂight on the
vasodilator properties of cerebral arteries. Zuj et al. (74) have
reported that cerebral vascular reactivity to 10% inspired CO2
was diminished in astronauts following a long-duration stay on
the ISS. Cerebral vascular reactivity to acutely inspired CO2
has been suggested to reﬂect endothelium-dependent vasodila-
tion through the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway (34, 35,
48). In mice, NO is also a key mediator of cerebral artery
endothelium-dependent vasodilation (8). Thus results from the
present study of diminished endothelium-dependent vasodila-
tion of the basilar artery provide corroboration of this ﬁnding
in astronauts. It remains to be determined, however, whether
the deﬁcit in endothelium-dependent vasodilation is the result
of impaired endothelial cell signaling or diminished smooth
muscle cell relaxation to endothelium-derived relaxing fac-
tor(s). The present results are also consistent with studies of
cerebral arteries isolated from head-down tail-suspended rats, a
ground-based animal model to simulate microgravity, which
have shown diminished endothelial NO synthase (NOS) pro-
tein expression (64) and impaired endothelium-dependent va-
sodilation through the NOS mechanism (44, 72, 73).
Implications for Cerebral Blood Flow Regulation
On the basis of results from the present study of diminished
KCl and U46619-evoked cerebral artery vasoconstriction, as
well as the previously reported reduction in myogenic vaso-
constriction (54), one could surmise that cerebral perfusion is
elevated during spaceﬂight. Indeed, ﬂow-induced constriction,
which is mediated through thromboxane A2 receptors in cere-
bral arteries (55), and myogenic vasoconstriction are important
determinants of cerebral autoregulation (29, 42, 55, 61). The
notion of higher cerebral blood ﬂow during spaceﬂight is
further supported by results from a chronically instrumented
rhesus monkey ﬂown 5 days on the Cosmos 1514 biosatellite,
where carotid ﬂow velocity was elevated because of a signif-
icant reduction in vascular resistance (46). An additional line
of evidence regarding the potential impact of cephalad ﬂuid
shifts on cerebral hemodynamics comes from the remodeling
of the skull that occurs with spaceﬂight. In mice, rats, and
humans, skull bone volume (70) and mineral density (21, 32,
39) are increased with short duration ﬂight on the Space
Shuttle. In this nonload-bearing bone, skeletal remodeling to
increase bone density could be in response to increases in
cerebral perfusion and consequent elevations in intracranial
pressure (28, 57, 70).
Despite the evidence to infer elevations in brain blood ﬂow
during spaceﬂight, decrements in cerebral artery endothelium-
dependent vasodilation and reductions in vascular distensibil-
ity suggest that the effects of spaceﬂight on cerebral blood ﬂow
may not be so clear, as also reﬂected by studies reporting
increases (4, 6, 24, 25, 40, 43, 56, 59, 69), no change (5, 7, 74),
or decreases (10, 74) in cerebral perfusion in astronauts and
cosmonauts. What does seem apparent is that the range of the
cerebral circulation to precisely regulate brain blood ﬂow
through vasoconstriction and vasodilation is impaired by
spaceﬂight. Such changes in vascular control mechanisms may
not only be reﬂected through changes in the magnitude of
cerebral blood ﬂow, but may adversely impact the redistribu-
tion of cerebral blood during periods of stress, such as mental
(63, 67), exercise (15, 23), and othostatic (47, 64) stress.
In considering whether spaceﬂight affects regional distribu-
tion of cerebral blood ﬂow, one question that arises is whether
the effects of microgravity on basilar artery structure and
function are limited to this speciﬁc cerebral artery or are
indicative of changes occurring more globally in the cerebral
circulation. Two lines of evidence suggest that the results
found in the basilar artery are representative of a larger effect
on cerebral arteries. First, in the only other study describing the
effects of spaceﬂight on cerebral arteries, Taylor et al. (54)
reported greater distensibility (passive pressure-diameter rela-
tion) in basilar arteries and reduced stiffness (load-displace-
ment curve) in posterior communicating arteries from the same
animals. These corresponding measures of the mechanical
properties of cerebral arteries indicate a broad effect of micro-
gravity on the cerebral circulation. Second, there are numerous
studies demonstrating in head-down tail-suspended rats that
changes in vascular structure (52, 64, 65), vasoconstrictor
responsiveness (18, 52, 64, 71), and endothelium-dependent
vasodilator responsiveness (44, 72, 73) similarly occur in
basilar arteries and middle cerebral arteries. These studies
collectively suggest that the effects of spaceﬂight on basilar
artery structure and function may not be limited to only the
vertebrobasilar regions of the brain.
In summary, results from the present study demonstrate for
the ﬁrst time that spaceﬂight diminishes KCl (Fig. 1A) and
U46619-evoked (Fig. 2A) cerebral artery vasoconstriction. The
reduction in the thromboxane A2 receptor-mediated vasocon-
striction appears to occur through a reduced Ca2 sensitivity
mechanism via impairment in the Rho-kinase signaling path-
way (Fig. 2B), whereas the reduced KCl-induced constriction
likely occurs through some other as yet unknown mechanism.
The results also demonstrate that endothelium-dependent va-
sodilation is attenuated by spaceﬂight (Fig. 3). Finally, in
contrast to a previous report (54), the current results demon-
strate that cerebral artery distensibility is attenuated by space-
ﬂight (Fig. 4), although this change in the mechanical proper-
ties of the cerebral artery does not appear to be related to the
extracellular matrix protein content of the arterial wall (Fig. 5).
Collectively, these data suggest that spaceﬂight impairs the
ability of the cerebral circulation to precisely control brain
blood ﬂow. Further, we speculate that environmental condi-
tions other than microgravity in the spacecraft may affect
structural and functional adaptations of the cerebral arteries.
For example, CO2, which is a potent cerebral vasodilator (26,
50, 66) and is known to interact with cerebral autoregulation to
elevate intracranial pressure (30, 49, 58), as well as space
radiation (68), could account for some of the variability ob-
served with spaceﬂight-induced alterations in cerebral artery
mechanics and astronaut and cosmonaut brain blood ﬂow.
Additional research will be required to determine the speciﬁc
impact of these environmental factors, and whether they con-
tribute to putative elevations in intracranial pressure among
astronauts and cosmonauts (2, 31, 36).
