ABSTRACT
Past results have suggested that bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is al-
tered during space ﬂight. To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in
matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space ﬂight mi-
crogravity on the International Space Station, termed ﬂight (FL) samples, or at Earth-
normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The susceptibility of FL and GC
samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using
the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. Only 9 compounds were identiﬁed
by PM screening as exhibiting signiﬁcant differences (P  0.05, Student’s t test) in FL
versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomeﬂoxacin, man-
ganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and triﬂuopera-
zine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not re-
veal statistically signiﬁcant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s)
between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the susceptibility of B. subtilis
cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors is not dramatically altered
by space ﬂight.
IMPORTANCE This study addresses a major concern of mission planners for human
space ﬂight, that bacteria accompanying astronauts on long-duration missions might
develop a higher level of resistance to antibiotics due to exposure to the space
ﬂight environment. The results of this study do not support that notion.

n physical terms, the space ﬂight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation, etc.),
causes a number of changes in a microbial cell’s immediate surroundings, such as the
loss of convective mass and heat transfer and a reduction in mechanical shear force.
Alterations in such fundamental physical parameters affect the rates at which gases,
nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between the mi-
crobe and its surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress
(the so-called “space ﬂight syndrome”) and mount a complex set of stress responses (1).
There is considerable interest in studying the responses of microorganisms to the
human space ﬂight environment, driven in part by reports that: (i) astronaut immune
function becomes dysregulated during long-term space ﬂight (2–4); (ii) certain patho-
genic and opportunistic bacteria appear to exhibit enhanced virulence in space ﬂight
(3, 5); and (iii) space ﬂight can alter the antibiotic resistance of some microorganisms
(6–8). However, the results of experiments to evaluate the effect of space ﬂight on any
particular phenotype appear to differ depending on the microorganism tested and the
experimental setup. It is thus becoming evident that the physiological responses of

microbes to the space ﬂight environment differ, and that it is unlikely that one single
model is sufﬁcient to explain them.
Antibiotic resistance in space. One often-quoted consequence of the space ﬂight
stress response of microbes is an increased resistance to antibiotics (reviewed in
reference 9). Early studies of microbial antibiotic resistance in microgravity focused
mainly on transient physiologic changes leading to increased or decreased antibiotic
susceptibility (6, 7, 9, 10). An increase in microbial antibiotic resistance in the micro-
gravity environment was concluded from experiments performed on Salyut 7 (10) and
the space shuttles Challenger (6) and Discovery (7). In these experiments, the increased
antibiotic resistance observed in space was apparently a physiologic, not a heritable
genetic, response that was reversible upon return of the microbial cultures to normal
gravity (11). However, a recent careful review of the literature regarding antibiotic
resistance in space led Taylor to conclude that “the anomalies generated by this
confusing body of work can only be completely resolved by further in-ﬂight experi-
mentation undertaken in systematic fashion” (3).
In contrast, space ﬂight has been documented to cause genetic alterations (i.e.,
mutations) leading to antibiotic resistance. In experiments performed on space station
Mir and the International Space Station (ISS), it was observed that both the frequency
and the spectrum of mutations conferring resistance to the antibiotics streptomycin in
Escherichia coli (12) and rifampin in Staphylococcus epidermidis (13) were clearly altered.
Experiments on the ISS have demonstrated that horizontal transfer of antibiotic
resistance plasmids can occur among both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bac-
teria (14). Furthermore, an exchange of microﬂora has been reported among cosmo-
nauts in ground-based conﬁnement scenarios, among Apollo astronauts, and among
Shuttle and ISS crews (reviewed in reference 9). Taken together, these observations may
lead to a scenario in which opportunistic pathogens could gain antibiotic resistance,
establish residence inside the habitat or in astronauts, and disseminate through the
astronaut population.
To test the notion that antibiotic resistance becomes enhanced during space ﬂight,
we chose to measure the resistance of space- versus Earth-grown bacterial cells to a
large battery of antibiotics belonging to several classes with differing modes of action.
For this study, we chose to use the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which
possesses several advantages as a model organism: (i) it is susceptible to a wide range
of antibiotics, (ii) it is easily cultivated and amenable to genetic manipulation, (iii) it
forms dormant spores, making it an easy system to prepare for space ﬂight, (iv) it is the
best-studied Gram-positive bacterium, and (v) the development of its genetics, genom-
ics, and molecular biology is highly advanced. The advantage of using the well-
developed B. subtilis system is that any potential effect of space ﬂight can readily be
investigated in further detail. We therefore describe here the phenotypic proﬁling of B.
subtilis in response to 72 different antibiotics and growth inhibitors after growth on the
ISS compared to that of matched ground controls.
RESULTS
PM screening for differential antibiotic resistance in FL versus GC samples.
Using Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) plates PM-11C, PM-12B, and PM-13B (Table
1), triplicate B. subtilis ﬂight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples were screened for
their resistance to 72 antibiotics and growth inhibitors. Each compound was tested at
four different concentrations, and FL samples were compared to GC samples. For the
majority of compounds tested (63 of 72), no signiﬁcant difference was detected in FL
versus GC samples by PM screening, and statistically signiﬁcant differences were
detected for 9 of the 72 compounds tested (Table 1). These nine inhibitors were divided
into two groups. The ﬁrst group consisted of FL samples which showed signiﬁcantly
increased resistance compared to GC samples, and the second group consisted of FL
samples which showed signiﬁcantly decreased resistance compared to GC samples.

Compounds with higher resistance in FL samples. In PM assays, FL samples
displayed signiﬁcantly greater resistance toward 3 of the growth inhibitors tested:
enoxacin, 6-mercaptopurine, and triﬂuoperazine (Table 2; Fig. 1).
Enoxacin. Enoxacin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic belonging to the
ﬂuoroquinolone family that is no longer used clinically in the United States. It acts
primarily by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (15). The resistance to
enoxacin was observed to be 50-fold higher in FL (area under the curve [AUC] of
2,508  627) than in GC (AUC of 44  58) samples (Table 2). Examination of the dose
response of FL versus GC samples to enoxacin showed that FL cultures were signiﬁ-
cantly more resistant than GC cultures at the highest enoxacin concentration tested, in
well E08 (Fig. 1A).
6-Mercaptopurine. The DNA synthesis inhibitor 6-mercaptopurine is primarily used
as an anticancer and immunosuppressive drug and is not currently used clinically to
treat bacterial infections. However, recent studies have indicated that it can inhibit the
growth of Mycobacterium spp. (16, 17). The resistance to 6-mercaptopurine was ob-
served to be 2-fold higher in FL (AUC of 3,722  894) than in GC (AUC of 1,835  11)
samples (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to
6-mercaptopurine revealed that FL cultures were signiﬁcantly more resistant than GC
cultures in the second well tested, C02 (Fig. 1B).
Triﬂuoperazine. Triﬂuoperazine is an efﬂux pump inhibitor originally identiﬁed as an
antipsychotic and anxiolytic drug but has since been shown to exhibit broad-spectrum in
vitro antimicrobial activity (18, 19). The resistance to triﬂuoperazine was observed to be
1.8-fold higher in FL (AUC of 3,659  749) than in GC (AUC of 2,018  628) samples (Table
2). Examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to triﬂuoperazine showed

that FL cultures were signiﬁcantly more resistant than GC cultures at the second concen-

Compounds with higher resistance in GC samples. GC samples were observed to
be signiﬁcantly more resistant than FL samples to 6 growth inhibitors [lomeﬂoxacin,
nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, manganese(II) chloride, and cesium
chloride] (Table 2; Fig. 2).
Lomeﬂoxacin and nalidixic acid. Lomeﬂoxacin and nalidixic acid are both ﬂuoro-
quinolone antibiotics belonging to the same family as enoxacin (20) and which also inhibit

DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (21, 22). The resistance to lomeﬂoxacin was observed to
be 1.4-fold lower in FL (AUC of 3,222  776) than in GC (AUC of 4,509  135) samples,
and the resistance to nalidixic acid was also observed to be 1.4-fold lower in FL (AUC of
2,496  200) than in GC (AUC of 3,437  105) samples (Table 2). An examination of the
dose response of FL versus GC samples to lomeﬂoxacin showed that FL cultures were
signiﬁcantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the highest concentration of lomeﬂoxa-
cin tested, in well B12 (Fig. 2A) and at the third concentration of nalidixic acid tested,
in well E11 (Fig. 2B). Note that at the highest concentration of nalidixic acid tested (well
E12), FL samples appeared to be more resistant than GC samples. However, we were
unable to compare FL versus GC samples statistically, because no metabolic activity was
detected in the GC samples (Fig. 2B).
Penimepicycline. Penimepicycline is a combination of mepicycline, a derivative of
tetracycline which inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit
(23), and phenoxymethylpenicillin, a derivative of the cell wall inhibitor penicillin (24);
this antibiotic is no longer commercially available. The resistance to penimepicycline
was observed to be slightly (1.2-fold) but signiﬁcantly lower in FL (AUC of 3,738 
269) than in GC (AUC of 4,400  160) samples (Table 2). An examination of the dose
response of FL versus GC samples to penimepicycline showed that FL cultures were
signiﬁcantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the second concentration tested, in well
B06 (Fig. 2C).
Rolitetracycline. Rolitetracycline is also a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline
(23). The resistance to rolitetracycline was observed to be slightly (1.1-fold) but
signiﬁcantly lower in FL (AUC of 4,556  53) than in GC (AUC of 4,998  167) samples
(Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to rolitetra-
cycline showed that FL cultures were signiﬁcantly more sensitive than GC cultures at
the ﬁrst concentration tested, in well D09 (Fig. 2D).
Cesium chloride. Cesium chloride (CsCl) is known to be toxic to many microorgan-
isms, but its cellular target(s) and mechanism(s) of action are poorly understood (25).
The resistance to CsCl was observed to be signiﬁcantly lower (1.13-fold and 1.27-
fold) in FL than in GC samples at the two highest concentrations tested, exhibiting
AUCs of 3,219  68 and 2,467  91 (FL) versus AUCs of 3,462  112 and 3,139  100
(GC), respectively (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC
samples to CsCl showed that FL cultures were signiﬁcantly more sensitive than GC
cultures at the third and fourth concentrations tested, in wells F03 and F04 (Fig. 2E).
Mn(II)Cl2. Growth inhibition by manganese results from its competitive replace-
ment of a magnesium cofactor in essential enzymes (26). Resistance to Mn(II)Cl2 was
observed to be slightly lower (1.06-fold) in FL (AUC of 5,391  120) than in GC (AUC
of 5,713  133) samples (Table 2). An examination of the dose response of FL versus
GC samples to Mn(II)Cl2 revealed that FL cultures were signiﬁcantly more sensitive than
GC cultures in the third well tested, G07 (Fig. 2F).
Additional DNA gyrase inhibitors. We noted above that of the 9 compounds
exhibiting differing resistance levels by PM screening in FL versus GC samples, three
(enoxacin, lomeﬂoxacin, and nalidixic acid) belonged to the quinolone/ﬂuoroquinolone
family of DNA gyrase inhibitors, suggesting that DNA supercoiling may be affected by
space ﬂight. The gyrase inhibitors oﬂoxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin were also
included in our initial Omnilog PM screening, but were not identiﬁed as exhibiting
signiﬁcant differences in FL versus GC samples (Table 1). When the PM data were
examined more closely (Fig. 3), we observed that oﬂoxacin, oxolinic acid, and novo-
biocin were not present in PM plates at concentration ranges useful for determining
resistance or sensitivity to these antibiotics. In the cases of oﬂoxacin and oxolinic acid,
both FL and GC samples grew equally well at all four concentrations tested (Fig. 3A and
B). On the other hand, the growth of FL and GC samples was essentially inhibited
completely at all 4 concentrations of novobiocin tested (Fig. 3C). Thus, no conclusions
about the relative resistance of FL versus GC samples to these three antibiotics could
be drawn from the PM screening experiment. Consequently, we chose to test the

resistance of FL versus GC samples to oﬂoxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin using the
broth dilution method as described in the following section.
IC50s of FL versus GC samples by broth dilution. While PM microplates were very
convenient and useful for high-throughput screening of the resistance proﬁles of FL
and GC samples to many antibiotics, they also presented a number of limitations. First,
the actual concentrations of the antibiotics present in the PM screening plates are
proprietary information. Second, in some instances, the antibiotic concentrations in PM
plates were not within a useful range (Fig. 3). Third, not all representatives of each
antibiotic class are included on PM plates. For these reasons, we chose to more closely
quantify antibiotic resistance levels (50% inhibitory concentrations [IC50s]) of FL and GC
samples to a selection of antibiotics using the broth dilution method as described in
Materials and Methods. We determined the IC50s of FL and GC samples to antibiotics
identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly different in PM plates (6-mercaptopurine, enoxacin, lome-
ﬂoxacin, nalidixic acid, and triﬂuoperazine). We also tested quinolone/ﬂuoroquinolone
antibiotics that were included in PM plates but were outside a useful concentration
range (oﬂoxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin). In addition, due to their common
clinical use and their inclusion in the ISS pharmacy (27), we also decided to determine
the IC50s for the ﬂuoroquinolone antibiotics ciproﬂoxacin and levoﬂoxacin, which were
not included in the PM panels used. Each of the 10 antibiotics were screened over a
range of concentrations allowing normal growth to complete sensitivity, and IC50s were
determined for each sample using normalized A, , and AUC. The broth dilution data
are presented graphically for ciproﬂoxacin as an example of how the IC50s were
determined for each antibiotic (Fig. 4), and the complete data set of IC50s for all 10
antibiotics is presented in Table 3. Examination of the data revealed no statistically
signiﬁcant differences between the IC50s for FL versus GC samples regardless of the
parameter used (A, , or AUC) for any of the 10 antibiotics tested (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Understanding the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human
space ﬂight environment is relevant to long-term human missions to distant explora-
tion targets such as asteroids or Mars (11). In particular, the possibility that space ﬂight
increases the resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics and other biocidal com-
pounds has long been of concern to mission planners. In the experiments reported
here we measured the antibiotic resistance proﬁles of B. subtilis cells, grown in the
space ﬂight environment onboard the International Space Station and in matched
ground control conditions, to a battery of 72 antibiotics and growth inhibitors using
Omnilog PM microplates. In PM microplates, no signiﬁcant difference in the resistance
levels between FL versus GC samples was observed for 63 out of the 72 compounds

tested (Table 1). Only 9 of 72 antibiotics tested in PM plates demonstrated statistically
signiﬁcant differences in the resistance levels of FL versus GC samples (Table 2).
However, the magnitude of differences in FL versus GC resistance to 8 of the 9
antibiotics, while statistically signiﬁcant, was very modest (2-fold or less) (Table 2).
Furthermore, FL samples were more resistant than GC samples to only 3 of the 9
antibiotics, but were more sensitive than GC samples to 6 of the 9 antibiotics tested
(Table 2). In PM microarrays, FL samples were dramatically more resistant than GC
samples to only one of the 72 antibiotics tested, enoxacin (50-fold; Table 2). This
result will be discussed further below. Taken together, the PM data do not support the
generally held contention that growth of microbes under space ﬂight conditions leads
to increased antibiotic resistance.
We next used standard broth dilution assays to determine the IC50s for 10 clinically
relevant antibiotics that warranted closer examination. No statistically signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in IC50s were observed between the FL and GC samples for any of the
antibiotics tested, regardless of the growth parameter examined (maximum growth
achieved [A], maximum growth rate [], or AUC) (Table 3). For most of the antibiotics
tested, these results were not surprising, given the very slight (2-fold or less) effects
seen in the PM microplate assays (Table 2). In the case of only one antibiotic, enoxacin,
were the PM and broth dilution results clearly at odds. This discrepancy may be due to
the different variables tested in the two assays. In PM microplates, metabolic activity is

measured photometrically using a redox dye, whereas in the broth dilution assay, cell
growth is measured by turbidity, i.e., by optical density. Regardless, the results of the
two assays do not support the notion that space ﬂight increases the antibiotic resis-
tance of microorganisms.
We feel obliged to discuss alternative factors that might affect the above conclusion.
First, the choice of growth media, culture conditions, test organisms, and space ﬂight
hardware can account for differing responses to the space ﬂight environment (re-
viewed in reference 3). Second, the experimental design we used might deemphasize
differences between FL and GC samples. Despite the different environments in which
FL and GC samples were grown, the actual antibiotic resistance assays were performed
under Earth-bound laboratory conditions. It is possible that during the 24-hour dura-
tion of the assays, FL samples might have readapted physiologically to 1 g, thus
minimizing differences with the GC samples. While it is difﬁcult to control for this factor,
we note a previous space ﬂight experiment in which Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium cells were grown in FL and GC, and FL samples were shown to be more
virulent in BALB/c mice on Earth after space ﬂight (28).
The results presented here indicate that space ﬂight causes only minimal alterations
in the phenotypic response of B. subtilis cells to antibiotic susceptibility, with the
possible exception of enoxacin. The probability that any differences seen could have
resulted from a genetic change, such as a mutation, is very low. In a separate
experiment using the same biological research in canisters (BRIC)-21 FL and GC samples
as those tested here, we measured the frequencies of mutations to antibiotic resistance
in all of the FL and GC petri dish ﬁxation units (PDFUs) used in this study (data to be
published elsewhere). In all 12 samples, the mutation frequencies were less than 107
(i.e., less than 1 mutant per 10 million cells). This frequency is much too low to produce
an effect on the antibiotic resistance of the bulk population.
To gain a more accurate understanding of the response of microbial cells to
antibiotics in space, it would be ideal to design experiments for the high-throughput
screening of antibiotics directly in the space ﬂight environment. A preliminary step has
already been taken in this direction. For example, the resistance of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae yeast to the antifungal agent voriconazole was shown to differ in FL versus
GC samples using the free-ﬂying PharmaSat nanosatellite (8); such a design could
readily be adapted for high-throughput in-ﬂight antibiotic screening either by a
free-ﬂying nanosatellite or by a small semiautonomous payload sent to the ISS.
Taken at face value, it would seem that the results of this study imply that there is
little cause for alarm regarding the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes during
human space ﬂight. However, it should be emphasized that these in vitro experiments
exploring antibiotic resistance only touch upon one small facet of the chemotherapy of
a potentially infected astronaut. Many aspects of the interplay among the host, the
microbe, and the antibiotic (such as modes of entry, routes of pathogenesis, pharma-
cokinetics, etc.), which have been studied extensively in Earth-bound clinical settings,
have yet to be explored in the space ﬂight environment.
As a ﬁnal note, aside from their clinical signiﬁcance, antibiotics have long been used
to probe basic biological processes at the molecular level (such as replication, tran-
scription, translation, membrane and cell wall biogenesis, etc.). From this perspective,
it is interesting to note that among the 9 antibiotics ﬂagged by PM screening as
showing different sensitivities in FL versus GC samples, 3 belonged to the quinolone/
ﬂuoroquinolone class of compounds (lomeﬂoxacin, enoxacin, and nalidixic acid). These
compounds inhibit DNA gyrases, which are type II DNA topoisomerases that function
to (i) condense DNA in the cell, (ii) maintain DNA under the optimal supercoiled state
for gene expression, and (iii) decatenate DNA during chromosome partitioning (29);
all three functions of DNA gyrases are essential for cell viability, and moreover, are
sensitive to environmental changes. From the above observations, it is attractive to
speculate that the growth of cells in the space ﬂight environment may lead to
alterations in DNA supercoiling, hence, in global gene expression (30). This notion

could be tested directly by measuring the superhelicity of DNA in FL versus GC cells
of B. subtilis in a manner similar to that previously described (31).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strain, medium, and growth conditions. The bacterium used was B. subtilis strain 168
from our laboratory stock collection. The medium used throughout for routine cultivation and plating
was Trypticase soy-yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/liter): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5;
yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; ﬁnal pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added at 15.0 g/liter.
For the cultivation of space ﬂight and ground control cells in space ﬂight hardware, TSY medium
containing 10% (vol/vol) glycerol was prepared by mixing equal volumes of sterile double-strength TSY
and sterile 20% (vol/vol) glycerol. This medium was used because it supports cell growth to a high
density and was used in a prior space ﬂight experiment (13). Spores of strain 168 were prepared and
puriﬁed as described previously (32) and were stored at 4°C in deionized water. An examination by
phase-contrast microscopy conﬁrmed that the spore preparation was devoid of vegetative cells and con-
tained 99% phase-bright spores. The spore suspension was heat activated (65°C for 20 min) before use.
From a working suspension (108/ml) of spores in water, aliquots of 0.1 ml (107 CFU) were applied to the
bottoms of sterile 60-mm-diameter petri dishes (Falcon catalog no. 1007; Fisher Scientiﬁc) and air dried for 48
to 72 h at room temperature protected from light prior to placement in space ﬂight hardware.
BRIC space ﬂight hardware. Samples were integrated into biological research in canisters-dual
chamber (BRIC-DC) space ﬂight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (33–35). BRIC
canisters hold six 60-mm-diameter petri dish bottoms in small subcompartments called petri dish ﬁxation
units (PDFUs). Each PDFU allows for the injection of medium, referred to as actuation, to initiate bacterial
growth. For ﬂight (FL) experiments, 2 BRIC canisters were used, each containing ﬁve PDFUs and one
HOBO temperature data logger (Onset, Inc., Cape Cod MA). Postﬂight asynchronous ground control (GC)
experiments were conducted using the same hardware and conﬁguration as in the FL experiment. Each
PDFU was loaded with a petri dish containing air-dried spores, and 17 ml of sterile TSY plus 10% glycerol
medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment
used were sterilized in an autoclave prior to use, and PDFUs were assembled using an aseptic technique
within a biosafety level 2 (BSL2)-rated biological safety cabinet.
Experimental ﬂight timeline. The BRIC-PDFU payload described above was the 21st BRIC mission
to space, and was designated BRIC-21. The payload was launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on
the 6th SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the ISS (SpaceX-6 CRS) on 14 April 2015, using the Falcon 9
rocket and Dragon capsule conﬁguration. The growth of ﬂight (FL) samples was initiated by the injection
of 8.5 ml TSY plus 10% glycerol medium on 20 April 2015 (Fig. 5A), and they were incubated at ambient
ISS temperature for 25 h (Fig. 5B). Temperature data were logged at 10-min intervals during the FL
experiment. The average temperature recorded during the growth periods in the FL canister was 22.8 
0.07°C. Preﬂight experimentation indicated that under these conditions of medium, temperature, and
time, cells grew to the late exponential phase (data not shown). At the end of the incubation period, BRIC
canisters were transferred into 80°C freezers, and the HOBO units registered temperatures below 0°C
within 60 min (FL) and 80 min (GC) (Fig. 5B). All HOBO units performed nominally for the entire duration
of the experiment. On 21 April 2015, growth was terminated by the transfer of the BRIC canisters to the
onboard minus eighty-degree laboratory freezer for ISS (MELFI). FL samples were kept frozen for their
return to Earth in the Dragon capsule on 21 May 2015 and were maintained in the frozen state until their
return to KSC on 1 June 2015 for deintegration. Samples were recovered from BRIC canisters in the frozen
state, transported on dry ice to the laboratory, and stored at 80°C.
Postﬂight asynchronous ground control (GC) experiment samples were prepared and treated using
the same BRIC-PDFU hardware, conﬁguration, schedule, and temperature proﬁle as in the FL experiment.

BRIC-PDFU hardware was incubated in the ISS environmental simulation (ISSES) chamber at KSC, which
was programmed to play back the ISS temperature proﬁle recorded by the HOBO data loggers during
the ﬂight (Fig. 5B). The average temperature recorded in the GC experiment was 22.8  0.21°C. After 25
h of incubation, the samples were transferred to a 80°C freezer.
Antibiotic resistance proﬁling using phenotype microarray. The determination of antibiotic
resistance patterns among FL and GC samples was performed using the Omnilog phenotype microarray
(PM) system (Biolog, Inc., Hayward, CA) using the manufacturer’s recommend plates, reagents, and
protocols. Frozen FL and GC cultures were partially thawed at room temperature, and then the partially
frozen cell slurries were transferred into sterile 15-ml conical centrifuge tubes and placed immediately on
ice to complete the thawing. The culture volumes recovered were recorded for later calculations. Each
culture was mixed thoroughly by vortexing, and an aliquot was removed for viable cell count determi-
nation. Cells were recovered by centrifugation (7,000  g for 20 min at 0°C) in a benchtop centrifuge, and
cell pellets were immediately suspended by vortex mixing in 5 ml of inoculating ﬂuid (IF) IF-10b (Biolog,
Hayward, CA). Cells were then diluted with fresh IF-10b until the suspension reached an optical density
at 660 nm (OD660) of 0.08 in a UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu model UV 1800). From
a prior calibration curve, we determined that this OD660 in a standard 1-cm-path-length cuvette
corresponded to 81% transmittance in Biolog’s turbidimeter (data not shown).
Omnilog PM plates PM-11C, PM-12B, and PM-13B are 96-well microtiter plates, with each plate
containing 4 different concentrations of 24 different antibiotics or growth-inhibiting compounds. (Note
that the concentration of each compound in each well is information proprietary to Biolog, Inc.) A
complete list of the 72 compounds in these plates is available at http://www.biolog.com/pdf/pm_lit/
PM11-PM20.pdf. An inoculation mixture was prepared consisting of (per plate): 10 ml of IF-10b, 1 ml of
PM additive (12), 0.12 ml of dye mix H, and 0.88 ml of cell suspension. Each well was inoculated with
100 l of the inoculation mixture and incubated at 37°C for 24 h in the Omnilog PM instrument (Biolog).
Cell metabolism was monitored by the change in color of a redox dye. In the instrument, absorbance
readings from all wells were automatically recorded at 15-min intervals and assigned arbitrary values
(“Omnilog units”) from 0 to 350. All assays were performed using triplicate FL and GC samples. Antibiotics
and growth inhibitors that displayed signiﬁcant differences between FL and GC samples in the PM
system were chosen for closer examination by the broth dilution assay, described below.
Antibiotic resistance levels using broth dilution assays. The quantiﬁcation of antibiotic resistance
was determined by the broth dilution assay (36). Brieﬂy, frozen FL or GC samples were thawed on ice as
described above and immediately inoculated into liquid TSY plus 10% glycerol medium containing
various concentrations of each test antibiotic in a 96-well microtiter plate format. To prevent evaporation,
plates were sealed with gas-permeable membranes (Breathe-Easy membrane; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO). Plates were placed in a microplate absorbance spectrophotometer (model ELx808; BioTek Instru-
ments, Inc., Winooski, VT) set at 37°C. Optical density at 620 nm (OD620) was recorded at 15-min intervals
for 24 h. All assays were performed using triplicate FL and GC samples.
Data set properties and analyses. The complete PM data set consisted of 2 conditions (FL versus
GC)  3 replicates  3 PM plates  96 wells per plate  96 kinetic time points per well, resulting in a
total of 165,888 data points in 1,728 kinetic curves. Data were exported into Microsoft Excel and the
statistical environment R (37) for further analysis. R packages were obtained from the comprehensive R
archive network (CRAN) at https://cran.r-project.org/. Using the R package groﬁt (38), four growth models
(logical, gompertz, gompertz.exp, and Richards) were ﬁt to the data points of each curve. From the
model, the software could calculate four statistical parameters for quantifying properties within each
curve: length of the lag phase (), maximum growth rate (), maximum growth achieved (A), and area
under the curve (AUC). Because the AUC is dependent upon the other three parameters, and thus is more
broadly discriminatory, we chose the comparison of AUC values for the initial screening between FL and
GC samples by PM.
The complete broth dilution data set consisted of 2 conditions (FL versus GC)  3 replicates  10
antibiotics  97 time points per curve, for a total of 5,820 data points within 420 curves. Best-ﬁt curves
were generated by spline interpolation using the R groﬁt software gcFitSpline, and the 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC50) was computed for each sample over a range of antibiotic concentrations. IC50s were
determined using A, , and AUC for every well. The parameters A and  were included to separately
analyze the dose response of the maximum growth rate and maximum OD of FL and GC samples. The
three parameters were normalized by subtracting the corresponding parameter from the blank well and
dividing by that from the control (i.e., no antibiotic) well. The normalized values were transferred into
GraphPad Prism version 7.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). GraphPad then calculated
the IC50 for each antibiotic by ﬁtting to each sample a log(inhibitor) versus response nonlinear regression
model with variable slope.
All statistical analyses comparing FL and GC samples were performed using Student’s t tests
contained in the R statistical package stats (37). Differences with P values  0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
