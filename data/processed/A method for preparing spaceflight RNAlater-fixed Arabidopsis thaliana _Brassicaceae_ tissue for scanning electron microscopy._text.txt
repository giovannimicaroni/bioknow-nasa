 Experimental ﬂ exibility is a luxury often taken for granted 
in typical laboratory science. Adapting a protocol in response 
to unfolding information as the experiment proceeds is a key 
element in discovery and is standard practice. In spaceﬂ ight, 
this luxury is not as accessible; crew time is highly regulated, 
orbital resources are limited, and protocols are tightly controlled 
once in place. In addition, the up-mass available to each re-
searcher is limited, which restricts the choices of experimental 
treatments and orbital ﬁ xation options. These constraints often 
translate into hard choices that limit the scientiﬁ c return on 
investment, including sacriﬁ cing the number of replicates to 
enable additional treatment and ﬁ xation scenarios. As a conse-
quence, options that allow maximization of the data obtained 
from a single sample are highly valued. 
 Biological experiments are typically required to be segre-
gated based on the analyses to be performed upon return from 
spaceﬂ ight. These segregated conditions are usually either mo-
lecular or morphological, due to the separate ﬁ xatives required 
for each application (e.g.,  Stutte et al., 2006 ). Investigations 
focused on transcriptome analyses, for instance, would not be 
likely to commit a portion of their limited up-mass on samples 
and associated ﬁ xation hardware for morphological applications, 
and would miss the opportunity to use both morphological 
and molecular perspectives. These limitations are keenly felt in 
scenarios where the transcriptome analyses reveal spaceﬂ ight-
speciﬁ c patterns of gene expression central to morphological 
patterns of cell growth and development. This scenario was en-
countered in a recent spaceﬂ ight experiment, in which telemet-
ric imaging revealed interesting spaceﬂ ight-associated root 
morphologies ( Paul et al., 2012 ). All material was ﬁ xed on orbit 
in RNA later (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA) to facili-
tate transcriptome analyses on returned samples. 
 Although it is possible to partition an experiment into mo-
lecular and morphological components, using samples that cor-
respond directly to those used in molecular applications would 
be of extreme value. A single ﬁ xation protocol better enables 
the full use of replicates to support a robust power analysis; 
all plant material allowed by the up-mass constraints can be 
dedicated to a single application per orbital treatment. Addi-
tionally, the plant material apportioned for microscopy can be 
taken directly from the pool of material whose balance repre-
sents a molecular replicate; thus, any morphologic change seen 
in these plants would directly reﬂ ect the effects of the altered 
gene expressions from those same plants. Terrestrial ﬁ eld stud-
ies could also beneﬁ t from this single ﬁ xative approach for 
similar reasons. 
 Despite its use as a molecular ﬁ xative, RNA later is not com-
monly used as a morphologic ﬁ xative. RNA later ﬁ xation pro-
duces unclear images with high background staining ( Cadoret 
et al., 2013 ) and reduces immunoﬂ uorescent signals ( Zaitoun 
et al., 2010 ;  Paul and Ferl, 2011 ). This intracellular occlusion 
eliminates the possibility of clear subcellular localizations.

 •  Premise of the study: In spaceﬂ ight experiments, tissues for morphologic study are ﬁ xed in 3% glutaraldehyde, while tissues 
for molecular study are ﬁ xed in RNA later ; thus, an experiment containing both study components requires multiple ﬁ xation 
strategies. The possibility of using RNA later -ﬁ xed materials for standard SEM-based morphometric investigation was ex-
plored to expand the library of tissues available for analysis and maximize usage of samples returned from spaceﬂ ight, but these 
technologies have wide application to any situation where recovery of biological resources is limited. 
 •  Methods and Results: RNA later -ﬁ xed samples were desalinated in distilled water, dehydrated through graded methanol, 
plunged into liquid ethane, and transferred to cryovials for freeze-substitution. Sample tissues were critical point dried, 
mounted, sputter-coated, and imaged. 
 •  Conclusions: The protocol resulted in acceptable SEM images from RNA later -ﬁ xed  Arabidopsis thaliana tissue. The majority 
of the tissues remained intact, including general morphology and ﬁ ner details such as root hairs and trichomes.

with CO 2 , followed by three 10-min inﬁ ltrations. One ﬁ nal exchange was per-
formed and left overnight. Two additional 10-min inﬁ ltrations were performed, 
followed by CPD with controlled venting. Samples were in solution until 
the end of CPD. Dry samples in baskets were transferred to a desiccant-ﬁ lled 
(Drierite; W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Xenia, Ohio, USA) sealable con-
tainer until being mounted on stubs using carbon adhesive and returned to a 
stub rack within a different desiccant-ﬁ lled sealable container. Mounted sam-
ples were sputter-coated for 90 s with a gold-palladium alloy (Desk V HP; Denton 
Vacuum, Moorestown, New Jersey, USA) and imaged on a scanning electron 
microscope (Hitachi S-4000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). 
 Initial observations were focused on roots, resolution of cell ﬁ les, and reten-
tion of root hairs throughout the processing of the tissue ( Fig. 2 ) . Later tests 
observed trichomes and more durable tissues, such as adaxial leaf surfaces and 
seed coats ( Fig. 2A–C ). The fresh-frozen tissues, used as protocol development 
control material, retained ﬁ ner details, including closed stomata and normal 
trichome morphology ( Fig. 2D, E ). RNA later -ﬁ xed test materials yielded simi-
lar images as the fresh-frozen plants, with minimal additional tissue damage 
( Fig. 2F–K ). 
 Spaceﬂ ight materials and the corresponding ground controls, both ﬁ xed in 
RNA later , were processed using the protocol discussed above and detailed 
in Appendix 1. Tissues yielded images of acceptable quality, with minimal cell 
wrinkling and high retention of ﬁ ne details ( Fig. 2J, K ). The focus of these 
samples was root structure, morphology, and root hair retention because of in-
teresting molecular and genetic observations from a recent spaceﬂ ight experi-
ment ( Paul et al., 2012 ; Paul et al., unpublished ). 
 Cost of the developed protocol is minimal, while the accessibility is high. 
Assuming the microscopy core to be used has standard SEM capability, the ad-
ditional cost of this protocol is merely the cost of consumables. These compo-
nents are readily available and likely already obtained by the laboratory 
interested in using this protocol. Another advantage of this protocol is a near 
retention of tissue morphology at a fresh harvest state. Not only are ﬁ ner elements 
of tissues retained ( Fig. 2D–I ), but other tissues, such as the adaxial leaf epider-
mis, seed coat, and ﬂ oral stalk ( Fig. 2A–C ), produce results comparable to those 
processed through dedicated morphologic means (e.g.,  Bhargava et al., 2013 ). 
The amount of time needed for this process is slightly longer than other stan-
dard SEM processing times, with an additional 4 h for the desalination washes 
and several days required for freeze substitution. Hand-plunged samples may 
be processed in batches to increase throughput, being limited to the number of 
samples able to be held with a pair of forceps without compromising structural 
integrity. Examples of other SEM protocols may be seen in  Liu et al. (2008) , 
 Koizumi et al. (2010) ,  Springer et al. (2010) , and  Yi et al. (2010) . As a result of 
this protocol, samples ﬁ xed with RNA later retained many ﬁ ne features includ-
ing root hairs and trichomes, with a majority of cells inﬂ ated and displaying 
fresh-frozen–like morphology, regardless of whether they were harvested dur-
ing spaceﬂ ight or on the ground. 
 CONCLUSIONS 
 The protocol presented here provides distinct advantages for 
both spaceﬂ ight and ground-based experimental applications. 
 Arabidopsis plants harvested on the International Space Station 
by astronauts were successfully retrieved from RNA later and 
processed to produce acceptable quality images without the use 
of a dedicated morphologic ﬁ xative ( Fig. 2J, K ). Field studies 
may also beneﬁ t from the use of this protocol. As in spaceﬂ ight, 
the amount of materials able to be carried and used during an 
expedition is limited. With the option of using one stable, safe 
chemical ﬁ xative for all desired studies to be conducted upon 
return, scientists in the ﬁ eld may be able to collect more data 
with fewer trips. This protocol may also assist laboratories with 
libraries of samples in RNA later by expanding the available 
techniques for study. 
 Alternative imaging techniques outside the scope of this 
investigation provide alternatives to this protocol. True cryo-
SEM would likely be an acceptable alternative (examples 
may be seen in  Koroleva et al., 2010 ;  Sarsby et al., 2012 ; and 
 Yu et al., 2013 ), though desalination of specimens prior to tis-
sue processing would still be beneﬁ cial. A second option is 
However, the external morphology appears to be preserved in a 
fresh-like state, which suggests that RNA later may be accept-
able for use in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two cases 
in the literature report the use of RNA later in a morphological 
investigation.  Behrendt et al. (2011) reported that coral covered 
in crustose coralline algae was ﬁ xed in RNA later , postﬁ xed in 
2% glutaraldehyde, rinsed in sodium cacodylate, and postﬁ xed 
again in OsO 4 prior to SEM investigations.  Hofer et al. (2012) 
used SEM in their study on ﬂ oral organs of  Clermontia species 
using RNA later as their main ﬁ xative with a hexamethyldisila-
zane drying step. In the current study, both of the above tech-
niques resulted in signiﬁ cant tissue damage in  Arabidopsis . 
 An alternative to ﬁ xation in SEM sample preparation is freez-
ing. Cryo-SEM does not require prior ﬁ xation, but instead pre-
serves tissues in a fresh-like state for imaging ( Koroleva et al., 
2010 ;  Sarsby et al., 2012 ;  Yu et al., 2013 ). However, few labo-
ratories have access to such equipment, and the equipment and 
operation can often be expensive. Therefore, this study inves-
tigated the possibility of emulating cryo-SEM on a standard 
SEM, a “cryo-analog,” where tissue would ﬁ rst be returned to a 
fresh-like state for freezing prior to imaging. 
 METHODS AND RESULTS 
 For process development, test samples of 9–12-d-old  A. thaliana var.  colum-
bia (Col-0) or Wassilewskija (WS) (The Arabidopsis Information Resource 
[TAIR], Columbus, Ohio, USA) were harvested into RNA later and ﬁ xed over-
night at ambient room temperature. Fixed plants, along with freshly harvested 
individuals of the same age, were washed in distilled water with gentle rocking 
for four 1-h increments. This washing step was designed to desalinate RNA lat-
er -ﬁ xed samples, as the salt crystals were found to damage tissue during subse-
quent steps ( Fig. 1A, B ) . Desalination also returned the plants to a fresh-like 
state ( Fig. 1C, D ) suitable for ﬂ ash-freezing. Tissues were dissected immedi-
ately following the ﬁ nal wash into 5–10-mm lengths to ﬁ t on the SEM sample 
stage (“stub”). 
 The ﬁ rst two protocols tested provided valuable lessons. The ﬁ rst cryo-
analog protocol was ﬂ ash freezing in liquid nitrogen (LN 2 ). Tissues were severely 
damaged, primarily due to rapid crystallization of water into ice, physically 
compromising cellular integrity. The second protocol tested was high-pressure 
freezing (HPF; Bal-Tec HPM100; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), 
which resulted in vitriﬁ ed ice and a greater freezing depth. The noncrystalline 
structure prevented physical damage, but the roots had a tendency to stick to the 
planchettes and break ( Fig. 1E, F ). 
 The third protocol tested was based on the lessons learned and resulted in 
minimal tissue damage. The risk of water–ice crystal formation and planchette 
adhesion was minimized using a variety of methods. Samples were run through 
a methanol dehydration gradient, starting at 10% and increasing at 10% inter-
vals, for 10 min at each step. An optional wash of 0.1% tannic acid in methanol 
was used to enhance electron density ( Mizuhira et al., 1972 ;  Roholl et al., 
1981 ).  Arabidopsis tissues were hand-plunged using forceps into LN 2 -cooled 
liquid ethane, which vitriﬁ ed any remaining water in each sample. These rapid 
hand-performed plunges provided more control and less damage than auto-
mated plunge devices. Samples were immediately transferred to LN 2 -cooled 
individual cryovials, containing either 2% OsO 4 in MeOH or 0.5% glutaralde-
hyde in 0.1% tannic acid. The headspace in each vial was ﬁ lled with LN 2 to 
prevent samples being lost or damaged due to static electric effects. Cryovials 
were placed into freeze substitution (Leica EM AFS2; Leica Microsystems) to 
increase the temperature to 10 ° C over the course of 4–10 d. Cryovial caps were 
left slightly loose to vent nitrogen gas. Once the temperature reached 10 ° C, 
cryovials were removed, opened, and tissues were transferred to tissue baskets 
(SPI microporous specimen capsules, 120–200  μ m pore size; Structure Probe 
Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) while submerged in chilled (4 ° C) 
methanol. This transfer took place at ambient room temperature; the chilled 
methanol submersion is enough to maintain the integrity of the tissues. Individual 
baskets were labeled using pencil on a small piece of paper approximately 
2 mm 2 , as external labels were removed during the drying phase. Drying oc-
curred via liquid CO 2 critical point drying (CPD; Bal-Tec CPD 030; Leica Micro-
systems). Eleven quick-cycled washes replaced most of the loading methanol

 Hansma et al., 1989 ;  Ushiki et al., 2012 ). Due to the high ionic 
content of RNA later and the necessity for an ionic submersion 
liquid for SICM, it is possible that this instrument could gen-
erate comparable images without any tissue processing. This

be an acceptable alternative step in this protocol if the SEM 
being used can handle the LN 2 vapors. A third alternative is

 The protocol reported here will likely require optimization 
for each desired tissue to be tested.  Arabidopsis is a very fragile 
tissue, with limited ﬂ at surfaces and small organ sizes. Other 
plants that may be more robust may tolerate a rougher tech-
nique, while more fragile tissues (i.e., ﬂ oral tissues) may need 
a more gentle approach. Some potential additional steps to 
enhance tissue integrity include a postﬁ xation step or revers-
ing CPD and sputter-coating. A postﬁ xation step (as seen in 
 Behrendt et al., 2011 ), which would take place after the desali-
nation, could improve tissue integrity during the cryo-analog 
plunge, especially if ﬁ xatives for electron microscopy, such as 
Karnovsky’s or OsO 4 , are used. Sputter-coating prior to CPD 
(as seen in  Yi et al., 2010 ) may also improve the physical tissue 
integrity, though both mounting prior to CPD and pulling a 
vacuum during the coating process may prove difﬁ cult. 
 The use of this protocol provides more morphological op-
portunities for samples that would have previously been wasted 
due to improper ﬁ xation. It is designed to be a supplement to 
rather than a replacement of SEM standard practices. Although
