Error in Figure
The authors wish to make the following corrections to Figure 10 of this paper [1]:
In the original publication, there is a mistake in the bar graph of Figure 10 as published.
At the moment of uploading the manuscript, we chose the wrong legend version.
It should say Tf for transferrin (instead of Fer for ferritin, as published). The ﬁgure as
is makes no sense because this section is about the two speciﬁc markers Tf and GPDH.
Swapping the ﬁgure will correct the information without altering the data, contents or
caption. The text and caption for the entire ﬁgure discuss transferrin (Tf) and the correct
graph is pasted below.
 
Figure 10. Views of GC-OLPs (A–C) or SPC-OLPs (D–F) two weeks after being seeded. (A) Most GC-OLPs
expressed Tf in their cytoplasm (inset and arrow). (B) They also co-expressed GPDH. (C) Merged view

of both markers that colocalized. (D) Tf was expressed by all cells in their nuclei rather than the
cytoplasm. (E) Most of these cells were weakly labeled for GPDH, and only those that had undergone
karyokinesis or in the process of cytokinesis displayed nuclear GPDH expression. (F) Merged view
of both markers. (G) This bar graph shows the percentage of the markers expressed alone or co-
expressed by OLPs. In the GC group, 34% co-expressed both OL markers. Only 51% expressed
transferrin alone, and 41% expressed GPDH only. In the case of SPC-OLPs, only 58% co-expressed Tf
in the nucleus and cytoplasmic GPDH, although the GPDH expression was faint and it colocalized in
the nucleus only in cells that had undergone karyokinesis and those that appeared to be undergoing
cytokinesis. Only 2.2% of these OLPs expressed GPDH alone, indicative of their immature stage with
respect to GC cells. The data are shown both in cell numbers and percentages. Statistical signiﬁcance
was assessed by one-way ANOVA, in which p < 0.05 was deﬁned as statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.01).
An orthogonal image of the localization of Tf is shown in Supplemental Figure S4.
The authors state that the scientiﬁc conclusions are unaffected. This correction was
approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated.
