ABSTRACT
The mission of NASA’s GeneLab database (https:
//genelab.nasa.gov/) is to collect, curate, and pro-
vide access to the genomic, transcriptomic, pro-
teomic and metabolomic (so-called ‘omics’) data
from biospecimens ﬂown in space or exposed to sim-
ulated space stressors, maximizing their utilization.
This large collection of data enables the exploration
of molecular network responses to space environ-
ments using a systems biology approach. We review
here the various components of the GeneLab plat-
form, including the new data repository web inter-
face, and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE)
web portal, which will support the expansion of the
database in the future to include companion non-
omics assay data. We discuss our design for GEODE,
particularly how it promotes investigators providing
more accurate metadata, reducing the curation effort
required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here
a new GeneLab Application Programming Interface
(API) speciﬁcally designed to support tools for the
visualization of processed omics data. We review the
outreach efforts by GeneLab to utilize the spaceﬂight
data in the repository to generate novel discoveries
and develop new hypotheses, including spearhead-
ing data analysis working groups, and a high school
student training program. All these efforts are aimed
ultimately at supporting precision risk management
for human space exploration.
INTRODUCTION
Scientists are leveraging space-based platforms such as the
International Space Station (ISS) and earth-based labora-
tories such as the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory to
study the effects of space on biological organisms, generat-
ing nucleic acid, protein, and metabolite profiling data at
an unprecedented rate. The 2011 National Research Coun-
cil (NRC) Decadal Survey presaged this ‘wave of change’
almost a decade ago, and called for the development of
more powerful informatics technologies to meet the grow-
ing needs of these researchers (1). The Survey also pro-
mulgated the use of a systems biology approach by space
biosciences investigators, which led to the formation of the
GeneLab project (https://genelab.nasa.gov/), a science ini-
tiative at NASA to maximize omics data collected from
spaceflight and ground simulation experiments, and includ-
ing the creation in 2014 of the NASA GeneLab data repos-
itory (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/ ) (1). The mis-
sion of GeneLab is to maximize the utilization of valu-
able biospecimens flown in space or exposed to simulated
space stressors through the collection and curation of ge-
nomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic (so-
called ‘omics’) data, in order to enable the exploration of
molecular network responses to space environments us-
ing a systems biology approach. Our designs for the data
repository continue to be guided by the FAIR principles
(2,3). To foster open science in space biology research and
to stimulate research opportunities based on an integrated
multi-omics analysis approach, investigators who gener-
ate omics data are encouraged to contact GeneLab for
the latest information concerning data submission require-
ments and procedures. All GeneLab repository data are
open-access.
We review here the various components (Figure 1) of the
database, then describe its new data repository web inter-
face and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) web
portal, which provides ‘self-service’ data curation, and will
support the expansion of the database in the future to in-
clude companion non-omics assay data. We discuss our de-
sign strategies for GEODE, emphasizing how they promote
investigators providing more accurate metadata using con-
trolled vocabularies, reducing the curation effort required
of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab

the GeneLab Data Systems: the database web browser interface (A), the GeneLab Online Data Entry tool (B), a workspace tool for private data sharing
(C), and the GeneLab data visualization server (D). The database API is also being used to power various extramural data analytics and visualization tools
(E, F). The GeneLab Public Analytics platform (G) and Data Processing systems (H) access the repository data files directly.
Application Programming Interface (API) specifically de-
signed to support tools for the visualization of processed
omics data. Such visualization tools are essential to fulfil an
‘Open Science’ mandate, democratizing the access to data
and allowing the scientific community at large to gain new
knowledge on how spaceflight affects life, from humans and
mice, to plants and microbes.
GENELAB DATABASE HOLDINGS
As of August 2020, GeneLab houses data from 271 stud-
ies representing investigations of many kinds of spaceflight
experimental factors: gravity level (microgravity, hypergrav-
ity), ionizing radiation, circadian disruption, and atmo-
spheric pressure, together with information on confounding
variables such as organism diet, age, and sample preserva-
tion methods, for a variety of biological organisms (Figure
2). Approximately half the studies in the GeneLab reposi-
tory are from experiments conducted in space, and the other
half from ground-based (space analogue) environments (4).
Mammalian (primarily rodent and human cell line) investi-
gations account for a majority the studies. Other organisms
studied include various flowering plants, (e.g. Arabidopsis
thaliana), microbes, nematodes (primarily Caenorhabditis
elegans), insects (Drosophila melanogaster), and bony fish.
Although, the most prevalent study assay type is transcrip-
tion profiling, the database also includes studies of protein
expression, whole genome sequencing, metabolite profiling,
metagenomics, epigenomics and epitranscriptomics. Inves-
tigators continue to submit data from new kinds of assays at
an ever-increasing rate, particularly new kinds of RNA se-
quencing assays, such as spatial transcription profiling (5)
data (6). Accommodating these new kinds of assays have
not required GeneLab data systems software development,
only minor changes to systems configuration files.
DATA PROCESSING STANDARDIZATION
Since its inception GeneLab has focused on adopting best
practices regarding the use of community-derived standards
for metadata and data processing. For submitted meta-
data, GeneLab curators encourage the use of domain on-
tologies, and meticulously, manually harmonize submitted
metadata with those of existing studies (1). To support con-
sistent interpretation of submitted data, GeneLab curators
augment submitted metadata for spaceflight studies with
spacecraft environmental metadata. For example, for exper-
iments conducted on board the U.S. Space Transportation
System (the ‘Space Shuttle’), on the ISS, and on board var-
ious other spacecraft, GeneLab has gathered, summarized,
and attached radiation exposure metadata to the other ex-
periment metadata submitted by investigators (4). Ambi-
ent CO2, temperature, and humidity data are also gathered,
summarized, and associated with each sample for metadata
submitted for ISS experiments.
GeneLab has also begun to process submitted transcrip-
tomic data using consensus pipelines developed by repre-
sentatives of the space biology community (https://github.
com/nasa/GeneLab Data Processing). This yields gene ex-
pression analysis data that are then made available in the
database together with the raw data, and all intermedi-
ate data processing files. At the time of this writing, 103

KEY DATABASE FEATURES
When originally designed, the GeneLab data systems
sought merely to replicate features of existing, publicly-
available life sciences data repositories that have long been
recognized as valuable to end-users. These included the use
of persistent, immutable accession numbers for submitted
data, completely open access, and an API to allow for data
file and metadata retrieval. Since this original design sev-
eral years ago, GeneLab has sought to improve on this set
of features, and implement new ones in line with advancing
end-user needs and new, community-derived design princi-
ples for data repositories.
User interface
The initial user interface for the data repository organized
study metadata using a series of tabs, one each for adminis-
trative, protocol, sample, and assay metadata. However, this
layout makes it difficult for users to see more than one ac-
tive tab’s content at the same time. We have since revised the
layout to use navigable, movable, and collapsible sections
for each kind of metadata (Figure 3) so that users can cre-
ate custom displays to organize and view the exact kind of
metadata they want.
Increased FAIRness
Digital object identifiers.
From its inception, GeneLab has
sought to implement community-derived (i.e. open) stan-
dards for the data and metadata it curates, and for the op-
eration of the database (end-user interactions, curation by
GeneLab, etc.). Largely concurrent with the design of the
GeneLab Data Repository, the global scientific community
converged on a set of optimal design features for data repos-
itories, now termed the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, In-
teroperability, and Reusability) principles. In the area of
Findability, the data repository now provides Digital Ob-
ject Identifiers (DOIs) for all submitted datasets. DOIs have
guaranteed persistence, and resolution control mechanisms
that are centralized (independent of the data source), and
provide users of the GeneLab datasets with a way to cite
them easily and uniformly. In addition, each version of a
dataset (distinguished by changes in data files or in meta-
data) is tracked in the data repository, and users can opt
to see previous versions through the web interface (Figure
3). This ensures persistence of the specific version of data
as cited by others. Finally, NASA is currently developing
processes for the automated submission to other databases
of data submitted first to GeneLab, with the twin goals of
making the data more findable from extramural database
systems, and reducing the burden to data providers of gen-
erating multiple data submissions.
Accessibility.
All data in the GeneLab data repository
continues to be accessible to all users without user authenti-
cations. To provide the greatest accessibility to its data anal-
ysis tools and collaborative workspace, the GeneLab analy-
sis and collaboration platforms have integrated the widely-
available Google credentialing system into its authentica-
tion systems. Users can opt to use their Google-managed
credentials or, if they have them, use their NASA creden-

tials to access these subsystems. It is our intention that this
development leads to increased access to and usage of these
tools for more investigators.
Linked data.
One the biggest areas where many data
repositories fall short using FAIR-based metrics is interop-
erability (2), which often presents a barrier to data reusabil-
ity. In order to support systems interoperation and increase
data reuse, the GeneLab repository data uses the widely
known ISA experiment model (7) for tagging data files with
metadata. The ISA model leverages community-developed
concept vocabularies (ontologies), so that there is agree-
ment among users on metadata meaning, and therefore data
characterization. Furthermore these models support link-
age of data values (‘linked data’) so that, for example, bio-
logical samples, personnel or resources reused across experi-
ments need only be described once by the first experiment to
refer to them. Subsequent investigations that also use these
objects then can quickly search for and refer to them in their
investigation descriptions.
In the specific domain of space biology, it is common to
re-use samples across different investigations, given the high
cost of generating biological sample data in space environ-
ments. In many other application areas, it is common to re-
use parts of experimental protocols, and these too can be
similar referred to by data submitters using the ISA model,
rather than duplicated semantically in the data repository.
Web-browser data submissions.
The most recent addition
to the GeneLab Data Systems is GEODE, the GeneLab
Environment for Online Data Entry. This interface sup-
ports the creation of complex metadata descriptions of
datasets, and was built in collaboration with, and by ex-
tending an interface originally developed by, the Metabo-
lights (8) database at EBI. This web browser interface (Fig-
ure 4) allows users to develop ISA-tab sets of metadata
through either a guided submission ‘wizard’, in which users
create metadata step-by-step, or ‘Study Overview’ method,
in which metadata can be arbitrarily edited. Data submit-
ters and GeneLab curation staff can both create metadata
using GEODE; submitters are limited to editing only their
own submitted metadata, while GeneLab curation staff can
access and edit all metadata. The web interface provides the
capability for submitters (or curators) to look up metadata
concepts in online ontologies dynamically, which reduces
metadata normalization effort of the curation staff. Fur-
thermore, GEODE provides continuously available data
set editing for submitters (or curators), so that they can
rapidly and efficiently update and correct their data; any
data set owner (or curator) can change the status of their
published data sets to ‘In Review’, make changes to the
data/metadata, and re-submit it for release at any time.
Enhanced API.
GeneLab has always provided an Applica-
tion Programming Interface (API) for the retrieval of indi-
vidual experiment data and metadata files. Improvements
in this API now enables users to query the database for
samples, potentially across multiple datasets and assays,
by combinations of values of metadata fields, and then to
retrieve sample-associated experiment data. Both the data
and the accompanying annotations are returned in a tabu-
lar format suitable for downstream processing in a variety of

languages and environments commonly used by data scien-
tists. This, in turn, empowers researchers to conduct multi-
dataset and multi-omics analyses, such as investigating the
impact of single experiment factors on a variety of organ-
isms during space flight. For example, the API can be lever-
aged to interrogate the entirety of the GeneLab database
for RNA-Seq assay gene expression counts from all sam-
ples from Mus musculus that experienced a specified level of
ionizing radiation; such a request returns gene counts from
multiple datasets as well as all other metadata values associ-
ated with the samples (status of space flight, radiation dose,
diet, age, etc.), immediately providing the end-user with
data and annotations suitable to build a complex model that
accounts for all main and confounding factors known to the
database. The API also supports queries for multiple assay
types, for example, all transcriptomic and epigenomic as-
says, facilitating multi-omics data analyses. This enhanced
API layer is currently being leveraged within GeneLab to
provide advanced data visualizations of GeneLab processed
data (9). These include a data table browser for sample
data and annotations, and common statistical data visu-
alizations such as principal component analysis, in a web-
browser interface. Finally, we should note that, as the data
API leverages the versatile ISA-Tab format to bring anno-
tations to data files, this API could be easily extended to
numerous types of assay data, not just omics.
COMMUNITY
Scientific outreach
A key goal of the GeneLab project is to bring together a
community of scientists to generate novel hypotheses and
make valuable scientific discoveries using the data in the
GeneLab database. GeneLab has sought to engage working
groups of students, bioinformaticians, space biologists, re-
searchers and citizen scientists by providing freely-available
data analysis tools and support for their use. Users can ac-
cess user guides and tutorial videos on how to use the vari-
ous GeneLab applications, including how to analyze RNA-
seq datasets using the GeneLab Analysis Platform (https://
genelab.nasa.gov/help/tutorials). Furthermore, NASA has
developed the GeneLab 4 High School (GL4HS) train-
ing program, in which fifteen high school students learn
how to use the GeneLab tools over four weeks to ana-
lyze spaceflight microarray and RNA-seq data, how to gen-
erate follow-on hypotheses based on these analyses, how
to design a ground-based experiment to test these hy-
potheses, and ultimately write research proposals for the
experiments (https://www.nasa.gov/ames/genelab-for-high-
schools). GeneLab is also launching an Education Working
Group, a group of educators and scientists, who will develop
educational content that promotes the use of the GeneLab
database, and its visualization and analytical tools.

D1520 Nucleic Acids Research, 2021, Vol. 49, Database issue
Analysis working groups
In 2018 GeneLab formed four Analysis Working Groups
(AWGs) comprised of over 100 scientists and students from
multiple space agencies, academia, and industry, for the
purpose of optimizing and standardizing the processing of
raw omics data from the GeneLab repository. The AWGs
work in four major areas: animal, plant, microbial, and
multi-omics data processing. The consensus data process-
ing pipelines developed in each group are then used by
GeneLab to process the data in the repository (see Data
Processing Standardization above). The AWGs have begun
to utilize the processed data to publish insights in important
areas of space biology (10–14).
Data re-use
The number of GeneLab studies continue to grow rapidly,
providing more opportunities for meta-analysis. Currently
there are 18 publications of this type linked to reposi-
tory datasets that together leveraged 78 repository datasets
(see https://genelab.nasa.gov/publications/derived). In ad-
dition, an increasing number of extramural visualization
tools are consuming the processed data in the repository
through its API. For example, the Test of Arabidopsis
Space Transcriptome (TOAST) tool has a graphical user
interface through which users can quickly compare the
data from plant spaceflight experiments using real-time,
gene-specific queries, or explore gene networks of inter-
est (15). Likewise, Project MANGO (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/
metagenomics/super-studies/3) users can generate and visu-
alize taxonomic analyses of GeneLab processed data to ex-
plore the microbiome of the ISS.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Astronaut data
In 2011 the National Research Council of the U.S. rec-
ognized the importance of collecting astronaut data, in
addition to model organism data in the Decadal Survey
(16): ‘because of the limited number of humans who un-
dergo exposure to the space environment, maintaining an
extensive and well-organized database and managing it as
a resource to be shared with the scientific community has
long been viewed as an essential step for scientific dis-
covery’. However, anonymizing astronaut data presents a
unique challenge as the cohort is indeed extremely small,
and very few metadata (e.g. just gender and flight dates)
may be used to identify individuals. Nevertheless, to achieve
greater reuse of these data, they too should be made part of
an Open Science framework using FAIR principles. They
should be stored in non-proprietary formats based on open
(community-derived) standards, with open access and with
linkages to other data that provide important context (17).
This goal was nicely summarized by Higman et al. (17),
‘data should be as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.
More effort should be put into identifying what types of
data can remain open, even if one can identify the indi-
viduals to which they belong. For example, gene expression
levels do not present any sensitive information in the con-
text of the response to stresses like microgravity and radia-
tion. Such information should therefore be made available
through open science frameworks as soon as these data are
released for publication by investigators. Any information
revealing sensitive and personal information, such as that
which can be derived from DNA or RNA sequences, would
remain access-controlled.
Enabling precision space risk management
Although valuable knowledge has been gained from experi-
ments conducted in space or from space simulations on the
ground, little progress has been made in terms of modelling
the impact of spaceflight on humans. Most risk models have
been focusing on space radiation and cancer (18–20). The
strong epidemiological data on cancer risk from ionizing
radiation (21) and the existence of accelerators dedicated
to simulating space radiation have been the main thrust be-
hind these risk models. Ionizing radiation is an easy-to-use
experimental factor, with good quantitative input and out-
put, enabling mathematical models. Briefly, scientists con-
trol precisely the dose, the dose rate and the type of radi-
ation delivered and they can measure precisely short-term
endpoints such as DNA double strand breaks (22,23). In-
terestingly, such responses have been shown to be modu-
lated by the genetic background of an individual (24–26),
eventually leading to DNA mutations and cancer (27–29).
Because modelling requires quantitative data, omics data
are very well suited to informing risk models and to tack-
ling more challenging stressors such as microgravity. The
growing amount of omics data generated by NASA princi-
pal investigators and the recent guidelines from NASA em-
phasizing the importance of submitting all omics data to
GeneLab are therefore exciting developments for modellers.
Indeed, the software architecture designed by GeneLab and
its strategies around data and metadata harmonization will
enable the development of the next generation of space risk
models. By classifying experimental factors into digital ob-
jects and by transforming raw data into comparable quan-
titative endpoints using a workflow approved by the com-
munity, GeneLab lets users see how space factors affect
a large array of biological processes (13,30–32). By estab-
lishing mathematical laws describing the relationship be-
tween factors’ values and biological endpoints, one can start
building more elaborate computer models. By integrating
information from other NASA databases with more qual-
itative data (e.g. immunocytochemistry, behavioural data)
using the same metadata schema and harmonization strate-
gies, GeneLab can continue to evolve as a knowledge-based
system, fully leveraging advances in machine learning, pro-
viding insights on enabling human life in space, and en-
abling individualized space risk models for precision space
medicine.
GeneLab plans to utilize machine learning algorithms
and artificial intelligence (AI) to maximize the usage of its
data, especially in the context of modelling and extrapo-
lation to human risks. Such effort may start by providing
a portal proposing mechanistic models describing known
health risks (cancer, muscle atrophy, bone loss, etc.). Such
a tool would allow users to test how well GeneLab omics
data and data from other databases support these mod-
els and test alternative models. Such approach will involve
collaborating with the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data

omics data from mammalian and microbial NASA experi-
ments.
