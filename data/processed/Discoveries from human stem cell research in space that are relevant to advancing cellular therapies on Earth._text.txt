Discoveries from human stem cell
research in space that are relevant to
advancing cellular therapies on Earth

& Abba C. Zubair
Stem cell research performed in space has provided fundamental insights into stem cell properties and
behavior in microgravity including cell proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration capabilities.
However, there is broader scientiﬁc value to this research including potential translation of stem cell
research in space to clinical applications. Here, we present important discoveries from different
studies performed in space demonstrating the potential use of human stem cells as well as the
limitations in cellular therapeutics. A full understanding of the effects of microgravity in space on
potentially supporting the expansion and/or enhancement of stem cell function is required to translate
the ﬁndings into clinics.
Over the last two decades, there have been tremendous advancements in
stem cell biology within regenerative medicine as well as innovations in
space technologies. The International Space Station (ISS) has been
increasingly supportive of academic and commercial groups using micro-
gravityfor research and product development with potential beneﬁts foruse
on Earth1,2. There is a growing interest in evaluating the potential for stem
cells and their derived tissues in space to model human disease mechanisms
and treat diseases through cell therapy.
At the start of human spaceﬂight, the primary focus of life science
research conducted in space was to understand the physiological effects of
the spaceﬂight environment including microgravity on humans to keep
them alive and well in this extreme environment. Additionally, medical
research in space has uncovered valuable evidence about the effects of
microgravity on the human condition including biological processes and
disease pathways. A great wealth of knowledge about cells and tissues has
been known in biomedical space research. In recent years, there has been an
emerging interest from scientists, governments, and commercial entities to
investigate human health in space for the beneﬁt of humans on Earth too.

other than Earth, revealing mechanisms which would otherwise be unde-
tected or unknown with the inevitable presence of normal gravity. This
includes changes to stem cell proliferation rates, differentiation, and lineage
phenotypes3–6. Stem cell research performed in space has shown potential
ways microgravity can be leveraged to advance cellular therapeuticsin space
to beneﬁt human life and commercial enterprise on Earth7. This paper
reviews important discoveries that have occurred in real microgravity
conditions on the ISS demonstrating the impact of microgravity on fun-
damental stem cell properties relevant to regenerative medicine practices
and therapeutics on Earth3,8–14. We present here different areas of stem cell
research conducted in space that have potential to translate to terrestrial
applications within the context of developing cellular therapies while also
highlighting the limitations and opposing evidence available. Prior to these
spaceﬂight studies, little was known about the role of microgravity in
inﬂuencing human stem cell growth and fate. We are just starting to
understand the ways in which a microgravity environment inﬂuences stem
cell function, division, and survival.
Stem cell studies in space and their potential
application
The main types of stem cells used in clinical and experimental cell therapy
are pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells include
embryonic stem cells, epiblast stem cells, embryonic germ cells and induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs are specialized human stem cells
created in the lab from a person’s blood or skin cells and can generatenearly
any cell in the body, and hence, can be used in regenerative medicine
therapies. They are derived from direct reprogramming of postnatal/adult
somatic cells in vitro. They also carry an individual’s own DNA making
them ideal for creating tailored treatments for diseases and are essential in
the ﬁeld of personalized medicine. Currently, the clinical use of pluripotent
stem cells largely lacks therapeutic evidence and is constrained to investi-
gational regenerative medicine15–17. As for adult stem cells, they are rare,
undifferentiated stem cells which replenish cells and contribute to growth
and repair of tissue by giving rise to progenitor cells which differentiate into
the required cell types. Adult stem cells include hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skin stem cells (SSCs) and neural
stem cells (NSCs)18. With current tissue engineering technologies and

advancements in gene editing techniques, stem cells can be remodeled into
three-dimensional organoids and tissue structures, further exacerbating
their use in personalized regenerative applications19.
Stem cell-based therapies are a possible treatment for age-related
conditions including stroke, dementia, neurodegenerative diseases, and
cancer, among other conditions and injuries. However, such treatments
may require large amounts of stem cells, and this is difﬁcult to achieve since
expanding stem cells for therapies remains a challenge20. One of the most
important factors inﬂuencing therapeutic effects of stem cells is their culture
environment, including presence or absence of gravitational forces.
Microgravity is recognized as a novel culture environment for stemcells as a
result of the unique changes which can occur in a microgravity culture4.
Different research groups around the world have been working on
expandingstemcells inspaceforuse in terrestrialstudies and practices. This
is a result of the advantages that the microgravity environment provides to
cells in space. The goal of almost all these spaceﬂight studies is to enhance
growth of large amounts of safe and high-quality clinical-grade stem cells
with minimal cell differentiation. The studies also evaluate the feasibility of
successful harvest and transport of the space expanded stem cells back to
Earth. Optimizing these experiments and creating standardized protocols
can enable the growth of stem cells in space for patient use on Earth.
The space environment offers an advantage to the growth of stem cells
by providing a more natural three-dimensional (3D) state for their expan-
sion which closely resembles growth of cells in the human body, in com-
parison to the two-dimensional (2D) culture environment available on
Earth which less likely imitates real tissue21. A 3D cell culture system better
mimics the behaviors and reactions of cells in vivo than 2D systems by
simulating native cell-cell interactions and development. Therefore, scien-
tists are interested in the effects of microgravity in creating a 3D cell culture
system for stem cells by ofﬂoading the gravitational forces exerted on cells
and replicating physiological composition of cells and their spatial
arrangements22. Different types of stem cells have been sent into space to
assesswhetherspaceisinfactanidealplatformtoproducelargequantitiesof
stem cells and eventually improve treatments on Earth.
Types of stem cells studied in space
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cardi-
omyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs),
cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) have
been sent to the ISS and returned for analysis. Their phenotypic and
functional characteristics including their biology, stemness, and fate choice
towards speciﬁc lineages were evaluated to ensure their maintenance of
identity and safety (Table 1). These stem cells are vital for stem cell therapy
including bone marrow transplant for the treatment of bone or blood
cancers, and helping patients recover neurons and blood vessels after a
stroke. Successfully growing stem cells in space and maintaining their
stemness without differentiation into other downstream lineages while
bringing them back to Earth in good condition can make these cells feasible
for use in patients in the future (Fig. 1).
Mesenchymal stem cells
MSCsareknowntohavepotentialastherapeuticagents.However,theirsafe
andefﬁcientexpansionwhilemaintainingstemcellpropertiesisstillamajor
challenge in the ﬁeld23. Nonetheless, a study conducted by Huang et al.8
evaluated the feasibility, potency, and safety of growing human bone mar-
row derived MSCs in space for potential future clinical applications. The
MSCs were grown on the ISS for two weeks and different analyses were
performed on them after their return to Earth. The results of this study
showed that MSCs maintained their phenotype and proliferative char-
acteristics after expansion on the ISS, prior microgravity exposure did not
inﬂuence MSC differentiation abilities, and several cytokines and growth
factors were signiﬁcantly altered by microgravity and dependent on dura-
tion of exposure. MSCs grown in space showed enhanced immunosup-
pressive capabilities compared to those cultured on Earth. Also, no evidence
of malignant transformation or genomic integrity compromise were found
as demonstrated via the chromosomal, DNA damage and tumorigenicity
assays8.
Furthermore, it is hypothesized that MSC cultures maintained in
microgravity may be used for cell-based therapy in diseases of the central
nervous system. Results collected via gene expression proﬁling from the
experiment “Stroma-2” performed aboard the ISS showed that in-space
mousebonemarrow-derivedMSCshadhigherexpressionofgenesinvolved
in neural development, neuron morphogenesis, and transmission of nerve
impulse and synapse than MSCs grown on Earth24. Also, human MSCs
culturedinsimulatedmicrogravitydemonstratedtherapeuticpropertiesina
mouse model of acute injury via signiﬁcantly higher expression of anti-
inﬂammatory and anti-apoptotic factors compared to MSCs cultured in
normal gravity25. Brain-injured mice that were transplanted with MSCs
cultured in microgravity showed greater motor functional recovery than
those transplanted with MSCs cultured in normal gravity26. Similarly, rat
bonemarrow-derived MSCscultured insimulated microgravitywhich were
transplanted into a rat model of spinal cord injury showed enhanced
functional improvement and therapeutic effects27. Although the detailed
mechanisms remain unclear, the results of these various stem cell trans-
plantation studies demonstrate the beneﬁts of using simulated microgravity
as part of the culture experimental design to enhance therapeutic effects of
MSCs using cell-based therapy for central nervous system diseases.
Nonetheless, simulated microgravity has been shown to inhibit the
migration of rat MSCs28 and suppress the differentiation of human
MSCs6,29,30, mouse MSCs26, and rat MSCs27,31. Suppression of differentiation
under microgravity may alter generation of multiple tissue lineages in
space32. However, inhibition of differentiation of MSCs preserves their
stemness and allows them to maintain their stem cell identity. This could
help expand thecellsinspaceforclinicalapplication onEarth.Furthermore,
simulated microgravity has been seen to inhibit proliferation of MSCs in
some studies31 and show increased proliferation compared to those cultured
in normal gravity in others6. Therefore, conﬂicting data is present on the
behavior of MSCs in microgravity, and hence, their potential beneﬁts in
stem cell-based therapy needs to be further explored.
Hematopoietic stem cells
HSCs are primarily found in the bone marrow and give rise to all mature
blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets33. The
effects of spaceﬂight on human HSC proliferation and differentiation were
explored in vitro via culture of CD34+ bone marrow-derived cells in sus-
pension for 11 days during the space shuttle mission STS-63 (Discovery)
and 13 days during STS-69 (Endeavour). Compared to ground control
samples, the in-space HSCs exhibited a signiﬁcant decline in the growth of
myeloid and erythroid progenitor cell numbers. The in-space HSCs also
showed an absolute increase in terminally differentiated macrophages,
suggesting accelerated differentiation towards the macrophage lineage. The
studyindicatesthattheproliferationanddifferentiationofHSCsisimpacted
by microgravity with erythropoiesis being particularly sensitive to changes
in gravity. Therefore, gravity may play a key role in certain pathways and
biological processes of in vitro hematopoiesis9. Additionally, these ﬁndings
suggest that spaceﬂight anemia may be a result of suppression of ery-
thropoiesis by microgravity, among other factors9,34,35. The reduced differ-
entiation observed within in-space HSCs suggests that microgravity may
play a role in preserving the stemness of HSCs, and hence, may be used as
HSC therapy in which they can be given to patients to produce functional
and terminally differentiated cells. It remains to be established that space
expanded HSC can produce functional and terminally differentiated
hematopoietic cells on Earth.
On the contrary, a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of mouse bone
marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells was reported during
12 days of spaceﬂight and simulated microgravity, mainly by blocking cell
cycle at G1/S transition. However, their differentiation abilities were not
affected36. In addition to this, a study which analyzed peripheral blood
samples from six astronauts who had participated in spaceﬂight missions
found signiﬁcant changesin several cell populations at different time points,

strategies to be developed for spaceﬂight-induced cardiac
remodeling and other conditions found on Earth.

including HSCs. The changesto lineage cells and HSCs were further studied
in a mouse model, using hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, and
found a reduction in frequency of NK cells, B cells, and erythrocyte pre-
cursorsinthebonemarrowandincreaseinfrequencyofTcells,neutrophils,
and HSCs.Deep sequencing showed changes in the expression of regulatory
molecules important for the differentiation of HSCs, and hence, their
ﬁndings demonstrated that spaceﬂight and simulated microgravity may
disrupt the homeostasis of immune system and cause dynamic changes to
both HSCs and lineage cells37. Additionally, simulated microgravity was
shown to signiﬁcantly inhibit the migration potential, cell-cycle progression
and differentiation patterns in primitive HSC38 and impair DNA damage
repair in human HSCs39. Profound changes to HSCs may limit their
applications in stem cell-based therapies.
Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells
The heart has limited ability in regenerating lost cardiomyocytes following
an adverse event like a heart attack40,41. However, cardiomyocytes derived
from human iPSCs may be a potential solution to replacing lost and dead
cells in such an event. Wnorowski et al. 2019 analyzed human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) following
5.5 weeks of culture in space on the ISS. Analysis of gene expression,
structure, and functions of these cells in comparison with ground control
hiPSC-CMs was done. The differences observed include changes in calcium
handling while RNA-sequencing showed differential expression of 2635
genes among ﬂight, post-ﬂight, and ground control samples, speciﬁcally
upregulated genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. No signiﬁcant
differences in cell morphology or sarcomere structure between spaceﬂight
and ground control samples were seen. This study demonstrated the use of
hiPSC-CMs to model the effects of microgravity in space, showing that the
cells change their functional properties in spaceﬂight and compensate for
the reduction in gravity by altering their gene expression patterns at the
cellularlevel.Also,thisstudydemonstratedthesuccessfulcultureandreturn
of viable cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs which may pose potential
therapeutic use10.
Additionally, another study investigated hiPSC-CMs in space, starting
with hiPSC-cardiac progenitors. Cryopreserved 3D hiPSC-cardiac pro-
genitors differentiated into cardiomyocytes and showed 3-fold largersphere
sizes, 20-fold higher counts of nuclei, and increased expression of pro-
liferation markers compared to ground control samples, following three
weeks on the ISS. In-space hiPSC-CMs also demonstrated increased
expression of contraction-associated genes and enhanced calcium handling.
Transient exposure to microgravity (3 days) showed upregulation in genes
involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and contraction11.
Therefore, the successful expansion of hiPSC-CMs derived from hiPSC-
cardiac progenitors in space resulted in efﬁcient production of highly
enriched cardiomyocytes with the required features for function, and thus,
may present potential therapeutic applications. These ﬁndings are sup-
ported by another study in which cardiac spheres derived from hiPSCs in
simulated microgravity culture showed enhanced production of highly
enriched cardiomyocytes (99% purity) with high viability (90%), upregu-
lation of genes associated with proliferation and survival and expected
functional properties5. During iPSC generation, the gravity-inducedtension

easier for stem cells to multiply quicker.
Cardiovascular progenitor cells
Cardiac regeneration is limited due to insufﬁcient numbers of cardiovas-
cular progenitor cells (CPCs), low self-renewal potency and production of
immature cardiomyocytes, among other reasons42. Current clinical trials
which stimulate repair in damaged heart tissue are promising43,44 but are
limited as a result of cells failing to engraft into the host tissue and use of
progenitorcells restricted in potency45.CPCsarecapable of self-renewaland
differentiation into the three main cell types of cardiac tissue including
cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells46. Therefore,

• Adult CPCs co-expressed several markers of early cardiovascular
differentiation.
• Adult CPCs expressed higher YAP1 levels in µG, especially after 12
days, but this declined at 30 days.
• Adult CPCs maintained their viability and proliferative capabilities.

during spaceﬂight may have implications for enhancing their regenerative
potential for stem cell-based cardiac repair. CPCs shift from silent to active
phases during processes of tissue regeneration which contributes to their
differentiation into new myocytes and endothelial cells47.
On the ISS, neonatal and adult CPCs were cultured, and both showed
increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, and
enhanced migration. Changes in cytoskeletal modiﬁcations as a result of
reduced mechanotransduction were reported3,12. The ﬁndings showed that
neonatal CPCs exhibited increased expression of early developmental
markers and proliferative potential while adult CPCs did not3. An increased
understanding of the response of CPCs to microgravity in space and
identiﬁcation of novel targets for enhancing therapies can help advance
novel cardiovascular stem cell therapies on Earth3,12. Additionally, micro-
gravity in space activated yes-associated protein (YAP1), a key component
of the Hippo signaling pathway which regulates cell proliferation and car-
diac development48–51 in adult CPCs which have potential beneﬁt for car-
diovascular repair. The study suggests that inducing adult CPCs to
overexpress YAP1 can enable these progenitors to have regeneration
potentialsimilartothatof neonatalCPCs12.Thisisparticularlysigniﬁcantin
the ﬁeld of cardiac regeneration, given that the human heart has limited
regeneration capabilities.
Neural stem cells
Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human iPSCs were cultured on the
ISS and then returned to Earth. Analysis of these cells showed that they
preserved their stemness and were able to proliferate in space while also
remaining as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended in the same culture med-
ium in space. These in-space NSCs were able to maintain their ability to
become young neurons when cultured in neuronal speciﬁcation media
(NSM) upon return, indicating that exposure to microgravity in space did
not change their potential to choose the neuronal fate. Additionally,
neuroblasts proliferated for over a week when placed in NSM before
deciding to mature13.
These ﬁndings show that microgravity is an excellent tool to increase
neural cell numbers without the need to perform genetic manipulations of
long-term treatments with mitogens. This is relevant to advancing human
health on Earth since neurodegenerative diseases frequently result from loss
of a speciﬁc cell population and perhaps in-space grown NSCs can be a
potential solution. Investigating the effects of microgravity in space on the
regulation of NSCs and their commitment to a speciﬁc lineage can offer
beneﬁts to patients on Earth for cell replacement therapies and recovery of
CNS structure and function. This can be done by using donor cells from the
patients themselves to address neurodegenerative and development
disorders including cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis, and then developing
personalized treatments for them.
In addition to this, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) based transcriptomic
proﬁling revealed that NSCs maintained greater stemness ability during
spaceﬂight via elevation of markers for stemness including Sox2, Pax6, and
Notch1 despite reduction in growth rate. Also, the increased expression of
matureneuronmarkerMap2anddecreaseinastrocytemarkerGfapandthe
oligodendrocyte markers Gal and Olig2 demonstrated NSCs’ tendency to
differentiate into neurons in space. These ﬁndings suggest that culture in
outer space combined with biomaterial-based 3D culture system may
improve the neural differentiation abilities of NSCs in vitro and contribute
to tissue engineering. Further understanding of the mechanisms which
occur in NSCs during spaceﬂight could improve our knowledge and unveil
potential beneﬁts for NSC-based regenerative medicine52. Also, boundary
cap neural crest stem cells exposed to real microgravity in space showed
improved viability and increased survival and proliferation compared to
cells exposed to simulated gravity on Earth, with signiﬁcantly different gene
expression patterns for proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation between
thespaceandsimulatedmicrogravitygroups53.Conﬂictingevidencepersists
sincein-spaceNSCsexperienceareductioningrowthrateinspace52butalso

of ﬂight duration54,55.
Furthermore, a recent study which assessed the behavior of in-space
NSCs that readapted to Earth’s gravity found that although most of these
cells survived spaceﬂight and self-renewed, some showed enhanced stress
responses and autophagy-like behavior via secretome and proteomics
analysis56 and increased energy production demands57. Also, NSCs derived
fromhiPSCswhichremainedonboardtheISSfor39.6daysbeforereturning
to Earth showed an increased number of abnormal cell division events
between one- and two-weeks post-space ﬂight58. Nonetheless, the different
cell types that form the central nervous system, either individually or col-
lectively, may respond to microgravity in different ways56. Also, the culture
hardware used in space may play a role in how cells respond.
Further beneﬁts
In addition to using in-space stem cells for clinical use on Earth, there are
many other beneﬁts that result from this scientiﬁc endeavor. Stem cells in
space can be used as tools for scientists in disease modelling to test new
therapeutics whenstudying a speciﬁc disease.Performing such experiments
expands the use of spaceas a unique and natural environment inbiomedical
research to study biological phenomena to manipulate cell processes. Also,
advancing in-space expansion of stem cells opens the door to exploring

microgravity, besides stem cells. Such research also encourages the study of
organoids in space which may hold promising regenerative medicine and
translational stem cell applications59.
Additionally, the potential privatization and/or commercialization of
in-space stem cells allows the acceleration of research and technology
development in low Earth orbit (LEO), further expanding the medical
commerce in space and valuable biomanufacturing enterprises. The
advancements currently taking place in space infrastructure technologies
are promising in reducing costs and increasing frequency to access space7.
Growing stem cells in space pushes the boundaries of creativity and inno-
vation in seeking ways to help patients and advancing medical practice
forward, that may not be replicated in a terrestrial setting. Using the LEO
environment to expand stem cells and other products for scientiﬁc research
and clinical use could provide insights that have signiﬁcant impacts to the
greater scientiﬁc community and public.
Furthermore, understanding how stem cells behave in space and their
subsequent expansion helps the development of suitable countermeasures
to protect astronauts from problems encountered during long-duration
spaceﬂight missions. It beneﬁts current and future space travelers as more
knowledge is known about the effects of microgravity on the behavior of
stem cells. An interdisciplinary approach including experts from a range of
disciplines is requiredto achieve the full beneﬁtsof utilizing space toexpand
stem cells and stem cell-derived tissues for the beneﬁt of mankind.
Current limitations and gaps
Despite the potential beneﬁts to using stem cells grown in space for clinical
use, there remain limitations and gaps in our knowledge, scientiﬁc practices,
and funding capabilities to make this a reality for patients. Studying stem
cells in space and investigating their safety and feasibility for use in cellular
therapies is still in its infancy. A full understanding of the effects of
microgravity on stem cell growth and differentiation is needed. It is yetto be
established whether microgravity induces expansion (quantity) or potency/
stemness (quality) or both and whether the effect is universal to all types of
stem cells60. There is conﬂicting evidence in the literature about the regen-
erative potential of various types of stem cells, as beneﬁts associated with
culturing stem cells in microgravity are reported for mesenchymal stem
cells6,8,24–26 hematopoietic stem cells9, cardiomyocytes derived from
hiPSCs10,11,61, cardiovascular progenitor cells3,12 and neural stem cells13,52–55
and disadvantages for mesenchymal stem cells6,26–30, hematopoietic stem
cells36–39 and neural stem cells52,56–58. Additionally, it has been reported that
microgravity reduces regenerative potential of other stem cells including
embryonic stem cells32. While simulated microgravity is seen to inhibit
osteogenesis of MSCs31,62, it is also seen to increase adipogenesis62. There is
limited understanding of how microgravity in space affects stem cell dif-
ferentiation since on Earth this is a major barrier to expanding large
quantities of stem cells. Also, optimal cell culture media for the in vitro
expansion of stem cells while maintaining stemness and limiting differ-
entiation is not well-established60. Further research is required to under-
standthestemcell-speciﬁcchangeswhichoccurinspacetodifferenttypesof
stem cells, how to leverage and target those beneﬁts while minimizing the
disadvantages, and potential implications for regenerative therapeutics.
Additionally, different stem cell samples from different donors and
sources need to be tested. The variability which exists in stem cell potency
between different cell lines and the inabilityto maintain potency and genetic
integrity with cell proliferation is still a challenge7. Also, it is important to
note that on Earth and especially with ageing, stem cell exhaustion occurs.
Thisisknownasthedecreaseinstemcellabundanceandactivitywherethey
stop dividing after a couple of population doublings63. Whether stem cell
exhaustion happens in space needs to be studied, especially since the
spaceﬂight microgravity environment induces an accelerated ageing phe-
notype in many in vivo physiological systems64–66.
Furthermore, microgravity is not the only major environmental
change that stem cells are exposed to in space. Ionizing radiation (IR) in
space affects stem cells, particularly when they are dividing, and this can
transform cells to be malignant. Research has shown that stem cells exposed
to simulated cosmic galactic cosmic ray (GCR) radiation or solar energetic
particles (SEP) experience dramatic changes in their differentiation poten-
tial and report increased apoptosis, delayed DNA repair, DNA damage and
mutations which may lead to leukemic transformation within the hema-
topoietic system67–69. Although IR exposure is associated with an increase in
cancer risk, particularly leukemias, the exact mechanisms underlying IR-
induced malignancy remain poorly understood70–72. The effects of IR on
tissuesarecomplexandthecausationofoncogenicmutationsisnottheonly
mechanism to explain the relationship between IR and cancers, among
other factors73. Evidence of the overall carcinogenic susceptibility of stem
cells in space, whether inﬂuenced by cosmic radiation, microgravity, or
otherstressorsascontributingfactors,islimited,andneedstobeunderstood
to assess the feasibility of growing stem cells in space for use on Earth.
The costs associated with this sort of research and large-scale pro-
duction of in-space stem cells for patient use is high and limited by the
challenges of launching and performing experiments in space. There is
also a need for validation of in-space products for terrestrial applications.
Nonetheless, recent scientiﬁc research efforts and global forums like the
2020 Biomanufacturing in Space symposium have outlined the founda-
tions required to leverage microgravity in LEO to advance stem cell
therapeutics and biomanufacturing for regenerative medicine purposes.
An extensive roadmap to overcoming barriers is required where ﬁnancial
investments are coupled with scientiﬁc research and innovation7. Also,
stem cells grown in space for research and subsequent therapies must
follow the best practices and guidelines currently in place. This includes
abiding by the International Stem Cell Initiative (ICSI) and the Interna-
tional Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) standard74. Nevertheless,
major developments and discoveries addressing stem cells in space have
occurred in the past decade alone which can propel this unique branch of
regenerative medicine further.
Returning to Earth: requirements and considerations
for in-space stem cell use in patients
While stem cell research in space provides valuable insights into effects of
the spaceﬂight environment on their behavior, including both beneﬁts and
existing challenges, their therapeutic translation requires establishing
standard safety and functionality protocols and suitable regulatory
approvals. The studies in this review show that the spaceﬂight environment
doesnotharmthedifferenttypesofstemcellsinvestigatedandmayenhance
their quantity and/or quality. However, it is important to also investigate
whether stem cells cultured in space can do their job effectively when back
on Earth. It is not enough that stem cells can grow in space and retain their
stem cell characteristics. Further studies must investigate the safety, func-
tionality, and feasibility of growing stem cells in space for patient use and
make a conclusion about whether the advantages in space outweigh the
challenges and costs. Also, they must address whether there is a signiﬁcant
beneﬁt and novelty in choosing to expand stem cells in space than on Earth
particularly for clinical use.
Stemcells grown in space are different to those grown on Earth, and so,
speciﬁc protocols and safety checkpoints unique to them must be created
and followed. Analyses regarding their suitability to be used in cell therapy
must be established while passing the required quality control procedures
and regulatory guidelines, including further research and clinical trials
(Table 2). Also, since different types of stem cells react differently in space, a
comprehensive framework identifying the stem cell-speciﬁc changes which
happen are crucial moving forward.
Expanding stem cells for regenerative medicine applications is a novel
therapeutic strategy for many conditions. In this paper, we discussed the
innovative approaches to growing stem cells in space for potential use on
Earth along with the conﬂicting data which exists today. The evidence
available suggests that microgravity culture conditions may have substantial
potential as a cell culture environment for expanding cells with improved
therapeutic effects while the full underlying treatment mechanisms remain
unclear. Incorporating microgravity into projects of a translational nature
may lead to beneﬁts towards patients on Earth to address important

developmental and aging disorders, injuries, and diseases across different
organ systems. This may bring the scientiﬁc community closer to creating
promising cellular therapies for debilitating conditions, as well as unco-
vering pathways and mechanisms about stem cells in a unique environment
like space. These results not only give important information fundamental
to stem cell biology but enable the further development of LEO-based stem
cell research platforms. Therefore, a broader perspective about stem cell
applications is possible in space as research continues to explore the use of
space for regenerative medicine.
