Abstract
Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space
missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and
continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of
biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic
cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight
on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during
two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized.
Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity
controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been
observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight
were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven
motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent
the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of
understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.

Introduction
Manned space missions conducted over the past 50 years have
expanded our knowledge of the universe, and have led to the
identification of a range of challenges that must be addressed as we
move towards the next phase of human space exploration. A key
concern is how microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight
environment affect bacterial growth, physiology and virulence.
Several in-flight studies have reported that the microgravity
environment encountered during spaceflight can alter bacterial
growth and physiology, including increased final cell density,
antibiotic resistance, and virulence (reviewed by Horneck et al.
[1]). However, the effects of spaceflight on microbial community
behaviors, such as biofilm formation, have not been systematically
addressed. Furthermore, spaceflight has been shown to have
harmful effects on astronauts including decreased immune system
function [2]. Recent in-flight studies using Drosophila and mouse
models have also shown that spaceflight can suppress the innate
immune system [3,4]. The combined microgravitational effects of
decreased immune function in space travelers and increased
resistance and virulence in bacteria may be detrimental to the
health of the crew during long-term space exploration.
To date, spaceflight studies on bacterial behavior have been
conducted using suspension cultures. However, such cultures do
not typically represent real-world situations because the majority
of
bacteria
in
nature
exist
in
surface-associated
microbial
communities known as biofilms. Bacteria in biofilms often exhibit
increased resistance to environmental stress, antibiotics, and host
defense systems [5]. Thus, many problems caused by biofilms such
as biofouling, corrosion, and infectious diseases are difficult to
control using conventional antimicrobial treatments [5,6]. Indeed,
abundant biofilms were found in the Russian Mir space station
and were responsible for increased corrosion and a blocked water
purification system [7]. Ground-based studies have indicated that
corrosion caused by biofilms can be detrimental to materials that
were used on the International Space Station and other spacecrafts
[8]. An experiment using simulated microgravity showed that
Escherichia coli grown in simulated microgravity form thicker
biofilms and exhibit increased resistance to stress compared to
normal gravity controls [9]. In experiments conducted aboard
STS-95, McLean et al. observed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is able

to form biofilms during spaceflight [10]. However, their experi-
mental system did not enable quantitative comparisons of biofilms
formed during spaceflight and normal gravity. More recently,
Wilson et al. observed that Salmonella cultured during spaceflight
exhibited increases in cellular aggregation and clumping, processes
that are associated with biofilm formation [11]. Despite such
evidence that biofilm formation may be altered in a low gravity
environment, systematic studies comparing biofilm formation
during spaceflight and normal gravity have not been reported.
To examine the role of microgravity on microbial biofilm
formation, we conducted two sets of experiments aboard the Space
Shuttle Atlantis (STS-132 and STS-135) where we examined the
growth of P. aeruginosa PA14, an opportunistic human pathogen
and a model organism for biofilm studies. Previous studies have
examined how planktonic P. aeruginosa cells respond to simulated
microgravity and the spaceflight environment [12–16]. Crabbe´
et al., identified 167 genes and 28 proteins that were differentially
regulated during spaceflight, and showed that the global regulator
Hfq plays a key role in how P. aeruginosa responds to microgravity
[16]. To study P. aeruginosa biofilm formation during spaceflight,
we used specialized hardware designed for growing cells during
spaceflight, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA; Figure
S1). FPAs have been used in several recent studies of bacterial
growth and physiology during spaceflight [11,16,17]. Briefly, an
FPA is a glass barrel that can be divided into compartments by
rubber stoppers. During spaceflight, a plunging motion can be
used to mix the components loaded into the different compart-
ments via a bevel on the side of the glass barrel. For our
experiments, a mixed cellulose ester membrane disc was used as
a biofilm substrate. A modified artificial urine media (mAUM,
Table S1) was loaded into the first compartment containing the
membrane. mAUM was used because it provides a physiologically
relevant environment for the study of biofilms formed both inside
and outside the human body [18]. The second compartment was
filled with inoculum stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For
microscopy samples only, a third compartment was filled with
a paraformaldehyde solution. As illustrated in the timeline shown
in Figure S2, biofilms were formed under static conditions in FPAs
at 37uC for 72 h. Subsequently, the temperature was decreased to
8uC to minimize further growth, and fixative was added to the
microscopy samples. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h
after landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were
conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight
samples.
Here, we report the first evidence that spaceflight affects biofilm
formation by P. aeruginosa, with increased numbers of viable cells,
increased biomass, and increased thickness observed in spaceflight
biofilms compared to normal gravity controls. Biofilms formed by
P. aeruginosa during spaceflight also exhibited a column-and-
canopy-shaped architecture that has not been observed previously.
We show that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in formation
of this novel architecture, and relate the mechanism to structured
biofilm formation on Earth.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Culture Media
Strains used in this study are shown in Table S2. Overnight
shaking cultures of all strains were cultured at 37uC in nutrient
broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed
and
resuspended
in
PBS
to
a
final
concentration
of
,66106 CFU/mL. Modified artificial urine media (mAUM)
was used as the growth media (Table S1) [18]. To ensure
reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid
solution (506; Sigma, MO, cat #: R7131,) and L-glutamine
solution (200 mM; Sigma, MO, cat #: G7513) were substituted
for peptone and yeast extract. The concentration of calcium
chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to
minimize precipitation during storage at 8uC. Sodium nitrate,
6 mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and
enable cell growth when the conditions in the FPAs become
anaerobic. Higher concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided
to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the
accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. Phosphate
concentration was lowered to 5 mM to decrease phosphate
availability. mAUM includes 2 mM citric acid and 5 mM
phosphate. To test the effects of phosphate availability on biofilms,
the phosphate concentration was increased to 50 mM (mAUM-
high Pi). To test the effects of carbon source, 2 mM citric acid was
substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). The pH of all media was
adjusted to 7.0.
Spaceflight and Ground Control Cultures
Spaceflight and
ground control cultures were grown in
specialized hardware, known as a fluid processing apparatus
(FPA), designed by Bioserve Space Technologies (University of
Colorado). FPAs consist of a glass barrel, rubber stoppers, and
a solid or gas exchange (GE) insert (Figure S1). Glass barrels and
rubber stoppers were lubricated by coating with Sigmacote
(Sigma, MO) and autoclaved before use. First, a 13 mm diameter
Millipore mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (catalog #:
GSWP01300) was attached to a solid or GE insert with 3 M
autoclavable double-sided tape. Second, a solid or GE insert was
inserted to the edge of the bevel in the glass barrel. Next, 2.5 mL
of media and 0.5 mL of inoculum were added to the FPA and
separated by a rubber stopper. A third compartment, for
microscopy samples only, was filled with 2.4 mL of 9% para-
formaldehyde. Three biological replicates were prepared for each
experimental condition.
To facilitate group activation during spaceflight, eight FPAs
were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP) that enables
the simultaneous plunging of rubber stoppers to mix contents of
the compartments in all eight FPAs. GAPs were stored in
a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) that
accommodates
16
GAPs
and
enables
temperature
control.
Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline (Figure
S2). Three or five days before shuttle launch, all FPAs and GAPs
were loaded. Samples were stored at 8uC. Four or five days before
shuttle landing, the media and inoculum were combined and
subsequently incubated at 37uC for 72 h. One or two days before
shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8uC and the
microscopy samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde. An
astronaut aboard the shuttle manually changed the incubator
temperature and conducted the activation and termination mixing
steps. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after shuttle
landing and were processed immediately. Ground controls were
conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight
samples.
Viable Cell Counting
Mixed cellulose ester membranes were detached from the insert
and washed gently three-times with PBS to remove planktonic cells
and loosely associated cells. The membrane was placed in 1 mL
PBS and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8 min.
The sonicated samples were serially diluted with PBS in 96-well
plate. The diluted samples were spot-plated on NB agar and
incubated at 37uC for 18 h.

Preparation of Biofilm Samples and Microscopic
Observation
Mixed cellulose ester membranes were detached and washed as
described for viable cell counting. Biofilms were stained with
a solution containing 1 mg/mL propidium iodide, 1% Triton X-
100 in PBS. The staining procedure was adapted from Castaneda
et al. [19], where the propidium iodide dye was substituted for
fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC).
The use of a 1 mg/mL
propidium iodide solution to stain fixed P. aeruginosa biofilms has
been described previously [20]. Biofilm images were obtained
using a Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) confocal laser
scanning microscope equipped with detectors and filter sets for
propidium iodide (excitation, 543 nm: emission, 565 nm). Images
were obtained using a 406/1.3 oil objective. Five image stacks
(center and 1 mm right, left, up, and down from center) were
obtained from each membrane. Simulated three-dimensional
images and sections were generated using IMARIS 7.1 software
(Bitplane AG, Switzerland). Analysis of confocal images was
performed using COMSTAT software [21]. Void fraction was
calculated using the following equation:

Results
Spaceflight Increases Biofilm Formation
To assess the effects of spaceflight on biofilm formation, we
cultured P. aeruginosa biofilms and quantitatively compared biofilm
formation between spaceflight and normal gravity. The number of
viable cells within the biofilms was determined by plate counting.
In addition, the biomass (mm3 biofilm/mm2 membrane) and mean
thickness (mm) of the biofilms were determined from images
obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with
the aid of COMSTAT software [21]. The number of viable cells in
P. aeruginosa biofilms formed in mAUM during spaceflight
increased three-fold compared to those formed in normal gravity
(p,0.01) (Figure 1A). Results from quantitative image analysis also
indicated that spaceflight promotes biofilm production by P.
aeruginosa, where both biomass (p,0.05) and mean thickness
(p,0.01) increased significantly (Figures 1B and 1C).
We tested the role of phosphate availability and carbon source
on biofilm formation during spaceflight because previous reports
have shown that spaceflight-dependent responses in planktonic
cultures of Salmonella were modulated by nutrient availability [22].
When the concentration of phosphate in mAUM was increased
from 5 mM to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi), biofilms cultured during
spaceflight showed a 5-fold increase in viable cells (p,0.01),
increased biomass volume (p,0.01), and increased mean thickness
(p,0.01) (Figures 1A–C and Table S4). To assess whether the
effect of spaceflight on biofilm formation is dependent on carbon
source, we substituted 2 mM citric acid in mAUM with 2 mM
glucose (mAUMg). As with mAUM, P. aeruginosa biofilms cultured
in mAUMg and mAUMg-high Pi during spaceflight exhibited a 6-
to 12-fold increase in viable cell counts (p,0.01), along with
corresponding increases in biomass (p,0.01) and mean thickness
(p,0.01), compared to normal gravity controls (Figure 1, Tables 1
and S4). Overall, we have observed that spaceflight induced an
increase in the number of viable cells, biomass, and mean
thickness of biofilms regardless of phosphate concentration or
carbon source. The experiments with mAUM and mAUM-high Pi
were conducted both on STS-132 and aboard STS-135. The
results from STS-135 (Figure 1) were consistent with those from
STS-132 (Figure S3). Planktonic growth was also observed to
increase
during
spaceflight
only
under
the
low
phosphate
conditions found in mAUM and mAUMg (manuscript in
preparation). However, no differences between spaceflight and
normal gravity planktonic cell growth were observed when the
concentration of phosphate in the media was increased to 50 mM,
indicating that the observed increases in biofilm biomass are not
solely due to increases in bacterial growth.
Spaceflight Alters Biofilm Architecture
On Earth, P. aeruginosa forms mushroom-shaped, structured
biofilms under hydrodynamic conditions, such as those found in
flow-cell systems, in media containing glucose as a carbon source
and flat biofilms in media with citrate [23–25]. Under static
conditions, structured biofilms are generally not observed because
of limited nutrient availability and aeration [5,26]. To assess
whether spaceflight causes any structural differences in P. aeruginosa
biofilms, we compared CLSM images obtained from samples
grown in spaceflight and normal gravity. The increased thickness
of the biofilms formed in mAUMg during spaceflight is readily
apparent from side view images (Figure 2A). Moreover, P.
aeruginosa biofilms grown during spaceflight exhibited a structure

and spaceflight (grey bars) conditions in mAUM or mAUMg containing 5 or 50 mM phosphate. (A) The number of surface-associated viable cells per

consisting of columns overlaid with a canopy, while biofilms
cultured in normal gravity showed flat structures. As shown in
Figure 2B, the column-and-canopy structure can be seen clearly
when slices of the biofilm, approximately 5.8 mm thick, were
prepared from partial z stacks. The slice closest to the substratum
clearly shows cell aggregates that have formed column-like
structures with significant unoccupied space. Farther away from
the membrane, biofilms grown in spaceflight showed dense, mat-
like structures that form a canopy over the columns. In contrast,
the normal gravity samples showed uniformly dense structures.
Comparisons of the z stack slices showed that P. aeruginosa grown
during spaceflight formed column-and-canopy structured biofilms
in mAUM (Figure S4), as well as mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-
high Pi (Table S4). To the best of our knowledge, such structures
have not been reported previously. Further, the presence of three-
dimensionally structured, as opposed to flat, biofilms was especially
surprising due to the static environment in our biofilm culture
system.
Quantitative image analysis comparing the amount of un-
occupied space within the biofilm structure also indicated
a significant structural difference between biofilms formed in
normal gravity and those formed during spaceflight. Specifically,
we compared the void fraction of biofilms using the biomass and
mean thickness values obtained from CLSM image analysis.
Biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a 1.8-fold increase in
void fraction compared to normal gravity controls (Tables 1 and
S3). This observation is consistent with the large volume of empty
space observed ‘‘underneath’’ the biofilm canopies formed under
microgravity.
Motility Affects Spaceflight Biofilm Formation
Flagella-driven motility and type IV pili-driven motility have
been shown to affect P. aeruginosa biofilm development [25,27].
Furthermore, flagella-driven motility plays a key role in the
development of structured biofilms under hydrodynamic condi-
tions [28]. To examine whether motility plays a role in the
formation of the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms during
spaceflight we compared CLSM images obtained with wild-type
P. aeruginosa with those formed by mutants deficient in flagella-
driven motility, DmotABCD [29], and type IV pili-driven motility,
DpilB [27]. As shown in Figure 2, the structure of DmotABCD
biofilms cultured during spaceflight showed uniformly dense
biofilms with no apparent structural difference from those cultured
in normal gravity (Figures 2 and S4). In contrast, DpilB behaved
similarly to wild type, where biofilms formed during spaceflight
showed column-and-canopy structures and those formed in
normal gravity showed dense, uniform biofilms (Figure 2). These
findings indicate that, like the mushroom-shaped structured
biofilms formed on Earth, flagella-driven motility plays a key role
in formation of column-and-canopy structured biofilms.
We also assessed the role of motility on biofilm production. Like
wild-type P. aeruginosa, DmotABCD grown during spaceflight
showed an 8-fold increase in number of viable cells in biofilms
compared to those grown in normal gravity regardless of carbon
source (Tables 1 and S3). From COMSTAT image analysis,
however, no significant difference in biomass or mean thickness
was observed in DmotABCD biofilms cultured in mAUM or
mAUMg between spaceflight and normal gravity (Tables 1 and
S3). The discrepancy between viable cell counting and COM-
STAT analysis in DmotABCD biofilms indicates a difference in
relative numbers of viable cells per volume of biomass, where
spaceflight may increase either the amount of cells per volume of
extracellular matrix or the viability of cells within the matrix. Like
wild-type P. aeruginosa, DpilB biofilms grown during spaceflight
showed increased viable cell numbers in biofilms (p,0.01),
biomass (p,0.05), and mean thickness (p,0.01) compared to
normal gravity controls (Table 1).
Effects of Oxygen Availability on Biofilm Formation
To assess the effect of oxygen availability on biofilm formation
during spaceflight, we substituted the solid inserts used in the
experiments described above with gas exchange (GE) inserts that
allow the movement of gases via a gas permeable membrane
(Figure S1). A significant increase in biofilm formation was
observed with GE inserts compared to solid inserts under both
normal gravity and microgravity conditions (Figure 3 and Table 1).
Further, no differences between biofilms grown under normal and
microgravity conditions were observed with the GE inserts for
both wild type and DmotABCD. The structures of biofilms grown
with GE inserts were flat and dense (Figure 3 and Table 1), similar
to those observed under static conditions on Earth [26]. We also
observed that the difference between the amount of planktonic
biomass formed in normal gravity and spaceflight was minimized
with the GE inserts (manuscript in preparation).

Discussion
We have shown that P. aeruginosa forms column-and-canopy-
shaped biofilms during spaceflight and that flagella-driven motility
plays a key role in the formation of this unique structure. Figure 4
summarizes how biofilms formed under the spaceflight culture
conditions compare with those formed under two common
laboratory culture conditions, static and hydrodynamic [26,30].
Under hydrodynamic conditions, P. aeruginosa can form mush-
room-shaped structured biofilms, while flat biofilms are generally
observed under static conditions [23]. Under static conditions
during spaceflight, however, biofilms with column-and-canopy
structures were observed. Flagella-driven motility plays a key role
the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms formed
during spaceflight and the mushroom-shaped biofilms formed in
hydrodynamic conditions on Earth. However, the formation of
mushroom-shaped biofilms is dependent on a carbon source [31],
while we have observed that the formation of column-and-canopy-
shaped biofilms is independent of carbon source (Figures 2 and
S4).
Both
the column-and-canopy-shaped
biofilms
and
the
mushroom-shaped biofilms have two-layered structures, and the
mushroom ‘‘stalks" and columns are likely formed using the same
mechanism, further evidenced by the fact that flagella-driven
motility is required for both. While the top layer of the mushroom-
shaped biofilms is an isolated cap structure, the top layer of the
column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is a flat mat-like structure.
The canopy is likely an extension and connection of the isolated
‘‘caps’’ observed in mushroom-shaped structures (Figure 4). While
still an active area of research, the size of mushroom ‘‘cap’’ has
been observed to be limited under hydrodynamic conditions in
normal gravity by a combination of flow [32], gravity or natural
dispersal
mechanisms
[5].
In
contrast,
the
fluid
dynamics
surrounding cells in microgravity are extremely quiescent because
of diminished gravity (,1026 g) [33,34]. Under microgravity
conditions, the virtual absence of flow and gravity may promote
the unlimited expansion of the mushroom ‘‘caps’’ resulting in the
formation of the intact canopy on top of the relatively widely
spaced columns. The formation of flat biofilms with the GE inserts
may be due an increase in biofilm growth rate, either by
preventing the formation of the stratified structure or expanding
into the space available under the canopy. However, it is possible
that increased oxygen availability inhibits the formation of the
column-and-canopy structure.
We speculate that the increases in biofilm formation observed
with the GE inserts are primarily due to increased oxygen
availability. With the solid inserts, the conditions in the FPA are
most likely microaerophilic to anaerobic as the cells consume the
oxygen available in the liquid and air bubble present in the closed
system. While the GE inserts were designed to provide an aerobic
environment in the FPAs, results from P. aeruginosa gene expression
studies have indicated that growth is likely oxygen limited even
with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within
the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight
conditions [16]. In the present study, the direct attachment of the
biofilm substrate to the GE inserts maximized the oxygen available
for surface-associated cells and minimized the differences in
oxygen availability between spaceflight and normal gravity
conditions. Overall, in the samples grown with the solid inserts,
oxygen is likely a limiting substrate for growth. When the GE
inserts were used to increase the oxygen availability, an increase in
biofilm was observed and the difference between normal gravity
and microgravity diminished. Therefore, the advantage conferred
by microgravity is dependent upon resource availability, where
changes in mixing, diffusion, sedimentation and other environ-
mental factors play a more significant role under such limiting
conditions. This observation is similar to results from Wilson et al.,
who showed that an increase in nutrient availability minimized the
differences in virulence observed with Salmonella between normal
and microgravity [22]. We anticipate that these data will lead to
the development of mathematical models describing the physico-
chemical environment experienced by the cells under microgravity
and normal gravity conditions and insights into the nature of the
differences that cause the observed changes in growth and
dependence on nutrient availability.
We have demonstrated that spaceflight can trigger changes in P.
aeruginosa biofilm growth and architecture. To the best of our
knowledge, these findings are the first evidence that spaceflight
influences community-level behaviors of bacteria. Our findings
indicate that altered biofilm formation during spaceflight may
have detrimental impacts on long-term spaceflight missions, where

increases in biofouling and microbially-induced corrosion could
have profound impacts on mission success. Furthermore, it will be
important to explore the effects of such changes on human health
through pathogenic and beneficial interactions between humans
and microbes during spaceflight.
While further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms
involved in the formation of the unique biofilm architecture
observed during spaceflight, this work provides a set of data
exploring conditions and parameters that are not possible on
Earth. Thus, furthering our understanding of how environmental
parameters alter biofilm formation by this key opportunistic
pathogen. The unique morphology of the P. aeruginosa biofilms
formed in microgravity suggests that nature is capable of adapting
to non-terrestrial environments in ways that deserve further
studies, including those exploring long-term growth and adapta-
tion to a low gravity environment.

setup.
A
mixed
cellulose
membrane was attached with two-sided tape to either a solid
insert or a gas exchange insert. 2.5 mL of media was loaded into
the first compartment (blue). 0.5 mL of inoculum was loaded into
the second compartment (yellow). For microscopy samples only,
2.4 mL of a 9% (w/v) solution of paraformaldehyde in PBS was
loaded into the compartment (red). (B) Group activation pack
(GAP). A representative GAP loaded with samples for viable cell
counting. Mixing of the contents is achieved by use of a crank
handle attached to the top of the GAP, enabling uniform plunging
of each FPA. (C) Commercial generic bioprocessing apparatus
(CGBA). The CGBA functions as an incubator and holds 16
GAPs. The CGBA functions as an incubator and holds 16 GAPs.
The CGBA, containing 16 GAPs, was loaded directly into
a middeck locker aboard the space shuttle. Temperature changes
were made manually by an astronaut during spaceflight.
