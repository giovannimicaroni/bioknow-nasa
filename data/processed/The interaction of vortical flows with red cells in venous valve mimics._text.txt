ABSTRACT
The motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of
red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves,
aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing micro-
fluidic devices. Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in
venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an
in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using
micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results
show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a
threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the
entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational
characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve
mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.

INTRODUCTION
Red blood cells (RBCs) or erythrocytes are the most abundant
cells in blood with 5 × 109 cells/ml accounting for 40%–50% (known
as hematocrit or HCT) by volume in a healthy individual. RBCs are
highly deformable, and the unique deformability characteristics of
a RBC are key in the fluid and mass transport processes in the
vasculature.1 Although RBCs have mostly been appreciated in the
context of tissue oxygenation, ischemia, and vaso-occlusion, several
epidemiological studies have detected varying associations between
hematocrit levels and thrombosis.2–5 The RBC composition in the
blood clots depends on local flow rates—venous thrombi, which are
typically associated with low flow conditions or blood stasis, are
richer in red cells than arterial thrombi, which are typically associ-
ated with high flow conditions.6 In addition, flow-induced hemolysis
and device-related thrombosis are causal to complications associated
with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and extracorporeal
membrane oxygenators (ECMOs).7 Therefore, it is important to
understand how blood flow dictates local RBC distribution.
Numerous and excellent experimental and computational
studies have investigated the role of RBC concentration, deform-
ability, shape, and hydrodynamic interactions, mostly in straight,
stenosed, or bifurcating channels in the context of hemostasis or
thrombosis.8–13 However, relatively little effort has been expended
in understanding blood flows inside a cavity or a sudden expansion,
which is of relevance to flows in artificial devices (LVADs and
ECMOs) and physiological systems (aortic aneurysms and venous
valves). Of interest, a growing body of evidence points to the
important contribution of RBCs in the pathophysiology of venous
thrombosis.14,15 Venous thrombosis (VT) originates in the sinuses
of venous valves, which are layered flaps in peripheral veins that
prevent the backflow of blood.16 The venous valve sinuses are
regions of low flow, and flow stasis in the valve sinus is long con-
sidered to be a major factor triggering venous thrombosis.17–19 The
presence of a large cavity immediately distal to sudden expansion
gives rise to unique flow patterns in the venous valve sinuses as
observed in ex vivo fixed valves,20 in vivo ultrasound studies,21 and

in vitro biomimetic valves.22,23 Experimental flow visualization
studies show that these unique flow patterns due to sudden expan-
sion result in differential RBC distribution in the distal pockets vs
the center of the channel.24,25 However, there is insufficient
information how these flow patterns determine RBC transport and
local hematocrit distribution in the venous valve sinuses. This
information on the interaction of recirculating flows with red cells
can also be valuable for the growing interest in predicting throm-
botic risks from patient-specific flow patterns determined by the
vessel geometry.
In this work, we seek to determine experimentally the effect of
venous valve hydrodynamics on local RBC distribution. Using
microfluidics, micro-particle image velocimetry (μPIV), computa-
tional fluid dynamics (CFD), and microscopy, we resolve the
impact of local velocity fields and shear rates on RBC distributions
in venous valve mimics. We use a dilute suspension of RBCs so
that the individual cells could be discriminated without overcrowd-
ing, minimizing the confinement effects in the scale-down micro-
fluidic model, and the role of fluid–cell interactions in RBC
distribution may be studied without the confounding effects of
cell–cell interactions that are prominent at physiological hematocrit
levels.26 From the images of RBC distribution at various flow rates,
we demonstrate that the local RBC concentrations in the valve
sinuses are dramatically different from bulk flow due to vortical
flows in the sudden expansion. We also determine the minimum
shear rates necessary to drive the RBCs into the vortex and show
that entrapment leads to a long residence time.
METHODS
The experimental system consisted of an infusion pump for
positive pressure driven flow through the microfluidic chip, which
was mounted on a microscope objective for the visualization of
both RBC distribution and μPIV (Fig. 1). The dimensions of the
microfluidic channels are designed to mimic venous valves that are
partially closed, leading to sudden expansion, and the channel
Reynolds number (Re) was matched with what has been reported
previously in in vivo flows.20,27
Microfluidic device
A microfluidic device was designed to mimic venous valves
using CAD software (AutoCAD, San Rafael, CA).50 To simulate the
sudden expansion in the valves, the main channel suddenly
expands from a narrow constriction of 30 to 300 μm. The walls of

bead suspension was perfused through
the device at constant pressure using a
syringe pump and analyzed either by
microscopy or by μPIV, respectively.
When acquiring bright field images for
RBC distribution measurements, the

the valve pockets are angled at 135° relative to the direction of flow.
The design was printed on a bright field mask, and using this
mask, a silicon wafer was fabricated by soft lithography. A wafer
was coated with SU-8 2035 to create a mold with a height of
35 μm. The mold was salinized with 95%–100% trichlorosilane
(Gelest, Morrisville, PA) to preserve the design and prevent adhe-
sion to the elastomer. The silicone base (Dow Corning, Midland,
MI) was mixed with the curing agent at a ratio of 10:1 by weight to
create polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Dow Corning, Midland, MI).
The solution was poured onto the wafer and cured for 2.25 h at 90 °C
(Precision Oven, Model 658, Thermo Scientific). The required
design was cut and the inlet and outlet holes were punched using a
1 -mm biopsy punch (Miltex, York, PA). The PDMS designs were
sonicated in a bath sonicator (Model 75HT, LabX) for 10 min at
room temperature in 35% ethanol solution to remove any debris.
They were then rinsed in DI water and left to dry for 1 h at 90 °C.
After cooling, PDMS and the microscope glass slide (Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) were activated by exposure to oxygen
plasma (Basic Plasma Cleaner, Model PDC-32G, Harrick Plasma).
These surfaces were immediately pushed together firmly to create an
airtight seal. The chips were left to cure for 2 h at 90 °C to make the
binding irreversible. The chips were prepared 24 h before the experi-
ment to provide enough time for hydrophilic decay of PDMS to
baseline levels.
Cell preparation
Venous blood was freshly drawn from healthy volunteers after
signing an informed consent and obtaining written ethics approval
in accordance with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol
(IRB F16134, Office of Research, SJSU). The red blood cells (RBCs)
were separated from whole blood by spinning at 250 RCF with 7
acceleration and no breaks for 25 min at 22 °C (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany). The top plasma layer and the middle buffy
coat were discarded. A dilute RBC suspension at a desired hemato-
crit concentration was prepared by diluting the appropriate volume
of RBCs in a modified PBS buffer at physiological pH. This modi-
fied PBS buffer consisted of 1% dextrose and 0.5% BSA to prevent
fast settling and nonspecific aggregation, respectively; and this was
filtered using a 0.22-micron filter (Millipore PES Membrane) to
remove dust and reduce clogging of the channel. The chip was
primed right before running the experiment with 0.1% F-127
(MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) diluted in PBS. Once the buffer
and PDMS device were prepared, the diluted RBC suspension was
mixed gently with a pipette and drawn into a syringe using a 21 G
needle, a 750 μm ID tube to keep the seal tight and connect the
needle to the inlet of the chip. Flow rates of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
and 0.4 ml/min corresponding to the Reynolds numbers of 0.6, 3,
6, 12, 18, and 24, respectively, were used. All flow conditions were
allowed to stabilize for 1 min before commencing the video
recording.
Image acquisition
The RBC movement within the microfluidic channel was
monitored with a 20× objective/aperture 7 (Leica Dmi8 and
LAS-X). Microscope settings also included 255 brightness intensity.
The images were captured using a high-speed camera (Phantom
VEO 410-L). The images were captured at 10 068 fps at a resolution
of 1024 × 512 with an exposure time of 1 μs. The RBC distribution
was averaged from 100 ms duration of frames for lower Re and
from 10 ms duration of frames for higher Re.
Image analysis
The images were analyzed offline using ImagePro 10 (Media
Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). Using inbuilt background subtraction
and contrast enhancement algorithms, the RBCs were isolated from
the background based on an intensity histogram. Using a custom
MATLAB code, each image was binarized. To quantify RBC distri-
bution from the binarized images, the images were divided into
zones using grids 15.19 × 20.21 μm2. The percentage of white pixels
was calculated for each grid; these numbers were the 2D area
density at that grid location. These values corresponded to specific
HCT values on the calibration curve relating area density to HCT.
μPIV experiments and analysis
μPIV image acquisition
To trace fluid streamlines, we used micro-Particle Image
Velocimetry (μPIV). Red fluorescent beads of 1 μm (Dyed Red
Aqueous trace fluid streamlinesFluorescent Particles,
Thermo
Scientific) were used as tracer particles. The stock solution was
sonicated and vortexed before preparing a 1:20 dilution of the
working solution, corresponding to a final concentration of 0.05%
w/v. The optical system was coupled with Nd: YAG double-pulse
(YAG200-15-QTL) with an emission wavelength of 532 nm and a
synchronizer (LaserPulse Model 610036). This μPIV system was
controlled using Insight 4G software (TSI Incorporated, Shoreview,
MN). The images were obtained at a repetition rate between 2500
and 18 754 Hz to obtain optimal images for further analysis.
During acquisition, an in situ point processing was performed
as a quick check to ensure that the PIV image pair obtained had
suitable Δt and adequate spot size. It was also necessary to verify
that the particle displacement lies within the interrogation region
for one spot analysis by using the quick point processing tool. This
analysis compares the signal-to-noise ratio to the threshold.
μPIV image analysis
The detailed image analysis was performed offline, and it con-
sisted of three steps: (1) Pre-processing: The quality of the image
was improved by using image subtraction and removing noise
using a minimum intensity operator; (2) Processing: A static mask
was drawn as a boundary around the walls of the channel. The cor-
relation between two spots was obtained using Fast Fourier
Transform, and the image match within a displacement range was
provided using the correlation function for each pixel. The peaks in
the correlation values were obtained using the Gaussian peak func-
tion to determine the displacement of the particles within the spot
pair. This information, along with Δt between the two frames, was
used
to
calculate
the
vector
direction
and
magnitude;

Post-processing: The data obtained were further processed to

vector was calculated using the median of the 5 × 5 neighborhood
vectors. The difference between the vector velocities was used as
tolerance to remove invalid vectors. Then, the removed vectors
were replaced with the local median values. Global vector validation
applied a range filter to the whole vector field, which was then used
to eliminate vectors with a velocity magnitude outside the user-
defined range. The spaces in the vector field due to failed SNR were
filled using the local mean of the 3 × 3 neighborhood. Vector

Gaussian-weighted mean of the vectors in a 3 × 3 neighborhood.
Computational fluid dynamic software was used for visualization
and presentation of the data (Tecplot 360, Bellevue, WA).
Computational fluid dynamics
A computational fluid dynamics study was performed to sim-
ulate flow behavior in the channels using COMSOL Multiphysics
software (Version 5.5). The simulations were performed in 3D
geometry. The material properties of water were used for the simu-
lations. Since the bead suspension was dilute (0.05%), it was
assumed that these particles do not impact the streamlines. No slip
condition was applied at the walls, and normal flow and suppressed
backflow were set at the outlet. Automatic meshing yielded a total
of 589 105 domain elements, 78 386 boundary elements, and 2901
edge elements. Water was perfused through the channel at the flow
rates corresponding to the experimental values, and the Navier–
Stokes equations were solved with flow boundary conditions. The
local velocities and streamlines were computed to compare with the
experimental results.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least three independent
times on different days, and each experiment was performed using
at least two different channels. RBC experiments were performed
on different days with blood drawn from three to six different
donors. The data were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test to
establish significance. A P < 0.05 was deemed as a statistically sig-
nificant difference.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Visualization of local hematocrit in the channel
We perfused a 5% hematocrit (HCT) suspension through the
valve at the channel Reynolds (Re) numbers of 0.6, 3, 6, 12, 18, and
24. The Re was calculated as Re ¼ Wvρ/μ, where W is the channel
height, v is the average velocity, and ρ and μ are the fluid density and
dynamic viscosity, respectively. For a femoral vein of ∼6 mm diame-
ter, these Re numbers correspond to a wall shear rate of ∼10–400 s−1.
The diameters of, and flow velocities in, the femoral and saphenous
veins are of the order of 0.5–12 mm and 1–40 cm/s, respectively, and
varies depending on the posture.20,27,28 Therefore, the Re in venous
flow is of the order of 1–75, which is comparable to our experimental
system. RBC distributions, visualized by brightfield microscopy, are
shown in Fig. S1 in the supplementary material. In order to quantify
these qualitative observations from the images, we prepared a calibra-
tion curve to map the image data to hematocrit estimations. To this
end, in a separate experiment, for various hematocrits ranging
between 0.1% and 20%, images of slowly moving RBCs were col-
lected, and the intensity of the RBCs over the background was quanti-
fied. As shown in Fig. S2 in the supplementary material, the pixel
intensities linearly correlated between 0.1% and 15% and saturated as
the hematocrit was increased beyond 15%. Based on this calibration,
relating 2D pixel densities to 3D hematocrit values, we computed the
local hematocrit throughout the channel at different Re numbers
(Fig. 2), with the color scale shown on the right corresponding to the
hematocrit value obtained from the calibration curve.
Figure 2 shows local hematocrit distributions that result from
flowing a feed solution of 5% hematocrit through the venous valve
with the Re numbers of 0.6, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24. At low Re
(Re = 0.6, 3, and 6), hematocrit distribution was uniform through
most of the channel at a value comparable to that of feed hemato-
crit [Figs. 2(a)–2(c)]. The actual values vary slightly on either side
of 5% because the suspension is dilute and the averaging process
during image analysis. The asymmetry observed particularly at
Re = 0.6 is due to the inevitable settling of RBCs at near zero flow
rates. At these Re numbers (Re = 0.6, 3, and 6), no RBCs were seen
in the valve sinus regions, which are the angled wing regions

numbers as indicated (a)–(f). The black arrows indicate the direction of flow in

color scale on the right depicts the hematocrit obtained by matching RBC distri-
butions shown in Fig. S1 in the supplementary material, with the calibration
curve shown in Fig. S2 in the supplementary material. The arrows at Re = 12

behind the sudden expansion. However, as the flow rate was
increased, at Re = 12, an RBC vortex on either side of the main
flow appeared. The vortex comprised less than ten cells on each
side of the channel entering the valve sinus regions from the main
channel flow. These vortices correspond to a local hematocrit of
<2%. At Re = 18 and 24, the RBC density increased in the vortex
regions significantly compared with that of Re = 12. We observed
that the local hematocrit levels in the vortices increased more than
the feed hematocrit levels to ∼8% at Re = 18, which increased to as
high a value as closer to 15% at Re = 24.
RBC distribution profiles
To compare the RBC distributions at different Re numbers
and different locations along the channel, we quantified the RBC
distribution along the cross sections at three locations, at the
entrance (140 μm before the constriction), at the expansion (70 μm
after the constriction), and at the exit (380 μm after the constric-
tion) (Fig. 3). At the entrance to the channel, the positions of the
RBCs were similar at all Re numbers, with the maximum hemato-
crit of ∼6% right in the middle of the channel. At the exit, the posi-
tions of the RBCs at all Re numbers, except the highest (Re = 18
and 24), show similar plateau shapes. This represents a fully devel-
oped flow at the exit that has an even distribution of RBCs across
the width of the channel. At Re = 18 and 24, the distributions differ
from those at lower Re by remaining flat through the channel cross
section, indicating flow that is still developing at the exit location.
The RBC distributions near the expansion of the channel
(blue line) capture the transition in distributions that occur with
the increase in Re. We observe that at a low Re of 0.6, nearing
creeping flows, the RBC distribution is fully developed ∼50 μm
after exiting the constriction, resulting in a distribution at the
expansion that matches that of exit [Fig. 3(b)]. As the Re is
increased to 6 and 12, the RBC distribution width at the expansion
resembles that of the entry more than the exit (narrow distribution
at the entry vs wide distribution at the exit). At these Re numbers
(6 and 12), the flow is no more creeping, and the effects of the
expansion are carried further downstream, and hence, the cells are
concentrated in a ∼100 μm region at the center of the channel.
As the Re is increased further to 18 and 24, we observe a
sudden increase in the RBC concentrations in the expansion region
(blue line). Unlike at Re = 0.6 or 12 where RBC distribution along
the cross section was uniform, the distributions at Re = 18 and 24
showed non-uniform patterns. At Re = 18, the distributions ranged
between 3% and 9%, while at Re = 24, the maximum hematocrit
was ∼12%, which was almost double the hematocrit at the center
of the channel. The local decrease and increase in hematocrit levels
are well visualized in the heatmap distributions shown in Figs. 2(e)
and 2(g).
Feed or bulk hematocrit is operationally used to define the
effects of RBCs on the formation and properties of venous
thrombi.14 Emerging evidence shows that RBCs directly modulate
thrombosis through several mechanisms, including thrombin gen-
eration, platelet activation, and clot strength.15 Our results from
Figs. 2 and 3 show that the valve hematocrit is higher than the bulk

hematocrit. It is likely that the difference in hematocrit between the
vortex and the bulk flow observed in dilute suspension in this work
will be more pronounced at physiological levels: for instance, a feed
hematocrit of 25% has a greater RBC concentration than the feed
near the channel walls in a sudden expansion when compared with
a feed of 5% hematocrit.25,29 Therefore, local hematocrit rather
than bulk hematocrit should be taken into consideration while
evaluating the effects of RBCs on venous thrombosis.
Entrapment of RBCs in vortices
As described in Figs. 2 and 3, RBC vortices were observed at
Re = 12, 18, and 24. We observed from high speed video micros-
copy (Movie M1 in the supplementary material) that, at a steady
state, the RBCs remained within the vortex region for the entire
duration of the analysis (2–5 s, at a frame rate of 10 068 fps). As a
representative analysis of vortex dynamics, we tracked the position
and velocities of individual RBCs in the vortex at Re = 18. Figure 4(a)
shows the position and velocity magnitudes of cells in the outer,
middle, and inner limit cycles of the vortex region. These trajecto-
ries
and
instantaneous
RBC
velocities
were
obtained
by
frame-by-frame tracking of the centroid of single cells. As Fig. 4(a)
shows, at the bottom of the vortex, as the cells travel with the
jetting stream, the velocity is as high as 1000 μm/s, and at the top
of the vortex and closer to the wall, the velocities drop to as low as
10–20 μm/s in the direction opposite to the main flow. Between
these velocity changes, the RBCs decelerate when they travel toward
the wall and accelerate when they join the forward flow. The near
zero velocities of the RBCs close to the wall may have consequences
in modulating the interaction and adhesion to the endothelial
lining of the blood vessels. This analysis shows that RBCs, once
entrapped in the vortices, follow their limit cycles with a long resi-
dence time. The average hematocrit in the vortices increased line-
arly and rapidly with increasing the Re beyond Re = 12 [Fig. 4(b)].
We also quantified the total RBCs that are trapped in the vortices
by summing up over the entire vortex region at each Re. At a Re
below 6, this value was nearly zero but increased rapidly at a higher
Re due to an increase in both the hematocrit and the size of the
vortex: at Re = 12, 18, and 24, the total RBCs were 10.2 ± 5.3,
75.1 ± 12.1, and 140.1 ± 5.3, respectively.
Development of microflows and vortices with increase
in Re
To understand the RBC distribution in vortex flows at Re = 12,
18, and 24, and an anomalous increase in hematocrit levels at
Re = 18 and 24, we sought to analyze the flow patterns in the chan-
nels that drive the RBC movement. Fluorescent beads were used to
track the flow patterns independent of and distinct from RBC distri-
bution patterns. μPIV was used to obtain the velocity profiles from
bead locations captured using high speed video microscopy. We
visualized and quantified streamlines through the channels at
Re = 3, 6, 12, and 18, noting that no RBC vortices were seen at
Re = 3 and 6. In Fig. 5, we show the streamlines and vorticity com-
puted from μPIV analysis at these four Re numbers. At a low Re
(Re = 3), a small amount of backflow was detected in the valve
pockets (velocity on the order of 10−3 m/s compared with 10−2 m/s
in the main channel). As the Re increased to 6, 12, and 18, we
observed an increase in the separation of the streamlines, and more
backflow into the valve pockets was seen.
To quantify the location of flow separation leading to back-
flows, we computed the vorticity throughout the channel from the
local velocity vectors estimated by μPIV using the equation
ω ¼ ∇ v. The vorticity distribution is shown as a heat map
overlay on the streamlines in Fig. 5. At Re = 3, we observe small
microvortices at the entrance to the channel. At Re = 6, the strength
of the vortices increases twofold and the location of flow separation
moves further downstream. At higher Re (=12 and 18), the strength
of the vortices increases further by several folds, and the point of
flow separation is pushed further downstream from the entrance.
However, the extremely high flow velocities closer to the center of
the channel precluded particle tracing at these locations.
The presence of fluid vortices without any RBC at Re = 3 and
6 suggests that other blood components may be transported into

on the average of five RBCs for each limit cycle; (b) average of local HCT within the vortex during steady circulation in vortical flows, obtained by summing over local

the venous valve sinuses. Unlike other studies where RBCs were
used to follow fluid streamlines, in this work, the fluid vortices
were tracked with smaller particles of size similar to that of platelets
(1 μm) and stiffer than the RBCs. Our observation at Re = 3 and 6
implies that while RBCs may not enter the valve pockets at these
low flow rates, smaller platelets may preferentially enter the valve
regions. Computational and experimental studies have shown the
margination of platelets driven by cell–cell collision or volume
exclusion, wherein more deformable RBCs drive less deformable
platelets toward the wall.24,30,31 Our results show that platelet mar-
gination can be a flow-driven phenomenon by transport along the
streamlines and can happen independent of volume exclusion or
due to collisions with RBCs.22,32,33
Flow separation results in atypical wall shear stress
The presence of forward and reversing velocity profiles due
to flow separation shown in Fig. 5 suggests that there are regional
variations in shear stress on channel walls. The shear rate distri-
bution is computed from the velocity vectors, using the equation
εxy ¼ 1/2(@v/@x þ @u/@y), where u and v are instantaneous local
velocities in the x and y directions, respectively. Based on the
μPIV measurements, we estimated the shear stresses along the
outer walls at the various Re numbers (Fig. 6). At a low Re,
Re = 0.6 (orange line), the wall shear rates are low due to unidirec-
tional creeping flows. At Re = 3 and 6, the flow separation and
vortices result in a stagnation point [as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)],
FIG. 5. Streamlines and vorticity distribution in vortical flows. From the μPIV measurements of instantaneous velocities, streamlines and vorticities were computed at the
indicated locations at the various Re numbers (a)–(d). RBC distributions from high speed imaging are also shown. The images show that although there is a significant vor-
ticity as seen at Re = 3 and 6, the recirculation of RBCs does not begin until the Reynolds number reaches 12. The point of flow separation advances downstream with an
increase in Re. At Re = 12 and 18, particle tracking was possible only at locations where the flows were not too high.

and the wall experiences both flow reversal and forward flow.
Correspondingly, the wall shear stress shows a non-monotonic
profile with zero shear stress stagnation point at a location less
than one channel width (∼200 μm). As the Re was increased
further to Re = 12 and 18 (green and gray), the large backflow
near the wall resulted in a high reverse shear stress at the wall,
with the stagnation point moving further downstream. These
data suggest that even at Re as low as 3, the walls may experi-
ence reversal of shear stress. Such regional variations in wall
shear stresses may have important consequences on endothelial
mechanotransduction and hence on its phenotype. Low flows in
the venous valve region drive endothelial cells to a low grade
inflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype. This phenotype
supports the adhesion of monocytes, which, in turn, is a rich
source of tissue factor and initiation of intrinsic pathway of
coagulation.34 The hypoxia induced by low flows may also play
a role in initiating thrombus development due to its effects on
endothelial cells.35
Estimation of threshold shear rates that drive RBC
distribution in valve pockets using μPIV and 3D CFD
simulations
Since no RBCs were seen in the vortices till Re = 12, the cell tra-
jectories do not follow the fluid streamlines in the vortex. When
Re < 12, the cells do not cross streamlines to enter the vortices, sug-
gesting that only at Re = 12, the energy necessary to drive the RBCs
from the main flow to the vortex is realized. In a bounded Poiseuille
flow, particles migrate toward the wall and occupy an equilibrium
position due to the balance between the shear-gradient-induced
lift force, which pushes the particles toward the wall, drag force due
to
the
motion,
deformation-induced
lift
force,
and
the
wall-effect-induced lift force due to the wall, which act in the oppo-
site direction, pushing the cells away from the wall.36 For straight
channel flows with a rigid particle, the shear-gradient-induced lift
force expression is given as FL ¼ CρG2a4, where C, ρ, G, and a are
the lift coefficient, fluid density, local shear rate, and particle radius,
respectively.37 Although the numerical validity of this expression
may not be accurate for suddenly expanding flow with deformable
cells, the scaling laws have been found to be applicable and used
for vortex-based fractionation of cells based on their sizes.36,38–40
Next, the deformation-induced lift force is dependent on RBC
deformability, which is a function of shear rate through the Capillary
number (Ca) of a RBC, which is defined by Ca ¼ μ_γa/σ, where
μ, _γ, a, and σ are the fluid viscosity, shear rate, RBC radius, and
shear modulus of the RBC membrane, respectively.41 Finally, the
cell–cell interactions also depend on shear rate.42 Therefore, for a
given particle size, the net lift force on a RBC will be determined by
the local shear rate.
To obtain further insights into this lift phenomenon on
RBC motion in vortical flows, we sought to estimate the shear
strain acting locally on the cells. Although at low Re (Re = 0.6
and 3), we were able to obtain the complete velocity profile from
μPIV in the flow separation regions, at higher Re (Re = 12 and
18), the high velocities near the center of the channel precluded
the tracking of particles and hence local velocities, which could
only be obtained farther from the center, and farther from the
regions where flow actually separates. Therefore, we used 3D
CFD simulations to obtain velocity profiles in regions that were
not feasible to obtain experimentally. We used COMSOL to solve
the Navier–Stokes equation to obtain three-dimensional (3D)
velocity vectors and compared it with μPIV measurements
(Fig. 7). These computations faithfully confirm the velocity pro-
files estimated using μPIV including creeping flows at Re = 0.6;
development and growth of microvortices at Re = 3 and Re = 6,
respectively; and the formation of vortices and stagnation points
near the wall at higher Re (Re = 12 and 18) (compare with Fig. 5).
In particular, we note that the velocity vectors from CFD simula-
tions match well at the various locations where experimental data
were available and the local velocities were within the sensitivity
limits of μPIV [Fig. 7(e)].
Having matched the experimental and computational velocity
fields either fully, at low Re, or partially at higher Re, we computa-
tionally determined the shear strain acting on the RBCs near the
FIG. 6. Wall shear rate distribution.
The shear rate distributions near the
wall in the recirculation regions were
obtained from the μPIV measurements
of instantaneous velocities at the indi-
cated Re. For the chosen coordinate
system, on the right wall, the shear
rates are negative for forward flows
and positive for reverse flows; and zero
shear indicates stagnation point. The
data are mean and SEM (n = 3).

entrance to the channel from where cells enter the valve pockets
[Fig. 8(a)]. Figure 8(b) shows the shear rate perpendicular to the
direction of main flow, plotted along the direction of flow at the y-
location corresponding to the edge of the constriction at the inlet
[within the white-bounded region in Fig. 8(a)]. We profiled the
strain rates because the inertial boundary layer separates along this
line to form laminar vortices (i.e., Moffatt corner eddy flow) in the
sudden expansion. As expected, the strains continue to decrease as
the fluid enters the sudden expansion, and at any given location,
increases with an increase in Re.
Since we observed flow separation at Re = 3 and 6, but RBCs
do not enter the vortices at these flow rates, we propose that a
shear rate lower than the maximum value at Re = 6 (∼1.8 × 105 s−1)
is not sufficient to drive the RBC into the vortex [Fig. 8(b), dotted
line]. But at Re = 12, when the shear rate increases to 2.5 × 105 s−1
or ∼200–250 Pa (for a viscosity of 1 cP), a few RBCs enter into the
vortices,
suggesting
that
this value represents the necessary
sideward momentum to drive RBCs into the valve pockets. The
increase in Re to 18 and 24 increases the shear rate linearly but the
lift force by square of the shear rate, thus resulting in driving many
RBCs into the vortices, resulting in a vortex hematocrit instead of a
feed hematocrit.
The scale-down experimental system is appropriate to investi-
gate the transport phenomena of RBCs isolated from small
volumes of fresh human blood without relying on a substitute. Yet,
it places certain limitations in translating the results to larger,
actual venous valves. As mentioned previously, by matching the Re,
we maintained flow patterns and regime in the scale-down model
similar to those in femoral and saphenous veins. This means that
the flow velocity and shear rates in the smaller microchannels are
larger than those in in vivo veins. Hence, compared with the
model, RBCs in venous valves will not only travel at lower velocity
but will also experience different levels of lift forces. Another inher-
ent constraint in the scale down model is the confinement-related

effects since RBC deformability is known to be altered in cell-sized
channels.43 Although we do not expect confinement effects at a
single cell level in our microchannels since they are ∼6× larger
than the hydrodynamic diameter of RBCs, it is plausible that these
effects may be felt due to cell–cell interactions. Therefore, the shear
rate–vortical dynamics relationship in venous valves may be differ-
ent from what is observed in our model microchannels due to the
aforementioned scaling effects.44,45 Nonetheless, the experimental
flow patterns and RBC distribution data presented in this work,
together with our recent report on RBC deformability,50 can be val-
uable for understanding RBC entrapment in venous valves, such as
through computationally intensive multiscale simulations.46
It is appropriate to note some of the experimental adaptations
in this in vitro study that limit the applicability of our conclusions
directly to the pathophysiology of venous thrombosis. We have
used dilute red cell suspensions which are ∼10× lower than physio-
logical RBC concentrations so as to isolate fluid–cell interactions
on RBC distribution. However, at higher RBC concentrations, cell–
cell interactions may dominate fluid–cell interactions, and the local
changes in hematocrit may be even more pronounced than what is
reported in this study. We have used steady flow that does not
capture pulsations, which are believed to be prominent due to
muscle contraction, and can affect the dynamics of RBC entry and
exit from the vortex.47,48 Furthermore, we have used stiff valves
with an elastic modulus that is tenfold higher than healthy valve
tissues; and we have used a valve expansion ratio of 1:10, while the
expansion ratio for a healthy valve is 1:4. Of interest, the valve
tissue becomes stiffer with aging due to fibrotic tissue formation,
and the stiff valve does not open fully in response to pressure drop.
Future work will extend to μPIV measurements to investigate the
impact of pliable valves and expansion ratios on RBC transport
while accounting for RBC deformability, RBC distribution, confine-
ment effects, and cell–cell interactions.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we have shown that vortical flows in microchan-
nels of geometry similar to venous valve pockets result in anoma-
lous local RBC distribution, which can be significantly different
from the feed or bulk hematocrit. We have also shown that shear
rates determine whether RBC trajectories follow fluid streamlines
into the microchannel pockets. The μPIV-based quantification
shows small recirculating flow regions that do not contain RBCs
and regions with RBCs that are trapped in infinite limit cycles.49
Finally, the vortical flows also result in stasis and reversal of shear
rate directions on the vessel walls. These findings illustrate that vor-
tical flows due to sudden expansion can alter the local composition
of cellular components and also local shear rates, thus influencing
all three vertices of Virchow’s triad implicated in mural or
device-related thrombosis. Beyond relevance to venous thrombosis,
our findings also provide experimental insights into inertial flow of
dilute suspensions in sudden expansions, which has applications in
microfluidics-based flow focusing for the separation of cells based
on size or deformability. Our data provide shear rate thresholds for
inertial focusing of cells into the expansions and increasing the sep-
aration efficiency by trapping them into the micro-vortices based
on their size.
