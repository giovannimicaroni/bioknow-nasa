ABSTRACT
Force magnitudes have been suggested to drive the structural
response of bone to exercise. As importantly, the degree to which
any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or
constrained, by regional variation in the capacityof marrow progenitors
to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Here, we investigate the
relationship between bone adaptation and mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC) responsivity in growing mice subject to exercise. First, using a
force plate, we show that peak external forces generated by forelimbs
during quadrupedal locomotion are significantly higher than hindlimb
forces. Second, by subjecting mice to treadmill running and then
measuring bone structure with μCT, we show that skeletal effects of
exercise are site-specific but not defined by load magnitudes.
Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated by
running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure
in either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular
structure. In contrast, in the ulna, femur and tibia, exercise led to
significant enhancements of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of
area. Trabecular structure was also enhanced by running in the femur
and tibia. Finally, using flow cytometry, we show that marrow-derived
MSCs in the femurare more responsive to exercise-induced loadsthan
humeral cells, such that running significantly loweredMSC populations
only in the femur. Together, these data suggest that the ability of the
progenitor population to differentiate toward osteoblastogenesis may
correlate better with bone structural adaptation than peak external
forces caused by exercise.

INTRODUCTION
Numerous aspects of organismal structure and function can be
positively affected by load-bearing exercise, not least of which is the
skeleton. Studies of humans and otheranimals frequently demonstrate
the potential for activities such as running and jumping to promote
bone formation, delay bone loss, and, ultimately, enhance skeletal
structure and strength (e.g. Woo et al., 1981; Biewener and Bertram,
1994; Lieberman et al., 2003; McKayet al., 2005; Weeks et al., 2008).
Yet, as potent an anabolic stimulus as exercise may be, the parameters
of the regimenthat stimulate bone’s adaptive response remaindifficult
to identify, nor is it clear if all elements of the skeleton are equally
responsive to loading.
Itisoftenpresumedthatskeletalbenefitsofexerciseareproportional
to load magnitudes, and thus the greatest structural enhancement is
expected where the greatest functional challenges occur (Tommerup
et al., 1993; Nikander et al., 2006; Wilks et al., 2009). A well-known
example of focal adaptation to physical demand is the humeral
hypertrophyof the playing arms of tennis players and baseball pitchers
relative to their non-playing arms (Jones et al., 1977; Haapasalo et al.,
2000; Warden et al., 2014). Implicitly, these athletes demonstrate the
ability of bone to perceive and respond to biophysical signals in a site-
specific manner, perhaps to maintain an optimal mechanical
environment to cells regulating the response (Rubin, 1984).
Notwithstanding load magnitudes, it is also possible that the site-
specificity of skeletal adaptation to exercise is defined to some
extent by regional variation in the mechanoresponsiveness of bone
progenitor cells. The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is a pluripotent
progenitor that has the ability to differentiate into cells that form
bone, fat, tendon, muscle and ligament. Accumulating evidence
indicates that fate selection of marrow-based MSCs is influenced by
mechanical signals, biasing differentiation of MSCs toward bone
and away from fat (Luu et al., 2009a; Ozcivici et al., 2010; Chan
et al., 2012; Pagnotti et al., 2012). It has further been shown that
bone marrow in some skeletal elements may contain MSCs with
greater osteogenic potential than those located in the marrow of
other elements (Risbud et al., 2006; Volk et al., 2012), which would
suggest that some bones may be more responsive to exercise-
induced mechanical signals than others.
In this study, we used a mouse model to examine the site-
specificity of the adaptive response to treadmill-running exercise
in five weight-bearing limb bones (humerus, radius, ulna, femur
and tibia) and a non-weight-bearing cranial bone (interparietal).
If the presumption that higher loads cause more structural
enhancement
is
true,
then
anabolic
adaptation
would
be
expected to be greatest in those skeletal regions subject to the
highest loads. Alternatively, if the adaptive response to exercise
failed to correlate with load magnitude, perhaps it would better
associate with a biological rather than a mechanical parameter,
specifically, the osteoprogenitor population.

determined whether the forelimbs or hindlimbs experience greater
external forces during mouse quadrupedal locomotion. To this end,
the vertical component of peak ground reaction forces generated by
steady-state symmetrical gaits was measured in a sample of outbred
female mice (N=10; 6–7 weeks old) using a force plate. Over a range
of speeds chosen by the animals, involving both walking and
running gaits, peak forces generated by the forelimbs were
significantly higher than those experienced by the hindlimbs
(P<0.0001; Fig. 1). Therefore, if the skeleton’s adaptive response to
exercise correlates with load magnitude, then elevated locomotor
activity would be expected to augment bone structure more in the
forelimbs than the hindlimbs.
Effects of running on skeletal structure
The skeletal effects of exercise were established through an
experiment in which a second cohort of female mice from the
same outbred stock were either treated with a treadmill-running
regimen for 4 weeks (N=20) or served as sedentary controls (N=20),
beginning shortly after weaning (4 weeks of age). Animals assigned
to the treadmill group ran 5 days week−1 for 30 min day−1.
At the beginning of the experiment, body mass was not
significantly different between the experimental groups (P=0.15;
Fig. 2A). In both groups, body mass increased steadily over the
course of the experiment, with the most rapid increase occurring
during the first week. By the end of the experiment, body mass
remained similar between controls and runners (P=0.49). Limb
muscle mass was also not significantly different between groups at
the end of the experiment (triceps brachii: P=0.32, quadriceps:
P=0.29, triceps surae: P=0.49; Fig. 2B). Home-cage activity
quantified at the end of week 3 of the exercise program was
comparable between groups (Fig. 2C), such that the total number
of
ambulatory
movements
over
24 h
did
not
significantly
differ between controls and runners (P=0.50; Fig. 2D). Thus, any
differences in skeletal structure between groups can be confidently
attributed to exercise treatment, rather than group differences in
body size, muscle mass or cage activity.
The effects of treadmill running on skeletal structure (quantified
with μCT) were found to vary greatly across anatomical regions
(Table 1; Fig. 3). In the cranium, where loads produced by running
were presumably lowest, the thickness of interparietal cortical
bone was not significantly altered by exercise treatment (P=0.19;
Fig. 3A,B), nor was interparietal total thickness (P=0.20). Similarly,
in the forelimb, where external loads generated by running were
highest, exercise failed to significantly augment mid-diaphyseal
cortical bone structure in either the humerus or radius (Fig. 3C).
By contrast, in the ulna, running led to 6.9±3.0% greater
mid-diaphyseal cortical area (P=0.024) and 7.9±2.8% greater total
(subperiosteal) area (P<0.01), as well as a 15.7±7.2% increase in
maximum second moment of area (P=0.036) and a 15.4±6.6%
increase in minimum second moment of area (P=0.026). In the
hindlimb, where running-induced external load magnitudes were
lower than in the forelimb, exercise resulted in several significant
cortical bone structural enhancements in both the femur and tibia.
Compared with controls, runners had femora with 11.4±3.1% larger
mid-diaphyseal cortical area (P<0.001), a 9.7±2.6% thicker cortex
(P<0.001) and 5.9±2.7% larger total area (P=0.032). In runners,
femoral mid-diaphyseal maximum and minimum second moments
of area were increased by 17.2±6.0% (P<0.01) and 16.2±5.6%
(P<0.01), respectively. In the tibia, relative to controls, runners had
11.0±3.3% larger mid-diaphyseal cortical area (P<0.01), a 3.6±
1.5% thicker cortex (P=0.025) and 9.1±3.1% larger total area
(P<0.01). Tibial mid-diaphyseal maximum and minimum second
moments of area were enhanced in runners by 20.2±6.4% (P<0.01)
and 21.0±6.6% (P<0.01), respectively.
Responsivity of trabecular bone to exercise was also observed to
vary among limb elements (Table 2; Fig. 3D). In the forelimb,
exercise failed to significantly affect trabecular morphology in the
distal humeral epiphysis. By contrast, in the hindlimb, trabecular
bone volume fraction in the distal femoral metaphysis was 24.1±
11.4% greater in runners compared with controls (P=0.041) and

trabecular number was 12.2±5.8% higher (P=0.043). Moreover, in
the proximal tibial metaphysis, trabeculae were 9.3±4.1% thicker as
a result of running (P=0.028).
Marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells
The responsivity to exercise of marrow-derived MSCs in the
humerus and femur was determined by treating a third cohort
of female mice from the same outbred stock (N=6) to 5 days of
treadmill running (30 min day−1) beginning at 6 weeks of age and
comparing MSC populations at the end of the experimental period
(quantified with flow cytometry) with those obtained from a sample
of age-matched controls (N=17). In the humerus, MSCs in the bone
marrow population, identified as positive for SCA-1, c-Kit, CD90.2,
CD105 and CD44 surface antigens (Fig. 4A,B), did not differ
between runners and controls (P=0.39; Fig. 4C), whereas in the
femur, running significantly lowered the number of MSCs
(P=0.044), implying that they had been signaled away from their
progenitor state. The number of MSCs relative to marrow cavity
volume was not significantly different between the two bones in
controls (P=0.61; Fig. 4D), indicating that baseline density of MSCs
in the humerus and femur was similar.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates the adaptive capacity of the mouse skeleton
to be site-specific, with some regions being more responsive than
others to exercise-induced loads. Treadmill running stimulated
significant cortical bone structural enhancement in the femur, tibia
and ulna, whereas cortical structure failed to respond in the humerus
and radius, despite external load magnitudes being significantly
higher in the forelimb as opposed to the hindlimb. Trabecular
structure was also significantly enhanced by exercise in the femur
and tibia, but exercise failed to initiate an anabolic response in the
humerus. Cranial bone morphology was not influenced by running,
emphasizing the absence of a systemic stimulus for bone growth.
These results are inconsistent with any hypothesis predicting that
skeletal adaptation is proportional to external load magnitudes and
oppose the idea that exercise releases a systemic humor that
stimulates a generic response.
If skeletal adaptation to exercise was not correlated with load
magnitude, what biological parameter might have modulated
variation in bone responsivity? That the density of MSCs per unit
volume of marrow space was comparable in the humerus and femur
of controls undermines any conclusion that bases the differential
structural response of those two bones on a difference in baseline
availability of osteoprogenitors. There was, however, a significant
reduction in the number of MSCs in the femora of exercised animals
compared with controls, but no significant difference was observed
in the humerus. First, these data imply that cortical and trabecular
enhancement of the femur might be related to the recruitment of
MSCs toward osteoblastogenesis (Luu et al., 2009a). Although the
cortical response primarily affected the periosteal surface rather than
the endosteal surface, this does not preclude the possibility that
marrow-derived MSCs contributed to the observed cortical growth,
as there is evidence that MSCs migrate outside the marrow cavity to

be recruited at the periosteum and other sites (Luu et al., 2009b).
Second, these data indicate that MSCs in the humerus were less
responsive to mechanical signals, either because of reduced cellular
mechanosensitivity per se (Volk et al., 2012), or perhaps due to
aspects of the marrow niche (e.g. adjacency to hematopoietic stem
cells, higher concentration of adipocytes, marrow viscosity) that
confounded the ability of MSCs to commit to an osteoblast lineage
(Adler et al., 2014; Metzger et al., 2015). These interpretations must
be considered with caution, because changes in MSC numbers
alone are not a direct indication of differentiation activity toward
osteoblast production, and we did not directly show here that
osteoblast numbers increased with exercise treatment. Nevertheless,
the observed associations between changes in MSCs and bone
structure are compelling.
Teleologically, it is not clear why mouse forelimb bones would
be less responsive to exercise than hindlimb bones, although it
may relate to maintaining a lightly built architecture for the
appendage that is also routinely used for manipulation. Yet, from a
broad evolutionary perspective, it is easier to imagine how it could
be advantageous in some instances for certain bones to be more or
less affected by mechanical signals. In migratory birds, for
example, if routinely large wing forces were to lead to equally
large gains in bone mass, then this would probably deleteriously
increase energetic costs of flight (Dumont, 2010). Similarly, if
woodpecker crania were to become progressively thickened with
every bout of tree drumming, then this could constrict tiny
foramina and damage vital nerves and blood vessels. At the other
extreme, bones that rarely sustain large loads, such as elements of
the inner ear, would be likely to erode away over time (Schutz
et al., 2014). Thus, evolution of bone adaptability can be expected
to have involved some degree of fine-tuning of responsivity across
different skeletal locations in order to achieve site-specific
compromises
between
maintaining
equilibrium
mechanical
conditions while still ensuring that bones preserve optimal
structure for their respective functional roles (Lieberman and
Crompton, 1998; Currey, 2002; Lieberman et al., 2003). Bone
progenitors are perhaps just one of several cells that orchestrate
such regional variation in skeletal responsivity.
It is important to emphasize that to characterize the mechanical
environmentof the forelimbs and hindlimbsduring exercise,we relied
on a force plate to quantify only peak external limb forces. We did not
attempt, however, to calculate internal forces (stresses) or measure
in vivo strains experienced by the individual bones during running.
Lacking bone stress and strain data, we cannot exclude the possibility
that differences in mechanical signals experienced locally by forelimb
and hindlimb bones were not as great as suggested by external limb
forces. Indeed, this seems likely in light of evidence that peak bone
stresses/strains are generally similar between homologous limb
elements (e.g. humerus, femur) among quadrupeds (Biewener,
1983) and across different limb elements among a variety of
animals (Rubin and Lanyon, 1984; Biewener, 1990). Such broad
uniformity in local mechanical signals is possible due to numerous
suites of evolutionary adaptations related to anatomy (e.g. skeletal
allometry, bone curvature) and locomotor kinematics and kinetics
(e.g. speed, joint posture) that modulate variation in external forces
(Biewener, 1990). However, even with internal forces and tissue
deformation magnitudes being broadly similar, the difference in
osteogenic response between proximal forelimb and hindlimb
elements of the mice in this study is clear. Therefore, it is plausible
that our conclusion that the responsiveness of bone to exercise-
induced loading was not proportional to external force magnitude
could also apply to local stresses and strains; but a rigorous test of this
hypothesis would require a different approach than that adopted here.
Beyond possible implications of this study for the physiological
response of bone to exercise, this study is also relevant for
paleontologists, including paleoanthropologists, who attempt to

deduce the physical activity patterns of ancient species based on the
morphology of fossils (Ruff, 2005). Frequently, researchers
compare the diaphyseal structure of hominin upper limbs with
that of lower limbs in order to infer the emphasis placed on activities
involving upper limb loading, such as arboreal climbing, relative to
lower limb loading, particularly bipedal locomotion (e.g. Ruff,
2008, 2009). This approach assumes that upper and lower limb
bones respond in the same way to loading, such that their diaphyseal
structure similarly reflects loading history. The results of this study
do not support this presumed homogeneity in bone responsiveness
across limbs. Moreover, paleoanthropologists have interpreted thick
cranial bones in ancient hominins as evidence of high physical
activity levels, based on the assumption that physical activity
systemically enhances skeletal structure (e.g. Lieberman, 1996,
1998). This assumption is also not supported by our findings.
Overall, the results of this study suggest that effects of physical
activity on the skeleton can be unpredictable and, likewise, that
caution is necessary when using fossils to glean information about
the behavioral patterns of ancient species.
In summary, this study provides yet another example of the
importance of load-bearing exercise in influencing skeletal structure
and strength, in this case, in a site-specific manner. Ultimately, this
study supplies evidence (albeit preliminary) that the MSC, the cell
that must be recruited to form bone, may be differentially responsive
to mechanical signals, either because of variation in cellular
mechanosensitivity or because the niche in which it resides is
influencing the ability of the progenitor to commit to a particular
tissue lineage. Additional research of this subject is warranted
because it could yield important insights pertinent to the design of
exercise programs and technologies aimed at improving human
skeletal structure and strength with biophysical signals. It would
also aid our understanding of bone adaptation to mechanical loads,
thus providing a more solid basis for interpreting bone structure
from a functional point of view.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All experiments and procedures were reviewed and approved by the Stony
Brook University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. At
weaning age, female Hsd:ICR mice (N=73) were acquired from Harlan
Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and housed individually in
standard cages and maintained on a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle with free
access to water and chow. At 4 weeks of age, animals were divided into three
groups: cohort 1 was used to measure limb forces (N=10), cohort 2 was used
to assess the skeletal effects of treadmill exercise (N=40), and cohort 3 was
used to examine the responsivity of marrow-derived MSCs to exercise
(N=23). Young animals were used because skeletal adaptability to exercise
is typically greatest during the growing years (Rubin et al., 1992; Lieberman
et al., 2003; Main et al., 2014). At the conclusion of each experiment,
animals were killed by cervical dislocation preceded by inhalation of either
CO2 (cohorts 1 and 2) or isoflurane (cohort 3).
Limb force recordings
The design, calibration and use of the force plate has been described in detail
elsewhere (Riskin et al., 2009; Wallace et al., 2015) and is only briefly
summarized here. The plate consists of a stiff fiberfoam surface
(28 cm×28 cm) supported at two opposite ends by aluminium beams with
spring blade elements fitted with strain gauges. Signals from gauges were
amplified, digitized and saved to a computer. The plate was modified for
collection of single-limb contacts by affixing a thin wooden strip to the plate
surface and covering the rest of the plate with a runway. Animals in cohort 1
traveled freely in a clear tunnel (44 cm long×7 cm wide) placed over the
runway. The relationship between vertical force magnitude and voltage
output was determined by applying a range of known weights to the wooden
strip. Regressions of force to voltage were linear (R2>0.999). Ground
reaction forces recorded at 1000 Hz and video recorded in lateral view at
500 Hz were synchronized with a ProCapture motion analysis system
(Xcitex, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). Animal speed was determined from

video as the time required for a fixed anatomical landmark (i.e. the nose) to
pass between markers on either side of the runway. Force data were filtered
with a 30 Hz low-pass Butterworth filter and extracted with ProAnalyst
software (Xcitex, Inc.). Data from between 5 and 10 forelimb and hindlimb
contacts were collected per animal (N=78 total for each limb).
Treadmill exercise
Runners in cohorts 2 and 3 (N=20 and 6, respectively) were exercised
5 days week−1 ona six-lanetreadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus,OH,
USA) at a rate of 12 m min−1 for 30 min day−1. Exercise treatment of cohort 2
began at 4 weeksofageand lasted for 4 weeks, andtreatment ofcohort 3began
at 6 weeks of age and lasted for 1 week. Controls in cohorts 2 and 3 (N=20 and
17, respectively) were handled similar to exercising mice but did not run.
Home-cage activity
Home-cage activity of animals in cohort 2 was quantified with a 16-
chamber Opto-M3 system (Columbus Instruments), in which each cage
was placed into an apparatus that cast a grid of infrared beams (1.27 cm2)
above the cage floor. No additional stimulus was supplied by the system
and animals retained free access to water and chow. Activity was quantified
as the total number of times that a new beam was broken. Recurrent
interruptions of beams caused by non-ambulatory movements (e.g.
scratching, grooming) were disregarded.
Muscle mass
In cohort 2, right and left triceps brachii, quadriceps femoris and triceps
surae muscles were removed with a scalpel and weighed on an electronic
balance (Acculab VI-3mg; Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany). Right and
left muscle mass values were averaged. Triceps brachii was cut at its
proximal origins at the humeral neck and greater tubercle and the caudal
scapular border, and at its distal insertion at the ulnar olecranon process.
Quadriceps was cut proximally from its origins at the cranial aspect of the
femur, the femoral neck, and the greater and third trochanters, and distally at
its insertion at the patellar ligament. Triceps surae was cut at its proximal

origins at the medial and lateral femoral epicondyles and the fibular head,
and at its distal insertion at the calcaneal tendon.
Microcomputed tomography
In cohort 2, right limb bones were scanned in distilled water at a 10 μm3
voxel size (70 kVp, 114 μA, 150 ms integration time) using a μCT 40
scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland). Cortical bone
structure was assessed in a 300-μm-long region of the tibial diaphysis and in
600-μm-long regions of the diaphyses of other limb bones. The humeral
volume of interest (VOI) began 100 μm distal to the deltoid tuberosity, and
the VOI in the other four limb elements was centered at half bone length. A
smaller VOI for the tibia relative to other bones was deemed appropriate
given the large degree of longitudinal structural variation along the shaft of
that element (Bab et al., 2007). Trabecular bone was assessed in a 300-μm-
long region of the distal humeral epiphysis starting 100 μm proximal to the
cortical–trabecular bone interface, in a 1100-μm-long region of the distal
femoral metaphysis starting 850 μm proximal to the growth plate, and in a
600-μm-long region of the proximal tibial metaphysis starting 500 μm distal
to the growth plate. Although most studies of trabecular bone in rodents
focus on bone tissue in the metaphysis rather than the epiphysis (Bouxsein
et al., 2010), the humeral distal epiphysis was analyzed in this study because
of the low quantity of trabecular bone in mouse humeral metaphyses (Bab
et al., 2007). Volumes were segmented using a constrained 3D-Gaussian
filter to reduce noise [support=1, sigma=0.1 (diaphysis) and 0.5 (epiphysis
and metaphysis)] and thresholded to extract the bone phase. Threshold
values chosen for cortical and trabecular bone (593.1 and 428.1 mg
HA/cm3, respectively) were determined empirically to achieve maximal
concordance between raw and thresholded images (Judex et al., 2004).
Trabecular bone was isolated from the cortical shell using an automated
algorithm (Lublinsky et al., 2007). Interparietals were scanned using the
same scanner settings as those used for limb bones. Volumes were filtered
(3D Gauss; support=1, sigma=0.1) and thresholded at 634.4 mg HA/cm3.
Cortical layers were separated from the diploë using an automated algorithm
(Copes, 2012). All bone properties were computed using the internal
imaging code supplied by the scanner manufacturer, and were defined as
recommended (Bouxsein et al., 2010). Structural data from the femur have
been reported previously (Wallace et al., 2015).
In cohort 3, right humeriand femorawere scanned dryat a 20 μm3 voxel size
(70 kVp, 114 μA, 150 ms integration time). μCT image processing followed
the same protocol as in cohort 2. Marrow cavity volume was calculated using
the BoneJ plugin for ImageJ (Doube et al., 2010). The humeral marrow cavity
VOI was defined proximally by the growth plate and distally by the coronoid-
olecranon notch. The femoral VOI was defined proximally by the most
projecting point of the lesser trochanter and distally by the growth plate.
Flow cytometry
Cellular constituents of bone marrow were quantified in left humeri and
femora of animals in cohort 3 immediately after death. Using a 25AWG
needle, bone marrow was flushed from each endocortical cavity with
supplemented medium, then mixed, and filtered through a 40 μm mesh (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Supplemented medium was prepared
with Dulbecco’s modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 2% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10 mmol l−1 HEPES buffer
(Life Technologies, Inc.). Bone marrow erythrocytes were lysed with 1×
PharmLyse (BD Biosciences). Samples were diluted in Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 1:100. A hemocytometer
was used to quantify the number of cells in each sample. This enabled back
calculation of the total number of marrow cells within each bone. A single-
cell suspension containing 2×106 cells from each sample was then prepared
to identify MSC populations through direct immunofluorescence staining
with flow cytometry. Specifically, fluorescent antibody probes for SCA-1,
c-Kit, CD90.2, CD105 and CD44 (BD Biosciences) were designated as the
unique MSC surface identifiers (Pagnotti et al., 2012), and populations
positive for all five markers were sub-gated accordingly using FlowJo
cytometric analytical software (TreeStar, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). The
percentage of MSCs within each 2×106-cell sample was used to calculate the
total number of MSCs within each bone.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS (v20; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA). Analysis of covariance was used to compare peak vertical ground
reaction forces experienced by the forelimbs and hindlimbs of animals in
cohort 1, with subject speed as the covariate (Wallace and Demes, 2008).
Independent-samples t-tests were used to assess differences in body mass,
muscle mass and bone traits between controls and exercised animals in
cohort 2. Mann–Whitney U-tests were used to compare home-cage activity
between controls and runners in cohort 2 (because of non-normal
distribution of data), as well as MSC populations between controls and
runners in cohort 3 (because of uneven sample sizes). A paired-sample t-test
was used to compare MSC density in the humeri and femora of controls in
cohort 3. Significance level for tests was P<0.05 and tests were two-tailed.
Relative differences between group means were calculated as percentage
difference±s.d. of the sampling distribution of the relative difference
(Wallace et al., 2015).
