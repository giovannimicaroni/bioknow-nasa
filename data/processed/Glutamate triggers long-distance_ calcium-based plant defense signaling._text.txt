Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability,
whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have
evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that
trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with envir-
onmental challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously con-
structed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library identiﬁes a glutathione (GSH)-
deﬁcient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously
deﬁned wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but dis-
harmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further
uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE
RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense
signaling events in plants. Our ﬁndings offer new insights into highly sophis-
ticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against her-
bivory and pathogen invasion.
Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take
prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information
exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian ner-
vous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including
amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, nor-
epinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as
neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then acti-
vate ion channels, and consequently produce ion ﬂux1, thereby indu-
cing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for
neurotransmission1–4.
Plants are characterized by lack of a nervous system but still have
the ability to systematically communicate the environmental signals
from the site of perception to the distal tissues5. In response to her-
bivorous insect attack or wounding at local leaves, wound signaling
molecules are released at the damaged plant cells, and may bind cor-
responding receptors to trigger propagation of slow wave potentials
(SWPs)6–9, initiate transmission of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt)10–15,
and consequently activate biosynthesis of defensive phytohormone

(JA),

responsive genes for systemic defense responses in plants7,8,11,12,16–18.
Many different types of chemical substances were revealed as
neurotransmitters that induce long-distance ionic responses to effec-
tively mediate neurotransmission in mammals4. However, in plant
kingdom, only an amino acid and a protein, namely the glutamate (Glu)
and the recently discovered “Ricca’s factor” β-THIOGLUCOSIDE GLU-
COHYDROLASE (TGG) are so far deﬁned as wound signals that depend
on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) protein, the homologous protein of
mammalian ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs), to activate systemic

plant defense response6,7,11. In this study, our genetic screening of the
previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library19 iden-
tiﬁed a glutathione (GSH)-deﬁcient mutant that highly accumulated
Glu, the previously deﬁned molecule crucial for activation of plant
defense, but disharmoniously exhibited attenuation of defense sig-
naling events. We further uncovered GSH as a critical signaling mole-
cule that relies on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance propagation of
calcium-based defense signaling events.
Results
Identiﬁcation of GSH as a signaling molecule that activates long-
distance plant defense signaling events
During the genetic screening of the rolling circle ampliﬁcation-
mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library19,20 for
mutants with altered defense response to a disastrous plant fungal
pathogen Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea), we identiﬁed a mutant, termed
hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52), which exhibited obvious susceptibility to B.
cinerea infection (Supplementary Fig. 1). A single gene AT4G23100 was
identiﬁed with PCR analysis on the mutant genomic DNA19,20.
To further verify that the decreased resistance in the hr-52 mutant
is caused by the interference with AT4G23100 gene, we obtained the
previously reported mutant pad2-1 with the Ser298Asn substitution
(S298N) within AT4G2310021 to assess its responses to B. cinerea
infection and insect attack. The results showed that pad2-1 exhibited
severe susceptibility to B. cinerea and Spodoptera exigua, a globally
agricultural pest, while genetic transformation of pad2-1 with PAD2
(AT4G23100) completely restored the resistance (Supplementary
Figs. 2 and 3). Our results together with the previous ﬁndings21–23
demonstrate that AT4G23100 gene is essential for plant defense
response against B. cinerea infection and insect attack.
It was known that the AT4G23100 gene encodes the gamma-
glutamylcysteine synthetase catalyzing the reaction between Glu and
cysteine for generation of glutamylcysteine in the GSH biosynthesis
pathway24. We found that a high level of Glu (875.42 μg/g FW) was
accumulated in the pad2-1 mutant compared to WT (494.96 μg/g FW)
while the GSH content in pad2-1 (4.91 μg/g FW) was severely decreased
to 5.9% of WT (82.94 μg/g FW) (Fig. 1a, b). It is surprising that such a
high level of Glu failed to induce plant defense in pad2-1 (Supple-
mentary Figs. 2 and 3), which seems to be inconsistent with the pre-
viously deﬁned role of Glu as a critical wound signal that activates plant
defense response11. The observed susceptibility in the GSH-deﬁcient
pad2-1 mutant suggests an indispensable role for GSH in plant defense,
which encourages us to further investigate whether GSH acts as wound
signal to trigger long distance calcium-based defense signaling events.
To verify the role of GSH in activating long-distance plant defense
signaling events, we wounded leaf 1 of pad2-1 and Col-0, and then
measured the accumulation of wound-induced plant defensive hor-
monal molecules in leaf 6, considering that leaf n shares direct vascular
connections with leaves n ± 5 and n ± 8 while leaves n ± 3 may represent
contact parastichies formed by proximal but unconnected vasculature
in adult Arabidopsis rosettes7,25. Consistent with the reduced plant
resistance in pad2-1, the defensive phytohormone jasmonates were
obviously decreased in the leaf 6 of pad2-1 to ~63.04% (for JA) and
~45.81% (for JA-Ile) of those in Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1c, d).
Moreover, the expression of JA-inducible defense marker genes OPR3,
JAZ5, and JAZ7 was also signiﬁcantly attenuated in leaf 6 of pad2-1
compared to Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1e). These results sug-
gest that GSH might serve as a critical signaling molecule essential for
activation of plant systemic defense signaling events.
To further explore the underlying mechanism of GSH in activating
systemic plant defense responses, we introduced the [Ca2+]cyt reporter
GCaMP3 into pad2-1, generating GCaMP3/pad2-1 plant, to investigate
whether the GSH-deﬁcient mutant attenuated the wound-induced
systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission. Upon mechanical wounding of leaf 1,
both amplitude and kinetics of [Ca2+]cyt propagation in leaf 6 were
reduced in GCaMP3/pad2-1 compared with GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 1f, g;
Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). The peak value
of [Ca2+]cyt ﬂuorescence changes in leaf 6 of GCaMP3/pad2-1 was
reduced to ~44.15% of that in GCaMP3 (Fig. 1h). Consistently, the per-
centage of each systemic leaf that showed apparent increased [Ca2+]cyt
ﬂuorescence was reduced in GCaMP3/pad2-1 (Fig. 1i). These data
reinforce the role of GSH in triggering the wound-induced systemic
[Ca2+]cyt propagation in plants.
Taken together, the above-mentioned data suggest that GSH
might serve as an important wound signal thattriggers wound-induced
systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates
plant defense responses.
GSH triggers long-distance [Ca2+]cyt transmission
To further validate that GSH acts as a wound signal triggering long-
distance plant defense signaling events, we applied GSH (with Glu and
sorbitol as positive and negative controls, respectively) to leaf 1 of the
GCaMP3 plants and visualized the systemic [Ca2+]cyt in the whole
seedlings (Fig. 2a, b). Intriguingly, the fast and transient increase of
[Ca2+]cyt was notably triggered in systemic leaves (including leaf 3, 4,
and 6) by GSH (Supplementary Movie 3) at the level comparable to that
induced by Glu (Fig. 2a). Speciﬁcally, [Ca2+]cyt rapidly increased to the
peak value in leaf 6 at ~230 s upon treatment on leaf 1 with GSH rather
than sorbitol (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 4), and more distal leaves
showed [Ca2+]cyt propagation with the increased GSH concentrations
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt
transmission was dramatically repressed by pretreatment on the
petiole of the wounded leaf with the Ca2+ channel inhibitor LaCl3
(Fig. 2e-g). To exclude the possibility thatGSH is cleaved by enzymes to
release glutamate for Ca²⁺ signal propagation, we employed GGsTop, a
well-known chemical inhibitor that speciﬁcally targets gamma-
glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), the enzyme responsible for convert-
ing GSH to Glu26. Our results showed that there were no signiﬁcant
differences in the Ca²⁺ signaling response when GSH was used in
combination with GGsTop compared to that of GSH treatment alone
(Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that GSH was not converted to Glu
for activation of systemic Ca2+ signaling. Additionally, we synthesized
another tripeptide (Glu-Pro-Ala), which contains glutamate along with
two different amino acids, and investigated its effects in triggering
systemic Ca2+ signal propagation in plants. Unlike GSH treatment,
application of Glu-Pro-Ala failed to induce long-distance transmission
of Ca²⁺ signal in plants (Supplementary Fig. 7), reinforcing the role of
GSH as a signaling molecule that effectively triggers systemic [Ca2+]cyt
propagation in plants.
Consistently, GSH application on leaf 1 signiﬁcantly induced the
expression of defense-responsive genes (OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ10) in leaf
6 (by ~5.6, ~8.6 and ~5.7 folds), which is comparable to that induced by
Glu (Fig. 2d). Moreover, pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded
leaf with LaCl3 severely reduced the GSH-inducible expression of
defense genes in systemic leaves (Fig. 2h), verifying that propagation
of [Ca2+]cyt is required for GSH-induced defense gene expression.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that GSH acts as an important
wound signal in triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense
signaling.
GSH activates the transcriptional expression of defense-related
genes in plant systemic leaves
To get deeper insights into the GSH-triggered systemic defense
signaling events in plants, we performed transcriptome proﬁling on
leaf 6 collected after 1 h application of GSH to leaf 1 of WT plants.
We identiﬁed 378 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the sys-
temic leaf of GSH-treated plants compared to non-stimulated mock
control plants (Supplementary Data 1). Among them, 354 genes
including a large number of key defense-responsive genes were
upregulated while 24 genes were downregulated (Fig. 3a), which is

well consistent with the tendency of transcriptome data from plants
in response to wounding, namely, more transcripts are upregulated
than downregulated27,28. Gene Ontology analysis (GO) of these DEGs
further revealed signiﬁcant enrichment of terms associated with
plant defense signaling, including defense response, cellular
responses to JA, response to wounding, and response to hormone
(Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data 2). Consistent with the transcriptome
analysis, qRT-PCR also showed that expression of defense marker
genes (CYP94C1, JAZ13, LOX4, OPR3, JAZ5, JAZ7, and JAZ10) was
highly induced in the systemic leaf tissues of GSH-treated plants
(Fig. 3c, d; Supplementary Fig. 8). These data provide an overview of
the GSH-induced gene expression in plant systemic leaf tissues and
further indicate the important role of GSH in triggering plant long-
distance defense signaling.

To further investigate the relations between GSH and Glu in plant
wound response, we generated transcriptome data sets from leaf 6 1 h
after wounding leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 3) or application of Glu to
leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 4), and then compared these data to that
induced by GSH. This comparison showed that 207 DEGs were co-
regulated by wounding and GSH treatment, while 228 DEGs were
found in both GSH and Glu treatment groups. Moreover, a total of 267
DEGs from GSH- and Glu-treated groups existed in wounding treat-
ment, among which 126 genes were co-regulated by GSH, Glu and
wounding, 81 genes were only regulated by GSH and wounding, and 60
genes were only regulated by Glu and wounding (Fig. 3e). These
overlapped genes which are co-regulated by GSH, Glu, and wounding
or independently regulated by GSH and wounding, Glu and wounding
are all mainly involved in plant defense signaling, including plant
response to wounding, stress, JA, and biotic stimulus, regulation of cell
communication, and innate immune response, suggesting that GSH
and Glu are involved in wound-induced plant systemic defense
response.
GLR3.3 is required for GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt
propagation
GLR proteins which generally contain an amino-terminal domain
(ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain
(TMD), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), have broad agonist
proﬁles including glycine, cysteine, methionine, Glu and GSH29–32.
Specially, Glu-triggered long-distance [Ca2+]cyt propagation is drama-
tically inhibited in glr3.3glr3.6 mutant11. To ﬁgure out whether GSH-
triggered long-distance calcium signaling depends on GLR3.3 and
GLR3.6, we compared the GSH-triggered Ca2+-related signaling events
among the glr3.3, glr3.6 and WT plants containing the GCaMP3
reporter (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig. 9). Interestingly, the GSH-
triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was severely reduced in the
GCaMP3/glr3.3 (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 4). However, the GSH-
triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was not markedly attenuated
in GCaMP3/glr3.6, which is similar to that of GCaMP3 plant (Fig. 4a, b;
Supplementary Movie 5). Consistently, the GSH-inducible expression
of defense marker gene OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ10 was signiﬁcantly
repressed in the GCaMP3/glr3.3, but not obviously inhibited in the
GCaMP3/glr3.6 and the GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 4c). These results suggest
that GLR3.3 plays a dominant role in regulating GSH-induced [Ca2+]cyt
propagation. Similar to the systemic calcium signal transmission upon
GSH treatment, Glu-induced [Ca2+]cyt propagation in systemic leaves
were strongly inhibited in GCaMP3/glr3.3 while remained unaffected in
GCaMP3/glr3.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10), conﬁrming that Glu-induced
long-distance calcium wave is also dependent on GLR3.38,11.
To characterize the interaction between GLR3.3 and GSH, the
predicted structure of GLR3.3 was used to perform molecular
docking. The binding model showed that Glu binds to the LBD of
GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3LBD) (Supplementary Fig. 11), which is
consistent with the recent report about the Glu binding to the
GLR3.3LBD
29. While GSH was predicted to bind the ATD of GLR3.3
(referred to as GLR3.3ATD), which is remarkably different from Glu in
terms
of
binding
domains
and
contacting
amino
acids
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Consistent with the predicted interaction
between GLR3.3ATD and GSH (Supplementary Fig. 11), recent X-ray
crystallography and cryo-EM data revealed that GSH binds the ATD
of GLR3.430, another GLR protein with high sequence similarity to
GLR3.3, reinforcing that GSH might bind the ATD domain of GLR3.3
for activation of ion channel. Together with the genetic evidence
showing GLR3.3 is required for both GSH- and Glu-triggered sys-
temic [Ca2+]cyt transmission (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 10), these
results collectively suggest that GSH and Glu may bind to different
domains of GLR3.3 for activating ion channel activity and triggering
leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling.
Taken together, our results shown in Figs. 1–4 suggest that GSH
serves as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance propagation
of [Ca2+]cyt waves in a GLR3.3-dependent manner, thus inducing rapid
JA biosynthesis in systemic leaf organs to protect plants from herbiv-
ory ahead of time.
Discussion
Initiation of a rapid defense against biotic attacks and mechanical
damages is crucial for plant survival in changing environment. Due to
lack of a nervous system, plants have evolved sophisticated mechan-
isms to systemically deliver the wound signal from the site of injured
organs to the distal undamaged tissues, which helps them be well-
prepared for upcoming dangers33. In this study, we ﬁnd that the GSH-
deﬁcient mutant, in spite of the highly accumulated Glu previously
deﬁned as a critical wound signal essential for activating plant defense
events, showed impaired plant defense signaling events (Fig. 1; Sup-
plementary Figs. 1-3). We further deﬁne GSH as a critical wound signal
that depends on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance calcium-based
defense signaling in plants (Figs. 2–4; Supplementary Figs. 5-11). Intri-
guingly, in the animal nervous system, GSH has been identiﬁed as a
neuromodulator/neurotransmitter34–36, suggesting a potential con-
ceptual parallel in GSH-mediated signal transmission across different
kingdoms of life. Moreover, we noticed that GSH and Glu induced
distinct [Ca2+]cyt transmission patterns in systemic leaves. Speciﬁcally,
the spread of systemic [Ca2+]cyt triggered by GSH is preferentially
initiated from marginal veins and rapidly transmitted to the mid veins
(Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 6), whereas Glu
mediated [Ca2+]cyt transmission mainly propagated from mid veins to
marginal veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 7).
Re-examination of the data shown in the previous study revealing Glu
as a wound signal also supports our observation that Glu triggers
[Ca2+]cyt transmission with the direction of mid-to-marginal veins11.
Intriguingly, the transmission pattern of wounding-induced [Ca2+]cyt
contained both directions of the mid-to-marginal veins and the
marginal-to-mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary
Movie 8). Future work to elucidate the mechanisms and biological
signiﬁcance of different [Ca2+]cyt transmission patterns induced by
GSH and Glu would help us to further understand the highly sophis-
ticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against
insect attack.
When plants are subjected to insect herbivory or mechanical
wounding, they rapidly activate the JA signaling pathwayin whole plant

tissues, which in turn mediates the systemic defense responses against
insects10–12,37. In our study, we deﬁned GSH as a critical wound signal to
trigger long-distance [Ca2+]cyt transmission for activation of JA bio-
synthesis in distal organs, thereby inducing plant systemic defense
response (Figs. 1–4). Interestingly, as shown in our transcriptome data,
in addition to the pronounced enrichment of genes associated with JA
signaling in systemic leaf tissues after GSH treatment, genes respon-
sive to other defense phytohormones such as ethylene and salicylic
acid, which are responsible for plant resistance to pathogen infection,
are also highly upregulated (Supplementary Data 1), implying that GSH
might also act as a signaling molecule to activate the plant systemic
immune response. Previously recognized as an antioxidant, GSH is

intricately linked with reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling38. Our
transcriptome analysis also revealed that genes responsive to oxida-
tive stress were signiﬁcantly induced in the systemic leaf tissues fol-
lowing GSH treatment (Supplementary Data 1). Given that both
calcium and ROS signals play a role in mediating plant systemic
defense responses to wounding11,12,39–41, exploring the potential
involvement of ROS in GSH-triggered systemic defense response
would be interesting.
Wound-induced systemic defense signaling requires the involve-
ment of GLR ion channel proteins, such as GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. Our
study found that the GSH-triggered long-distance calcium-mediated
defense response was suppressed in GCaMP3/glr3.3 but nearly

unaffected in GCaMP3/glr3.6 (Fig. 4). Similar to GSH, it was also
observed that Glu depends on GLR3.3 rather than GLR3.6 to initiate the
systemic calcium-based defense signaling (Supplementary Fig. 10).
Considering the recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, which
revealed that GSH and Glu could bind to different domains of GLR3.4
for ion channel activation30, it would be intriguing to investigate
whether GSH binds to GLR3.3 and further determine the potential
relationship between GSH and Glu in activating GLR3.3. Furthermore,
in contrast to GSH and Glu, the recently identiﬁed Ricca’s factor TGGs,
was shown to rely on both GLR3.6 and GLR3.3 to trigger the systemic
defense response6. It would be exciting to further uncover the signal
interactions among Glu, TGGs, and GSH in wound-induced systemic
defense signaling. Given that various chemical substances have been

eliciting long-distance ionic responses that effectively mediate neu-
rotransmission, identiﬁcation of more systematic signaling molecules
in the future would offer new insights into the complex systemic
defense signaling in plants.
The successful transmission of neural signals from one cell to
another in animals relies on the mutual conversion of chemical signals
(neurotransmitters) and electrical signals, where ion ﬂuxes are induced
by neurotransmitters and the release of neurotransmitters is depen-
dent on electrical signals1,2,42. In contrast, little is known about how
signaling substances are transmitted in plants to activate long-distance
signaling. Previous studies suggest that the dispersal of elicitors such
as Glu may rely on bulk ﬂow and diffusion14. Given that GSH has a
molecular weight similar to that of amino acids, a plausible scenario is
that when plants experience mechanical damage or insect attack, a
large volume of GSH from the intracellular region may surge into the
apoplastic region, inducing calcium inﬂux by activation of the GLR3.3
ion channel. With the action of diffusion and bulk ﬂow of GSH within
the vascular bundles, calcium signals can be rapidly transmitted
between leaves. In addition to the diffusion and bulk ﬂow theory, other
theories have also been proposed, such as the osmoelectric siphon
model, which is based on membrane depolarization leading to cell
water shedding into the apoplast followed by membrane repolariza-
tion and water uptake43. More recently, osmotic pressure has been
suggested to induce the systemic apoplastic release of signaling
molecules like Glu15. Future studies aimed at uncovering the potential
mechanisms underlying GSH-triggered systemic Ca2+ signal transmis-
sion would be fascinating.
Methods
Plant materials and growth condition
hairpin
RNA-52
(hr-52)
was
obtained
from
the
rolling
circle
ampliﬁcation-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library
in our previous study19,20. pad2-1 was ordered from the Nottingham
Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC). Seeds of GCaMP3 were from Simon
Gilroy (Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin). The GCaMP3/
pad2-1 was generated by genetic crosses using standard procedures.
GCaMP3/glr3.3 and GCaMP3/glr3.6 mutants were generated by CRISPR/
Cas9 in WT plants overexpressing GCaMP3. To generate the transgenic
plant expressing 35S::PAD2-6myc/pad2-1 (PAD2/pad2-1), the coding
sequence of PAD2 (AT4G23100) was cloned into the binary vector
pCAMBIA1300, and then transformed into pad2-1.
Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with 20% bleach, sown on agar
plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. After incuba-
tion in the dark at 4 °C for 2 days, plates were cultivated in a growth
chamber at 22 °C with a 16 h/8 h light/dark (long day, LD) photoperiod.
After 7 days, seedlings were then transplanted into soil and grown
under the same condition. For insect feeding and pathogen inocula-
tion assays, plants were grown in soil for 4–5 weeks at 22 °C with a 10 h/
14 h light/dark (short day, SD) photoperiod. For real-time calcium
imaging assay, plates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 days in the dark and
then transferred to 22 °C with a SD photoperiod for 6–7 days. Seed-
lings were then transferred onto new plates and grown for additional
14–16 days prior to use.
Real-time [Ca2+]cyt imaging in the entire plant
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants stably expressing GCaMP3 were imaged
with a motorized epiﬂuorescence (SZX10, Olympus) stereomicroscope
equipped with a 1 × objective lens and a C13440 digital camera (ORCA-
Flash4.0 V3, Hamamatsu Photonics). The GFP-based Ca2+ indicator
GCaMP3 was excited using mercury lamp (X-Cite 120 Q, Excelitas). The
green ﬂuorescent signal was acquired every 2 s with the C13440 cam-
era using Standard imaging software (Olympus).
Using ImageJ software, GCaMP3 signals were analyzed overtime at
regions of interest (ROI). The equation ΔF/F0 = (F-F0)/F0 was used to
calculate the fractional ﬂuorescence changes. F0 denotes the average
baseline ﬂuorescence determined by the average of F over the frames
of the recording before treatment. The entire leaf area was selected as
ROI for Ca2+ signal analysis.
Application of amino acids, tripeptides and chemical agents
GSH, Glu-Pro-Ala, L-Glu, and sorbitol were dissolved in growth medium
[1/2 × MS salts, 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.05% (w/v) MES], which was then
adjusted to pH 5.1. 5 μL of the solution was applied to the cut edge of
leaf 1 after 30 min recovery period after pre-cutting for assessment of
small molecules-induced Ca2+ signal transmission. In contrast, a longer
recovery period of 5 h post pre-cutting was required for the assess-
ment of small molecules-activated gene expression levels. GSH at
concentrations of 0.001 mM, 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM,
25 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM, which are within or exceeding its phy-
siological concentrations, were selected for analyzing GSH-triggered
systemic calcium-based defense signaling in vitro. GGsTOP (HY-
108467, MCE) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. LaCl3 was
dissolved into 0.05% (v/v) Silwet L-77 in water to make a 50 mM solu-
tion and then 10 μL was applied to a piece of Kiwmwipes placed on a
petiole for at least 30 min prior to adding GSH.
CRISPR/Cas9 vector construction and plant transformation
Egg cell-speciﬁc promoter-controlled CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to
generate glr3.3 and glr3.6 single mutants. CRISPR/Cas9 vector was
constructed according to previous studies44. Target sequence was
selected by CRISPR-PLANT (https://www.genome.arizona.edu/crispr/).
All the vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens
strain GV3101 using electroporation. Arabidopsis plants were trans-
formed using the ﬂoral dip methods. The primers used for cloning are
shown in Supplementary Data 5.
DNA extraction and mutation detection
1–5 mg frozen leaf tissues were used for DNA extraction through SDS
method. The extracted genomic DNA was then used as a template to
amplify the desired fragments in each of the target genes using pri-
mers ﬂanking the target sites. PCR products were directly sequenced
using Sanger method to identify mutation. Superimposed sequence
chromatograms produced by biallelic and heterozygous mutations
were decoded by DSDecode (http://dsdecode.scgene.com/) and
manual analyses.
Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR
TransZol RNA kit (ET101-01, TransGen Biotech) was used to extract
total RNA from Arabidopsis plants according to manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA in a 20 μL
reaction by cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit (AT311-03, TransGen Bio-
tech). qRT-PCR was performed in QuantStudio 3 realtime PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, USA) using ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Low
ROX Premixed) (Q331-02, Vazyme). The 2-ΔΔCt analysis method was
used to calculate the relative expression levels of each sample.
JA and JA-Ile quantiﬁcation in leaf tissues
Metabolite extraction and quantiﬁcation of JA and JA-Ile in leaf tissues
were performed according to previously described methods using AB
Sciex 4500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX,
MA, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC™BEH C18 column
(Waters, Eschborn, Germany) (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm)45. d5-JA was added
to the extraction solvent (isopropanol: formic acid at 99.5: 0.5, v/v) as
internal standard. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was applied in
negative mode with mass transitions (precursor ions/product) as fol-
lowed:
209.12 > 59.01
for
JA,
322.20 > 130.09
for
JA-Ile,
and
214.15 > 62.03 for d5-JA. A 10 min gradient elution program was applied
for target compounds separation with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile
(A) and pure water (B) as mobile phase with a 200 μL/min ﬂow rate.
Then, mass spectra data were processed and calculated using AB

SCIEX analyst software (version 1.6.3, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) with calcu-
lation curves made with standards.
Measurement of endogenous Glu and GSH in Arabidopsis
Leaf tissues were collected and directly ground into powder in liquid
nitrogen. Then, 100 mg of powder was weighed accurately and trans-
ferred into a 2 mL centrifuge tube. 10 µL of stable isotope internal
standard (5 µg/mL 13C2-15N-GSH, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was
added to each sample before extraction. Then, 1.5 mL of extraction
buffer (80% methanol with 0.1% formic acid, v/v) was added, with
vortexing for sample resuspension. After a 15 min centrifugation at
14000 × g, the supernatants were diluted 10 times, and 100 µL was
transferred to sample vials for further detection.
Target compounds were detected with a 6500 plus QTrap mass
spectrometer (AB SCIEX, USA) coupled with a ACQUITY UPLC H-Class
system, equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) probe.
Extracts were separated by a synergi Hydro-RP column (2.0 × 100 mm,
2.5 μm, phenomenex). A binary solvent system was used, in which
mobile phase A consisted of 2 mM Triisobutylamine adjusted with
5 mM acetic acid in 100% water, and mobile phase B of 100% methanol.
An 8 min gradient with ﬂow rate of 500 μL/min was used as follows:
0–1.0 min at 2% B; 1.0-6 min, 5–40% B; 6–7 min, 98% B; 7.1-8 min, 2% B.
Column chamber and sample tray were held at 35 °C and 10 °C,
respectively. Data were acquired in multiple reaction monitor (MRM)
mode with mass transitions (precursor ions/product) as followed:
308.1 > 179.1 for GSH, 147.9 > 83.9 for Glu and 311.0 > 181.9 for
13C2-15N-GSH. The nebulizer gas (Gas1), heater gas (Gas2), and curtain
gas were set at 55, 55, and 35 psi, respectively. The ion spray voltage
was 4500 V in positive mode. The optimal probe temperature was
determined to be 500 °C. Calibration curves of Glu and GSH were
made with standards, and the concentration of GSH was calculated by
internal-standard method with 13C2-15N-GSH as internal standard, while
the concentration of Glu was calculated by external-standard method.
The SCIEX OS software (version 1.6, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) was applied
for metabolite identiﬁcation and concentration calculation.
Insect feeding assay with Spodoptera exigua
S. exigua larvae (2nd instar) were purchased from Jiyuan Baiyun Industry
Co., Ltd (China). For feeding assays, 2nd instar S. exigua larvae were ﬁrst
underwent 24 h of starvation treatment in growth chamber and were
then gently placed on 5 week-old plants. Two S. exigua larvae were
placed on a plant. Larval weights were measured 7 days after feeding.
Representative S. exigua larvae recovered from corresponding plants
were killed by 75% ethanol solution and photographed by stereo-
microscope (SZX10, Olympus) equipped with a 0.75 × objective lens
and a digital camera (SC180, Olympus).
Botrytis cinerea infection assay
Conidiospores were collected from B. cinerea (B0510) plates and
diluted to ~1 × 106 conidiospores/mL in PDB medium (Potato Dextrose
Broth, BD). For drop-inoculation assay, 5 μL B. cinerea spores was
dropped on the center of each detached leaf. Subsequently the
detached leaves were placed in dark with high humidity for 2–3 days.
Phenotypes were imaged with a digital camera and the lesion sizes
were measured using Digimizer software (v3.1.2.0, Belgium, Germany).
For spray-inoculation assay, 4 week-old soil-grown seedlings were
sprayed evenly with B. cinerea conidiospores and kept in high humidity
for 2–3 days. The disease severity was classiﬁed into four grades:
healthy (H, green), light symptoms (L, pale green), severe symptoms
(S, orange-yellow), or completely dead (D, red). PDB buffer served as
mock in these infection assays. As described in previous studies45–47,
the assessment of B. cinerea biomass was determined by real-time PCR
quantiﬁcation of the fungal CUTINASE signal (Z69264) in relation to
Arabidopsis ACTIN2.
RNA sequencing and data analysis
RNA integrity was checked using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the
Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Sequencing
libraries were generated using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit
for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations
and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample.
The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot
Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS
(Illumia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster
generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina
Novaseq platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Low-
quality reads were removed from the raw reads using Cutadapt48 and
Trimmomatic49 software to get clean reads. Clean reads were mapped
to the corresponding reference genome using HISAT2 software50.
Gene expression levels and read count of each gene were calculated
using StringTie software51. The R package DEseq2 (v1.16.1) was used to
identify the differentially expressed genes based on the following cri-
teria: padj < 0.05 and |log2
FoldChange | > 152. Venn diagramming, GO
enrichment analysis was performed using TBtools (v2.007)53.
Structure prediction and molecular docking
The ab initio structure predictions of AtGLR3.3 protein were imple-
mented by RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold 2 through ColabFold54–56. The
homology modelling of AtGLR3.3 was conducted using SWISS-MODEL
with AtGLR3.4 crystallography model (7lzh) template30,57. Ligand mol2
ﬁles of GSH and Glu were generated by Avogadro 1.2.058. Prepdock
website (https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/servers/html/prepdock.html) and
AutoDockTools 1.5.7 software were used for adding hydrogens and
symmetry related waters, computing Gasteiger charges, and detecting
torsion root59. Molecular dockings were performed on AutoDock Vina
1.2.0 software and CB-DOCK2 website60,61. For AutoDock Vina, the grid
box was setting up with a range spacing of 0.897 Å, number of points in
x, y and z dimensions as 52, 54, and 70 respectively and center grid box
for x, y and z as 173.571, 198.031, and 203.573 respectively for the ATD
of AtGLR3.3. Docking of LBD was conducted with 0.756 Å in range
spacing. The number of points in x, y and z dimensions was 60, 56, and
78. The center grid box was 172.151, 160.102, and 157.178 in xyz-
coordinates. The results were visualized and the polar contacts
between ligands and their receptor were detected on PyMOL
2.5.8 software. Hydrogen bonds were determined on UCSF ChimeraX
1.7.1 software with distance tolerance of 0.400 Å and angle tolerance of
20.000°62.
Statistical analysis
All data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0, SPSS,
and R software and presented by Adobe Illustrator. Means and devia-
tions were reported in the Figures and the corresponding ﬁgure
legends.
