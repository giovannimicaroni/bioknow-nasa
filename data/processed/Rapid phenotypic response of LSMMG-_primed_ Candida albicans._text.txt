Abstract 
32 
 
Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the 
33 
gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI 
34 
tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity 
35 
of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the 
36 
context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. 
37 
In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized 
38 
with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and 
39 
reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. 
40 
Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These 
41 
results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference 
42 
in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in 
43 
the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol 
44 
conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, 
45 
C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination 
46 
impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study 
47 
identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a 
48 
role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes. 
49 
Importance 
50 
 
Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is found in the gut of most individuals. C. 
51 
albicans has been shown to contribute to alcoholic liver disease. Outside of this, the impact of 
52 
intestinal fungi on alcohol-use disorder (AUD) had been unstudied. As AUD is a complex 
53 
disorder characterized by high relapse rates, and there are only 3 FDA-approved therapies for 
54 
the maintenance of abstinence, it is important to study novel AUD contributors to find new 
55 
therapeutic targets. Here we show that an intestinal fungus, C. albicans, can alter mammalian 
56 
ethanol consumption through an immune modulator, prostaglandin E2. The results highlight 
57 
novel contributors to AUD-related phenotypes and further implicate the gut-brain axis in AUD. 
58 
Future studies could lead to new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of AUD.  
59 
Introduction 
60 
 
Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of 
61 
roughly 65% of individuals (1). C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause oral 
62 
thrush and life-threatening bloodstream infections (2,3). Because of the severity of these 
63 
infections, C. albicans pathogenesis has been extensively investigated. However, prior to 
64 
infections, C. albicans lives in the gut and can breach the GI tract to infect the host (4–6). 
65 
 
One host setting associated with enrichment for C. albicans in the GI tract is alcohol use 
66 
disorder (AUD), a condition in which individuals have lost the ability to control or stop their 
67 
alcohol consumption (7). Estimates suggest roughly 2.3 billion people in the world consume 
68 
alcohol and over 5% of the world’s adult population has an AUD (8). C. albicans is enriched in 
69 
the fecal microbiome in individuals with AUD (9–11) and contributes to the progression and 
70 
severity of ALD (9,10). Immune responses to intestinal fungi correlate with a reduced 5-year 
71 
.

survival in those with ALD (9), showing that changes in abundance of intestinal fungi have vital 
72 
consequences to the host. 
73 
 
The gut microbiota can also affect host behavior via effects on the gut-brain axis (GBA). 
74 
The GBA is defined as the bidirectional communication between the GI tract and the brain 
75 
(12,13). The GBA has been implicated in many disorders ranging from autism to addiction (14–
76 
17). Initial work characterizing the GBA in AUD found dysbiosis in the GI tract can contribute to 
77 
depression and craving (18). Specific bacteria have been found that contribute to the control of 
78 
factors crucial to alcohol craving (19,20). Further, fecal microbiota transplants in mice and 
79 
humans can modulate ethanol preference and craving respectively (21,22). These findings 
80 
support the model that changes to the microbiome in AUD can regulate ethanol consumption. 
81 
As a mechanism linking microbiome changes to the GBA in AUD, we investigated the 
82 
role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid compound synthesized from arachidonic acid. A 
83 
previous study showed that treatment with PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption in rats (23). 
84 
Serum PGE2 levels have previously been shown to be higher in antibiotic-treated mice with GI 
85 
colonization by C. albicans (24). Further, we previously showed that C. albicans colonization in 
86 
mice dysregulated endocannabinoids (25), another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic 
87 
acid as a precursor (26). The arachidonic acid-derived host lipidome is thus altered in C. 
88 
albicans-colonized mice. We therefore tested for a role for PGE2 in reducing ethanol 
89 
consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice. 
90 
 
In this study, we show that C. albicans GI colonization in mice reduced their ethanol 
91 
consumption. C. albicans-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE2 compared to mock-
92 
colonized mice, and injection of uncolonized mice with dimethyl-PGE2 reduced ethanol 
93 
consumption. The reduction in ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice was reversed 
94 
by antagonizing receptors for PGE2. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited altered expression of 
95 
dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum, a more rapid acquisition of ethanol-induced 
96 
conditioned taste aversion, and were more sensitive to ethanol-induced motor coordination 
97 
deficits which could be reversed by PGE2 receptor antagonist treatment. These results show for 
98 
the first time that changes to the fungal microbiome can alter ethanol preference and ethanol-
99 
induced behavior in mice. 
100 
Results 
101 
C. albicans colonization in female mice reduces ethanol consumption. 
102 
 
Mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans as described (25).We previously showed 
103 
that inoculation did not result in significant changes in bacterial microbiota composition and did 
104 
not evoke significant inflammation (25). Colonized and mock-colonized mice were subjected to 
105 
a continuous access two-bottle choice experiment where mice were given access to two sipper 
106 
tubes containing water or 15% ethanol simultaneously as described in Materials and Methods. 
107 
Ethanol consumption and ethanol preference showed reductions on both days of the protocol in 
108 
C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized mice (mock) (Figures 1A, B). C. 
109 
albicans-colonized mice consumed slightly less total liquid than mock on day 1 and the same 
110 
amount of liquid on day 2. Both groups drank less total liquid than mice only given access to 
111 
.

water (H2O-only) (Figure 1C). Colony forming units/gram of fecal pellets (FP) or cecum 
112 
contents (CC) demonstrated the presence of C. albicans in the GI tract of inoculated mice 
113 
throughout the experiment (Figure 1D). From these results, we concluded that C. albicans 
114 
colonization reduced ethanol consumption in female mice. 
115 
 
Saccharin preference was tested to determine whether C. albicans colonized mice 
116 
showed alterations in preference to other rewarding substances (27). Saccharin preference was 
117 
measured in a similar continuous access two-bottle choice experiment as described in Materials 
118 
and Methods. Saccharin preference per day showed no effect of C. albicans colonization 
119 
(Figure 1E). CFU/gram of FP or CC showed colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 
120 
1F). These results showed that C. albicans colonization did not exert broad effects on 
121 
consumption of all rewarding substances. Rather, the effects were more selective.  
122 
C. albicans-colonized mice have elevated serum PGE2 and PGE2 injection reduces 
123 
murine ethanol preference. 
124 
 
Levels of PGE2 were measured in serum obtained from C. albicans-colonized or mock-
125 
colonized mice following two days of ethanol consumption. Since PGE2 is not a stable molecule, 
126 
concentrations of a metabolite of PGE2, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE2 (PGE-m), commonly 
127 
utilized as a marker for PGE2 (28), were assayed by ELISA. The assay showed that C. albicans-
128 
colonized mice had elevated serum PGE-m levels compared to H2O-only or mock groups 
129 
(Figure 2A).  
130 
To test the effect of elevated PGE2 on ethanol consumption, a 4 day, two-bottle choice 
131 
experiment was performed in which mice were injected with 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (dm-PGE2), a 
132 
commonly-used, stable derivative of PGE2 (29). Mice received either vehicle or one of four 
133 
different concentrations of dm-PGE2 (25, 50, 100, 300 ug/kg) by subcutaneous injection each 
134 
day. Lower concentrations (25 or 50 ug/kg) of dm-PGE2 led to low-level decreases in ethanol 
135 
preference and consumption, and higher concentrations led to larger decreases compared to 
136 
PBS-injected mice (Figures 2B, C). Thus, dm-PGE2 injection in mice decreased ethanol 
137 
consumption in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the model that elevation of endogenous 
138 
PGE2 results in decreased ethanol consumption. 
139 
EP Receptor Antagonism Increases Ethanol Consumption and Preference to Mock-
140 
Colonized Levels. 
141 
Based on these results, we hypothesized that PGE2 is a key driver of reduced ethanol 
142 
preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. To test this hypothesis, female mice were orally 
143 
inoculated with C. albicans or mock-colonized with PBS and injected with 2 g/kg each of an EP1 
144 
antagonist (SC-51089, Cayman Chemical) and an EP2 antagonist (TG6-10-1, Cayman 
145 
Chemical) subcutaneously each day of the 2 day two-bottle choice experiment. Mock-colonized 
146 
mice injected with vehicle or antagonist showed no difference in ethanol consumption or 
147 
preference (Figure 3A,B). Mice that were colonized with C. albicans and injected with vehicle 
148 
showed significantly lower ethanol consumption and preference compared to other groups. 
149 
Those injected with antagonists showed significantly higher ethanol consumption and 
150 
preference on day 1 and a trend towards an increase in ethanol consumption on day 2. Some

reductions in total liquid consumed in C. albicans-colonized, vehicle-injected mice were 
152 
observed (Figure 3C). Mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 3D).  
153 
 
We also tested whether male mice had a reduction in ethanol consumption following C. 
154 
albicans colonization and whether this phenotype could be reversed by EP antagonists. A trend 
155 
towards reduction in ethanol consumption by the vehicle injected, C. albicans-colonized mice 
156 
was observed on day 2 of ethanol consumption, and total liquid-consumed was also reduced 
157 
(Figures 3E,F,G). These mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment (Figure 3H). 
158 
These results support the model that activation of EP1/EP2 receptors in C. albicans-colonized 
159 
mice decreases their ethanol consumption and preference. Further experiments were 
160 
conducted with females only since females showed strong effects of colonization.  
161 
Increased Serum PGE2 in C. albicans-colonized Mice Correlates with Gene Expression in 
162 
the Brain. 
163 
We next tested the hypothesis that C. albicans gut colonization and elevation of PGE2 
164 
concentration would result in transcriptomic changes in the brain. PGE2 binds to its cognate 
165 
receptors encoded by four different genes, Ep1, Ep2, Ep3, and Ep4(30). PGE2 has been shown 
166 
to upregulate expression of Ep receptor genes in a dose dependent manner in neuronal cell 
167 
lines and various tissues in the body(31,32). We decided to focus on a region of the brain 
168 
involved in habit formation, the dorsal striatum (DS) (33), as well as other addiction-implicated 
169 
regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)(34).  
170 
To test the hypothesis, RT-qPCR from DS-cDNA was performed and expression of Ep1 
171 
and Ep2 relative mock-colonized from the same experimental trial was measured. There were 
172 
no significant differences in Ep receptor expression between groups in the DS, PFC, or NAc 
173 
(Figure S1). However, correlations between PGE-m concentration in the serum and relative 
174 
expression of Ep1 or Ep2 in the same C. albicans-colonized mouse were observed. Gene 
175 
expression relative to the average for mock-colonized was plotted against the concentration of 
176 
PGE-m (also standardized to mock-colonized). Figure 4A,B demonstrates that mice with higher 
177 
concentrations of serum PGE2 exhibited higher expression of Ep1 and Ep2. In mock-colonized 
178 
mice, there were no significant correlations (Figure 4C,D). We observed similar significant 
179 
correlations of Ep1 expression and PGE-m concentration in the PFC and NAc (Figure S2). 
180 
Elevated PGE2 levels were thus associated with higher expression of Ep receptors in multiple 
181 
regions of the brain. 
182 
We also analyzed the expression of dopamine receptors in the DS of these mice. The 
183 
dopamine system in the DS is commonly involved with learning and habit formation (35). 
184 
Expression of two main classes of dopamine receptors, Drd1 and Drd2, was measured (36). A 
185 
trend towards a reduction in Drd1 expression and a statistically significant reduction in Drd2 
186 
expression in C. albicans-colonized mice compared to mock-colonized were observed (Figure 
187 
5A). Additionally, mice injected with low-dose dm-PGE2 (25 or 50ug/kg injections) showed 
188 
reduced expression of Drd1 and Drd2 (Figure 5B). Interestingly, Drds showed no differences in 
189 
expression in the PFC or NAc (Figure S3). Furthermore, other addiction-related genes showed 
190 
no significant differences in expression in the DS (Figure S4). These results show that both C.

albicans colonization and low-dose dm-PGE2 injections reduce dopamine receptor expression in 
192 
the DS. 
193 
Expression of Drd1 or Drd2 in mock or C. albicans-colonized mice correlated with total 
194 
ethanol consumed. In the dorsal striatum, DRD1 is involved with reward formation and DRD2 is 
195 
involved with aversion formation (37). Plots of Drd expression and total ethanol consumed 
196 
showed a significant positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol 
197 
consumption in mock-colonized mice (Figure 6A) and a trend towards a positive correlation 
198 
between Drd2 and total ethanol consumed (Figure 6C). In C. albicans-colonized mice, by 
199 
contrast, a significant negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol 
200 
consumption was observed (figure 6D). No correlation between Drd1 expression and total 
201 
ethanol consumed was observed in these mice (Figure 6B). Thus, C. albicans-colonized mice 
202 
that consumed lower amounts of ethanol exhibited higher expression of the aversion-associated 
203 
DRD2 receptor.  
204 
Candida albicans colonization accelerates the onset of conditioned taste aversion in 
205 
mice. 
206 
 
Based on the low ethanol consumption and negative correlation between Drd2 
207 
expression and ethanol consumption in C. albicans-colonized mice, we hypothesized that these 
208 
mice would show enhanced ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Ethanol-induced 
209 
CTA is based on the principle that mice will develop an aversion to a novel tasting solution when 
210 
it is paired with an ethanol injection (38,39). Mice were tested for ethanol-induced CTA as 
211 
described in Materials and Methods.  
212 
The first exposure to the tastant showed the baseline consumption level, prior to 
213 
injection (conditioning) with ethanol or control (sterile saline). Trials 2-4 showed consumption 
214 
after conditioning, expressed as the change from initial consumption (Figure 7A). In trial 2, 
215 
control mice showed similar or higher than baseline consumption of the tastant. Both mock-
216 
colonized and C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 3g/kg ethanol developed a near 
217 
complete aversion to the tastant (100% reduction), which continued through trials 3 and 4. In 
218 
contrast, mice given a lower concentration of ethanol (2g/kg) showed differences between 
219 
groups. There was no significant aversion in the mock-colonized mice in trial 2 of this injection 
220 
group and C. albicans-colonized mice showed a significant reduction in saline consumption 
221 
compared to control mice in trial 2. On trial 3, both mock-colonized and C. albicans-colonized 
222 
mice injected with 2g/kg ethanol showed significant aversion to the tastant. There were no 
223 
differences in colonization or mouse weight throughout the experiment (Figure 7B, S5). C. 
224 
albicans-colonized mice thus developed ethanol-induced CTA more rapidly.  
225 
C. albicans-colonized mice are more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol and 
226 
motor coordination deficits can be restored by EP receptor antagonism. 
227 
 
The more rapid development of ethanol-induced CTA in C. albicans-colonized mice 
228 
suggests these mice could be more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol as 
229 
correlations between these phenotypes have been observed (40). Therefore, we tested whether 
230 
C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol sedation, ethanol-induced motor 
231 
coordination defects, and depressant effects of ethanol (Figure 8A).

The first experiment was the open field activity test (OFT), which measures how 
233 
susceptible C57BL/6 mice are to the depressant effects of alcohol based on the decrease in 
234 
distance traveled in the OFT following ethanol injection (1.5 g/kg) (41). Mice were injected with 
235 
ethanol (dose) or control (sterile saline [SS]) and distance traveled in 10 minutes in the OFT 
236 
was measured. Results are expressed relative to the SS-injected mice within each experimental 
237 
trial (mock or C. albicans-colonized) (Figure 8B). Results showed a significant reduction in 
238 
distance traveled by C. albicans-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to C. albicans-
239 
colonized, SS-injected mice. There was not a significant reduction in distance traveled by the 
240 
mock-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to SS-injected mice. These results show that 
241 
the C. albicans-colonized mice were more strongly affected by ethanol.  
242 
The loss of righting reflex (LORR) experiment tested the ability of mice to right 
243 
themselves after injection with a sedative amount of ethanol (3.5 g/kg) (42). The time for the 
244 
mice to lose their righting reflex after the injection is termed LORR onset. Mock or C. albicans-
245 
colonized mice that had received SS injections the previous three days, or mock mice that 
246 
received ethanol the previous 3 days had no differences in LORR onset (Figure 8C). C. 
247 
albicans-colonized mice that received ethanol injections on the previous 3 days showed a 
248 
significantly shorter LORR onset compared to all groups. Blood ethanol concentration from 
249 
serum collected at the time of loss of righting reflex showed a trend towards higher levels in 
250 
these mice (Figure 8D). These results indicate a synergistic effect of ethanol treatment 
251 
(including prior treatment) and C. albicans-colonization that increased the sedative effects of 
252 
ethanol. 
253 
Motor coordination defects were tested using performance on the balance beam, which 
254 
can measure coordination based on the number of slips and falls on the beam (43). Mice were 
255 
injected with SS or ethanol and their performance was assessed. The total number of slips or 
256 
falls throughout three trials (Figure 8E) and the total amount of time required to complete three 
257 
trials were measured (figure 8F). Mock-colonized or C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 
258 
SS did not slip/fall often and completed the trials quickly. Mock-colonized mice injected with 
259 
ethanol showed a significant increase in slips and falls, consistent with ethanol-induced motor 
260 
coordination deficits. C. albicans-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed significantly more 
261 
slips and falls than any of the other groups and were significantly slower. Furthermore, there 
262 
were no differences in colonization or mouse weight in these experiments (Figure S6). Thus, C. 
263 
albicans-colonized mice showed more ethanol-induced impairment in motor coordination. 
264 
To test the hypothesis that PGE2 signaling contributed to the differences in mouse 
265 
susceptibility to the effects of ethanol, mice were injected with the combination of EP1 and EP2 
266 
antagonists (2mg/kg each) before each behavioral test. Total slips and falls on the balance 
267 
beam test following these injections was measured. C. albicans-colonized mice injected with 
268 
ethanol and antagonists showed a significant decrease in slips and falls compared to the 
269 
ethanol and vehicle group (Figure 8G). There was no difference between the C. albicans-
270 
colonized group with ethanol and antagonists compared to either of the mock + ethanol injected 
271 
groups. We did not see a similar reversal of phenotypes by antagonists in either the OFT or 
272 
LORR (Figure S7). These results showed that blocking PGE2 signaling in C. albicans-colonized 
273 
mice reduced their susceptibility to ethanol-induced impairment of motor control.

Taken together, the results showed that C. albicans-colonized mice were more 
275 
susceptible to the depressant and sedative effects of ethanol, and to ethanol-induced 
276 
impairment in motor control. PGE2 effects on EP1 and EP2 receptors make a major contribution 
277 
to the mechanism of ethanol-induced motor impairment.

We demonstrate that C. albicans-colonization in mice reduces ethanol preference and 
280 
consumption. Our results with EP1/EP2 antagonists show that PGE2 signaling plays a 
281 
significant role in modifying mouse ethanol preference. Further, injection of uncolonized mice 
282 
with dm-PGE2 reduced ethanol consumption. There was a somewhat dose-dependent response 
283 
as low concentrations of dm-PGE2 (25-50 ug/kg) reduced consumption moderately and higher 
284 
doses of dm-PGE2 (100-300ug/kg) reduced ethanol preference and consumption more strongly.  
285 
Antibiotic treated mice with C. albicans gut colonization have been previously shown to 
286 
exhibit elevated serum PGE-m levels (24). Mice treated with antibiotics but not inoculated with 
287 
fungi showed a modest increase in serum PGE-m levels and this level was sufficient to promote 
288 
inflammatory cell responses. C. albicans-colonized mice in our study, which did not use 
289 
antibiotics, also showed modestly increased serum concentrations of PGE-m and PGE-m 
290 
concentration correlated with ethanol preference. These results indicate that modest increases 
291 
in serum PGE2 are associated with changes in host immune responses and behavior. PGE2 in 
292 
circulation may be directly involved in these changes or may serve as a marker indicating higher 
293 
levels of PGE2 in multiple organs. In fact, we saw evidence of increased PGE2 by correlations 
294 
with Ep expression in all regions of the brain examined. 
295 
PGE2 has previously been shown to alter the permeability of the blood brain barrier 
296 
(BBB) by inducing alterations in endothelial permeability or by stimulating the retraction of 
297 
pericytes from the surface of the BBB (44–46). PGE2 has also been shown to induce 
298 
vasodilation (44). Vasodilatory effects and BBB alterations could lead to higher amounts of 
299 
PGE2 in the brain and reduce ethanol consumption. These results support the model that, as 
300 
PGE2 in the circulation elevates above normal fluctuating ranges, BBB permeability increases, 
301 
and more PGE2 can enter the brain, resulting in correlations between its concentration in serum 
302 
and Ep1/Ep2 receptor expression in C. albicans-colonized mice. 
303 
Synergy between the effects of C. albicans colonization and the effects of ethanol were 
304 
also observed. Mice that received both ethanol and C. albicans were the only group with 
305 
significantly reduced locomotion in the OFT. C. albicans-colonized mice that received multiple 
306 
injections with ethanol showed significantly shorter time to LORR onset than C. albicans-
307 
colonized mice that received one injection. Ethanol also affects the BBB through changes in 
308 
integrity and permeability (47,48). Inflammatory molecules such as LPS can also synergistically 
309 
increase BBB permeability (49). The effects of ethanol on the BBB may thus synergize with the 
310 
effects of PGE2, resulting in significant behavioral effects in colonized mice. Saccharin 
311 
preference may not be reduced by C. albicans colonization because of the lack of an additional 
312 
insult to the BBB.

PGE2 has previously been shown to affect the dopamine system. Dopamine is critical for 
314 
habit, reward, and aversion formation (50). PGE2 treatment altered reward learning to morphine 
315 
in mice (51,52), and has been shown to alter DRD signaling and behavior following cocaine 
316 
ingestion (53). We observed that C. albicans-colonized mice showed altered expression of 
317 
dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum. Expression of one of the receptors, Drd2, was 
318 
significantly decreased in C. albicans colonized mice and low-dose dm-PGE2-injected mice. 
319 
Interestingly, expression in the PFC and NAc did not indicate similar changes to the dopamine 
320 
system, and other genes implicated in addiction such as neuropeptide Y receptors, opioid 
321 
receptors (Mu and Delta), proopiomelanocortin (Pomc), and Fos were unchanged. Significant 
322 
expression differences of the Mu opioid receptor between mock and C. albicans-colonized mice 
323 
appeared to be due to differences in ethanol consumption. These results indicate an altered 
324 
regulation of the dopamine system in the DS observed in mice with low level increases in 
325 
systemic PGE2 concentrations.  
326 
Furthermore, when Drd expression in the DS was plotted against total ethanol 
327 
consumption, significant positive or negative correlations were observed. DRD1 and DRD2 
328 
receptors in the dorsal striatum have well defined, consistent roles. DRD1 signaling in the DS is 
329 
mostly involved with reinforcement or reward learning and DRD2 is most commonly involved 
330 
with aversion-formation (37). A positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol 
331 
consumption was observed in mock-colonized mice, but not in C. albicans-colonized mice 
332 
suggesting dysregulation of the relationship of DRD1/reinforcement in these mice. Additionally, 
333 
a negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption in C. albicans-
334 
colonized mice suggested that aversion to ethanol could develop. Therefore, there could be a 
335 
lack of reinforcement learning, an active aversion, or a combination of both, that leads to lower 
336 
ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. Results from the CTA suggest an aversion-
337 
dominated phenotype because colonized mice showed a more rapid acquisition of conditioned 
338 
taste aversion. These findings support the conclusion that aversion to ethanol develops more 
339 
readily in C. albicans-colonized mice.  
340 
When conducting other behavioral tests, we found that C. albicans-colonized mice 
341 
injected with ethanol showed increased LORR onset, decreased locomotion in the open field 
342 
test (OFT), and further impaired performance on the balance beam. The performance on the 
343 
balance beam could be restored to mock-colonized performance by EP1/EP2 antagonists. 
344 
These results suggest that PGE2 impact on EP1 and EP2 receptors could contribute to motor 
345 
control following ethanol intoxication. The depressant and sedative effects of ethanol detected in 
346 
the OFT and LORR tests could be driven by other systems impacted by C. albicans colonization 
347 
such as the endocannabinoid system (ECS) (25). Both therapeutic manipulation and gene 
348 
knockouts of the ECS modulated LORR and OFT phenotypes (54–56). Effects of C. albicans 
349 
colonization on this pathway (25) could play a role in these phenotypes. 
350 
All of the experiments described in this communication were done with ethanol naïve 
351 
mice. The effects of C. albicans colonization on mice chronically exposed to ethanol are 
352 
currently unknown. There could be an altered effect of C. albicans-colonization on the host in 
353 
the setting of AUD and/or chronic stress. Low DRD2 receptor abundance has been shown in 
354 
individuals with AUD and predisposes mice to stress-induced increases in ethanol consumption 
355 
.

(57,58). If DRD2 receptor abundance is reduced in humans with C. albicans colonization, as it is 
356 
in colonized mice, these individuals may consume more ethanol under stress, possibly 
357 
exacerbating ethanol consumption in AUD. However, our study focused only on initial alcohol 
358 
consumption and these effects of C. albicans colonization in individuals with AUD and/or chronic 
359 
stress are currently unstudied. This remains an area of important future research. 
360 
 
In summary, we have shown that GI colonization by C. albicans elevates serum PGE2 
361 
and these changes correlate with changes in Ep and Drd receptor expression in the dorsal 
362 
striatum. C. albicans colonization decreased ethanol consumption and preference in C57BL/6 
363 
mice. These decreases in ethanol consumption correlated with changes in dopamine receptor 
364 
expression and C. albicans-colonized mice showed altered behavioral effects of ethanol. In 
365 
conclusion, we show for the first time, that changes in the fungal microbiome can impact host 
366 
ethanol consumption and behavioral responses to ethanol. 
367 
Materials and Methods 
368 
Animals 
369 
Five-week-old female or male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimated to 
370 
the facility and single-housing for 4-5 days with scruffing to acclimate to handling. Mice were 
371 
orally inoculated with C. albicans at different times depending on the experiment. Mice were 
372 
inoculated by pipetting 20uL containing 5x107 cells of C. albicans strain CKY101(59) in 
373 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or PBS only for mock-colonized mice, directly into the mouth 
374 
of the mouse as previously described (25). Mock-colonized mice were given 20uL of PBS 
375 
directly into their mouths. Mice were monitored throughout the experiment for colonization as 
376 
previously described (25). No fungal colonies were observed in mock-colonized mice. 
377 
Mouse weight was measured throughout the experiment. Rarely, if a mouse lost 20% of 
378 
its starting body weight, the mouse was euthanized. On the last day of each experiment, mice 
379 
were anesthetized using the isoflurane drop method and euthanized via decapitation. Blood for 
380 
serum and various organs were harvested for analysis. All mouse experiments were approved 
381 
by the Tufts IACUC and were performed in accordance with IACUC guidelines for care and use 
382 
of laboratory animals. 
383 
Chemicals and Reagents 
384 
 
The EP1 antagonist SC-51089 (Cayman Chemical) and the EP2 antagonist TG6-10-1 
385 
(Cayman Chemical) were resuspended in 2:3:5 mixture of DMSO:sterile water:PEG400. 
386 
Antagonists were resuspended and mixed at a concentration that would yield 2mg/kg of each 
387 
antagonist in 50uL and 50 uL of the mixture was injected intraperitoneally.  
388 
 
Fifteen percent ethanol was prepared for consumption by diluting 95% ethanol (Fisher) 
389 
with tap water. This solution was filter sterilized and added to sipper tubes for the two-bottle 
390 
choice experiment.  
391 
 
16,16-dimethyl Prostaglandin E2 (Cayman Chemical) was dried under a gentle stream of 
392 
nitrogen to evaporate the solvent. It was then resuspended in DMSO and injected into mice 
393 
subcutaneously at a concentration of 25, 50, 100, or 300 ug/kg.

Two-Bottle Choice Ethanol or Saccharin Consumption 
395 
 
During acclimation to the facility and single housing, mice also began acclimating to the 
396 
sipper tubes used in the two-bottle choice experiment. Briefly, sterile acidified water was poured 
397 
into 50 mL conical tubes (USA Scientific) and a sterile stopper (#6 Rubber, Ancare) with a sipper 
398 
spout (Ancare) was placed into the 50 mL conical tube and wrapped with parafilm. Two of these 
399 
sipper bottles with water were placed into standard cages for acclimation. 
400 
 
Following acclimation, mice were weighed and assigned to groups with equal weights. 
401 
Mice were inoculated with C. albicans or mock-inoculated on day -1. On day 0, 15% (vol/vol) 
402 
ethanol or 0.0125% (wt/vol) saccharin replaced one water bottle. Mouse weight and tube weight 
403 
were then measured daily throughout the experiment. Sipper bottles were rotated daily to 
404 
minimize side preference. After 2-4 days of ethanol consumption, mice were euthanized as 
405 
previously described. 
406 
For ethanol preference, results show 26 mice per group from 3 replicate experimental 
407 
trials. For saccharin preference, 14-15 mice per group from 2 experimental trials are shown. 
408 
PGE-m ELISA 
409 
 
Trunk blood from mice was obtained after decapitation, collected in BD blood collection 
410 
tubes (365967, Fisher). Tubes were then centrifuged in an Eppendorf table-top microcentrifuge 
411 
at 10,000g for 10 minutes and serum was stored at -80oC. Serum was assayed with a 
412 
Prostaglandin E Metabolite ELISA Kit (514531, Cayman) after removal of proteins by acetone 
413 
precipitation. PGE-m ELISA was performed using the standard protocol, with derivatization, 
414 
detailed in the product manual.  Serum was diluted 15-25 times for the assay and OD was 
415 
measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader. A four parameter logistic curve was determined and 
416 
raw PGE-m values were determined using the 4PL calculator by AAT Bioquest (60).  
417 
Brain Dissection, RT-qPCR, and Primers 
418 
 
Mouse brains were dissected, flash frozen on aluminum foil chilled with dry ice and kept 
419 
at -80°C. A brain matrix (ZIVIC Instruments, 5325) was allowed to chill on ice for 30 minutes. 2 
420 
mm sections of the brain from directly anterior of the cerebellum to the frontal pole were then cut 
421 
using clean straight razor blades and the brain matrix. Sections were then observed to find 
422 
landmarks indicating the location of the dorsal striatum as previously described (61). The dorsal 
423 
striatum was dissected and RNA was extracted as previously described (25). 
424 
 
cDNA was then synthesized using random hexamer primers and RT-qPCR was 
425 
performed as previously described (25). Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S1.  
426 
 
427 
Ethanol-Induced Conditioned Taste Aversion 
428 
 
Following arrival, mice were acclimated to single-housing and sipper tubes by placing 
429 
one sipper tube of water in their cages. Mice were weighed every other day to ensure they were 
430 
consuming enough water to maintain their weight. The following protocol was adapted from a 
431 
previous protocol that showed significant conditioned taste aversion in C57BL/6 mice (62). The

first four days mice were acclimated to sipper tubes and single housing. Then, mice were 
433 
subjected to 5 days of water restriction with only two hours of access to water for two hours 
434 
daily (termed days 1-5 of the experiment). On day 5 of water restriction, mice were inoculated 
435 
with C. albicans or PBS for mock-colonization and were re-inoculated every two days (days 
436 
5,7,9,11). On day 6, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and 
437 
injected with sterile saline, 2g/kg of ethanol, or 3g/kg of ethanol (20% vol/vol) immediately after 
438 
the end of the 1-hour period. Five hours later, mice were given access to water for 30 minutes to 
439 
rehydrate. This process was repeated for days 8 and 10; on day 12, mice were given access to 
440 
1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and then euthanized. Fecal pellets were collected for 
441 
CFU determination on days 6, 8, 10, and cecum contents were collected on day 12. Data were 
442 
analyzed as a percentage of saline consumption compared to the initial amount consumed on 
443 
day 6. 
444 
Open Field Activity Test 
445 
 
On the open field test (OFT) habituation day, mice were injected an average of 15 
446 
minutes before their respective trials with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally with an insulin 
447 
syringe. Following 15 minutes, mice were gently placed in the center of a 37cm X 37cm plastic 
448 
open field box. Mice were allowed to roam freely for 10 minutes and removed from the 
449 
apparatus. The apparatus was then sterilized using 70% ethanol. This protocol was repeated for 
450 
every mouse. 
451 
 
On OFT test day, mice were injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol or sterile saline 
452 
intraperitoneally an average of 15 minutes before their trials. The volume of injection varied from 
453 
approximately 90-110uL depending on the weight of the mouse. The ethanol concentration was 
454 
adjusted so that a mouse of average weight for the group would be injected with 100uL ethanol 
455 
solution. The 10-minute test run and cleaning of the apparatus were repeated as above for 
456 
every mouse. Mouse behavior was recorded using a web camera. Scoring videos was 
457 
performed using EthovisionXT software to automatically determine distance traveled. Total 
458 
distance traveled was plotted relative to the mean of the sterile saline group distance traveled. 
459 
Balance Beam 
460 
 
A balance beam apparatus was constructed using a square 0.25-inch diameter, 3-foot-
461 
long metal rod held approximately 1.5ft above the surface. A plastic box to hold bedding was 
462 
affixed to one end to provide incentive for the mouse to cross the entirety of the balance beam. 
463 
A reading lamp shining on the start zone of the beam was used as an aversive stimulus. Start 
464 
and end points for the balance beam trials spanning 65 cm of the beam were marked.  
465 
 
On habituation day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally 
466 
approximately 15 minutes before the start of their first of 3 trials. Mice were then placed in the 
467 
start zone to begin trial 1. After completing the trial, mice were given 30 seconds of rest in their 
468 
home cage before the start of trial 2. Trials 2 and 3 were performed by the same procedure. 
469 
After a mouse completed 3 trials, the balance beam was cleaned using 70% ethanol and the 
470 
next mouse was tested. In the event that a mouse would freeze, or very rarely fall, they would 
471 
be gently prodded or placed back on the bar until they completed the trial. All mice within a 
472 
cohort underwent this procedure.

On test day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline or injected with 1.5g/kg of 
474 
ethanol as described in the open field activity test section. These injections were performed 
475 
approximately 15 minutes before the start of the first trial. A web camera was used to record 
476 
mouse behavior during these trials. The 3 trials were repeated as described above. All mice 
477 
completed the entirety of the 3 trials. 
478 
Videos were blinded for scoring. Start and stop times were determined when the 
479 
mouse’s nose crossed designated marks on the bar. A slip was determined when a mouse’s foot 
480 
slipped below the bar or a significant slip from a standing position on the bar to the pelvis 
481 
touching the bar occurred. A fall was scored when the mouse slipped to the underside of the 
482 
bar. Very rarely a mouse would fall from the bar into safety padding below the bar. Both of these 
483 
events were scored equally as falls. Time or slips and falls were summed for all 3 trials for each 
484 
mouse. 
485 
Loss of Righting Reflex 
486 
 
Mice were co-housed with another mouse within the same group for the LORR. Their 
487 
nestlet was removed for the test. Mice were injected with 3.5g/kg of ethanol intraperitoneally 
488 
and the time of injection was recorded. Within roughly 1-2 minutes most mice lost righting reflex 
489 
which was defined as an inability to right themselves when lying on their back in a V-shaped 
490 
plastic trough. The time when a mouse lost righting reflex was designated the LORR onset. Six 
491 
minutes after injection, mice were given one minute of exposure to isoflurane via the drop 
492 
method and euthanized as above. Occasionally, a mouse would have to be removed from the 
493 
data due to shearing of an artery during injection—significantly altering LORR time. 
494 
Blood Ethanol Concentration Assay 
495 
 
Following LORR, trunk blood was collected and serum was extracted as previously 
496 
described in the PGE-m ELISA section. For the blood ethanol concentration determination, an 
497 
EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (ECET-100, BioAssay Systems) was used. Standard protocols 
498 
were followed for the determination using serum that was diluted 15X. OD was measured on a 
499 
Biotek Epoch2 plate reader.

Figure 1: C. albicans-colonized mice consume significantly less ethanol and have lower 
698 
ethanol preference than mock-colonized mice Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were 
699 
orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS. After inoculation, mice were subjected 
700 
to a 2-bottle choice experiment, with one bottle of 15% ethanol (vol/vol) and one bottle of water. 
701 
Liquid consumption was measured by weighing the bottles daily. (A) Ethanol consumption (gm 
702 
ethanol/kg body weight) on the first and second day of access to ethanol.  Mock-colonized
