The Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) 
and international astronaut biobank
Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and 
poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming 
increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space1–6. Yet current frameworks 
for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision 
medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine 
databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas 
(SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic 
research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, 
JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA 
resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space 
omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine 
Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles 
encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics 
and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, 
including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well 
as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific 
mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to 
accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk 
mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration- 
class missions.
With an exponential increase in launches since 2019, space is rapidly 
becoming more accessible1. Multiple commercial and state-sponsored 
groups are developing roadmaps to construct space stations, moon 
bases, Mars colonies and other permanent establishments beyond 
Earth1. Although innovation across the aerospace sector makes these 
ambitions technologically achievable, the biomedical challenges for 
crews in these extraplanetary habitats still need to be addressed, as 
humans did not evolve to survive in such extreme environments. The 
clinical consequences of this evolutionary mismatch of spaceflight 
exposure and adaptation have revealed a plethora of challenges to 
long-term space habitation, including a loss in bone density and mus-
cle mass2, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome3, perturbed 
immune function4 and spaceflight anaemia5. These physiological 
changes during spaceflight appear to imprint on the health status in 
humans; a chief example of this long-term effect is the increased risk 
of cardiovascular pathology observed in astronauts compared with 
age-matched controls6.
Before long-term space habitation is feasible, these biomedical chal-
lenges must be understood and mitigated. However, the aetiologies 
driving them are not understood, with the low number of astronauts 
yielding limited opportunities for in-depth biomolecular characteriza-
tion. For example, two of the largest multi-omic studies to date have 
been the NASA Twins Study, which has published an in-depth molecular 
and cognitive profile of a single astronaut7, and the Japanese Aero-
space Exploration Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) project, 
which has profiled cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cfRNA in six astronauts8,9. 
Thus, achieving statistical power requires integrating data from other 
cohorts, such as the MARROW study, and other missions5,10. Further-
more, these analyses are complicated by the substantial variation in 
physiological responses to spaceflight among astronauts. Therefore, 
there is a need for increasingly large, detailed multi-omic profiles of 
astronauts to characterize the diversity of physiological shifts as a 
function of spaceflight11.
To achieve this end, we have leveraged the burgeoning commercial 
spaceflight industry. With the launch of SpaceX’s 2021 Inspiration4 (I4) 
mission, a cohort of all-civilian astronauts successfully completed a 
high elevation (585 km), 3-day orbital mission within a SpaceX Dragon 
capsule. Using recently developed protocols, the crew participated in 
a range of biospecimen collections before, during and after their mis-
sion12. We used the I4 biospecimens to deeply profile the effect of the 
stressors of spaceflight (for example, microgravity and space radiation) 
on crew physiology and health. We also compared these results with 
previous missions and control datasets, creating the largest-to-date 
molecular atlas of the effect of spaceflight on the human body, encom-
passing almost 3,000 samples and over 75 billion sequenced nucleic 
acids. Collectively, these resources are referred to as SOMA, and the 
samples are linked to a Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank (CAMbank) 
that stores viably frozen specimens for future, additional analyses.
As with Earth-based cohorts13, these accessible data — when pro-
filed and aggregated at scale — will enable the development of both 
personalized and general medical guidance for astronauts14. A large 
group of subject matter experts in artificial intelligence has recently 
released recommendations focused on the importance of generating 
and archiving space data into the NASA Open Science Data Repository

(OSDR)15,16 to enable autonomous and intelligent precision space health 
systems, and to monitor, aggregate and assess biomedical statuses 
for future deep space missions17. In addition, the study of the parallels 
between the physiological effects of spaceflight and ageing, chronic 
disease and immune system disorders using omics data can pave the 
way for therapeutics applicable to conditions on Earth.
Here we present a detailed guide to the SOMA resource, which 
includes the 2,911 samples collected during the I4 mission11,12, as well 
as spatial transcriptomics data, long-read profiles of astronaut RNA, 
microbiome data, exosome profiles and in-depth immune diversity 
maps. Additional spaceflight data were annotated and compiled into 
the SOMA portal to help contextualize gene, protein or metabolite 
dynamics, including data from the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA’s CFE 
mission8,9, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data after simu-
lated microgravity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)18, 
and rat or mouse spaceflight data matched to human orthologues. In 
addition to rigorous dataset annotations, we detail (1) a comparison 
of conclusions on NASA Twins Study and flight dynamics comparing 
short-duration and long-duration missions, (2) cell-type-specific 
responses to spaceflight previously undocumented in astronauts, 
(3) cfRNA expression profiles showing haematological responses 
during recovery from spaceflight, and (4) additional analyses on 
individual responses to spaceflight from proteomic, transcriptomic 
and microbiome data. Data and samples generated in this study are 
available through SOMA (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu), NASA OSDR 
(https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) and CAMbank (https://cambank.weill.
cornell.edu/), which offer an unprecedented view of the multi-system 
omics changes before, during and after spaceflight.
Comprehensive astronaut data resource
To generate a comprehensive profile of the physiological changes of 
the I4 crew (29, 38, 42 and 51 years of age), 13 biospecimen sample types 
were collected and processed, including whole blood, serum, PBMCs, 
plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) derived from plasma, 
dried blood spots, oral swabs, nasal swabs, skin biopsies, skin swabs, 
capsule (SpaceX Dragon) swabs, urine and stool specimens12. After 
collection, samples were subject to a battery of multi-omic assays, 
including clinical (CLIA) whole-genome sequencing, a clonal haema-
topoiesis panel, direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq), single-nucleus RNA-seq 
(snRNA-seq), single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chroma-
tin with sequencing (snATAC-seq), single-cell B cell repertoire (BCR) and 
T cell repertoire (TCR) V(D)J sequencing, untargeted plasma proteom-
ics (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry), untargeted 
plasma metabolomics, cfDNA sequencing, cfRNA, metagenomics, 
metatranscriptomics and spatially resolved transcriptomics. In addi-
tion, chemokine, cytokine and cardiovascular biomarkers were quanti-
fied, and a CLIA lab (Quest Diagnostics) was used to perform a complete 
blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel (Fig. 1a). Datasets 
were generated across ten timepoints: three pre-flight (L−92, L−44 
and L−3), three in-flight (flight day 1 (FD1), FD2 and FD3), one immedi-
ately post-flight (R+1) and three recovery (R+45, R+82 and R+194) span-
ning 289 days (Fig. 1b). Assays were performed on all crew members 
unless otherwise noted (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).
A total of 2,911 samples were banked, with 1,194 samples processed 
for sequencing, imaging and biochemical analysis (Supplementary 
Table 1). These results and assays subsume and expand on work and 
protocols from previous missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the 
NASA Twins Study and some NASA astronauts (Fig. 1c). This latter cat-
egory spans studies primarily from the International Space Station 
(ISS) that lack certain metadata, primarily duration spent in space 
and launch dates, to maintain astronaut anonymity. These studies 
include chemokine/cytokine biomarker panels (n = 46 astronauts), 
comprehensive metabolic panels, telomere length quantitative PCR 
(qPCR) and ISS-surface metagenomic profiling (Fig. 1c).
The SOMA resources were first compared with the NASA OSDR 
database, which contains all publicly accessible human omics data 
from spaceflight and ground analogue studies. OSDR hosts 76 human 
omics studies, of which 11 are from human primary cells exposed to 
spaceflight. The other studies encompassed cell line and ground 
studies, including high-altitude studies (Extended Data Fig. 1a and 
Supplementary Table 2), which were all merged with the SOMA data-
set. Once merged, the total number of sequenced nucleic acid mol-
ecules from this study represents a more than tenfold increase in 
the total amount of human omics data in the OSDR (Extended Data 
Fig. 1b), across all spaceflight studies, ground studies, cell line and 
primary cell experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary 
Tables 2 and 3).
The data from the missions were then divided into three analysis 
timeframes: (1) flight profiles, (2) recovery profiles and (3) longitu-
dinal profiles (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Flight profiles reveal the most 
immediate effect of spaceflight, recovery profiles catalogue changes 
that occur after return to Earth, and the longitudinal profiles identify 
changes that have not returned to baseline after returning to Earth. 
We focused on several outputs for the resource, including first calcu-
lating differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for (1) PBMC snRNA-seq, 
(2) whole-blood dRNA-seq, (3) skin spatially resolved transcriptom-
ics, and (4) cfRNA. We also mapped differentially methylated genes 
from whole-blood dRNA-seq, differentially accessible regions from 
PBMC snATAC-seq, isotype identification from TCR and BCR V(D)J 
sequencing, differentially abundant proteins from plasma and EVP 
proteomics, differential metabolites from liquid chromatography–
mass spectrometry metabolomics, and microbial differentials from 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assays (Extended Data Fig. 2), 
with all raw and processed data annotated in the OSDR (Supplementary 
Table 4).
I4 reproduces NASA Twins Study
Telomere elongation has been previously described in three astronauts 
who stayed for 6 months to 1 year aboard the ISS7,19,20, but it was unclear 
how quickly such a phenotype appeared in astronauts. The average 
telomere length in all I4 crew members increased during spaceflight 
(17–22% longer), and this trend was statistically significant 
(mixed-effects linear model P = 0.0048; Fig. 2a). This finding is par-
ticularly notable, given the shorter mission duration (3 days total) and 
higher elevation of the I4 mission than the ISS studies, indicating that 
telomere length dynamics respond much more rapidly to spaceflight 
than previously observed.
We then compared the DEGs and cytokine changes from the Twins 
Study with those observed in the snRNA-seq data from the I4 mission, 
as well as compared with the expected DEGs of the assay from repli-
cate negative control donor PBMCs (see Methods). The cross-mission 
DEG comparison highlighted a consistent response between both 
types of T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ markers (552 and 608 DEGs, 
respectively, both <2.2 × 10−16), across both sorted T cells or single-cell 
annotated cells (Fig. 2b). Conversely, B cells were less responsive to 
spaceflight, as expected from previous work in the Twins Study7, which 
showed B cells as either not significant or less responsive to spaceflight. 
For the four overlapping cytokines measured in the Twins Study with 
our panel, we found significant increases in three: IL-6 (P = 0.014), IL-10 
(P = 0.021) and CCL2 (P = 0.040) (Fig. 2c); these cytokines also showed 
changes and similar increases in other long-duration (more than 
6 months) crews (Fig. 2c). However, we also ran a differential analysis 
of all cytokines detected on the I4 mission, to detect any differences 
from the Twins Study. Indeed, the levels of BDNF showed a statistically 
significant decrease (P = 0.00011, q = 0.0153), and IL-19 levels showed 
a statistically significant increase (P = 0.00015, q = 0.0153) during the 
post-flight (R+1) timepoint that returned to baseline during recovery 
(R+45 and R+82; Fig. 2d).

Distinct RNA fingerprints of spaceflight
Beyond recapitulating known biomarkers of spaceflight, the atlas inte-
grated newer assays that were not available in previous missions, with a 
particular emphasis on RNA profiling. The first novel assay was spatially 
resolved transcriptomics on skin biopsies, which were obtained from 
all crew members during one pre-flight timepoint (L−44) and the day 
after landing back on Earth (R+1). The 4-mm biopsies were stained 
with markers for DNA, PanCK, FAP and α-SMA and then processed with 
the NanoString/Bruker GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, where regions 
of interest were selected based on the tissue structures identified by 
the fluorescence staining (Extended Data Fig. 3a). After filtering out 
outliers, the RNA counts were used for downstream data analysis, gen-
erating 95 regions of interest across four skin compartments: outer 
epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis and vasculature (Extended 
Data Fig. 3b,c). This analysis revealed a distinct set of DEGs, including 
JAK–STAT signalling, and melanocyte signatures (Fig. 3).
A second RNA assay for spaceflight integrated into SOMA was cfRNA 
profiling, which has recently been established as a dynamic tool for 
mapping temporal alterations in cfRNA composition and cell lysis21. 
However, bulk cfRNA had not been utilized to measure the response 
of spaceflight until the JAXA CFE study8,9 and the I4 mission12. Using 
principal component analysis, we identified a distinct separation in 
cfRNA profiles pre-flight versus post-flight and recovery for I4, sug-
gesting a systemic physiological shift probably induced by space travel 
(Extended Data Fig. 3d). This was further reflected in the differential 
abundance of cfRNA genes across various timepoints, revealing spe-
cific patterns of noncoding expression (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and 
RNA types (Extended Data Fig. 3f) that correspond with the space-
flight timeline. The cell-type proportions inferred from the cfRNA 
profiles also exhibited spaceflight-associated variation over time and 
showed variation distinct from a set of healthy blood donor controls 
(n = 35; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). Cell types that showed 
significant post-flight shifts in proportion included hepatocytes,

kidney endothelial cells, haematopoietic stem cells and melanocytes 
(Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 5). Of note, the melanocyte cell pro-
portions that demonstrated significant changes post-flight (Fig. 3c) 
were also found in the spatial skin transcriptomics data, providing addi-
tional evidence of adaptive skin responses to the space environment.
A third novel RNA method applied to these spaceflight samples 
focused on RNA isoforms and RNA modifications (epitranscriptome), 
through dRNA-seq on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION 
and deep RNA-seq (more than 400 million reads per sample) on the 
Ultima Genomics UG100. These data quantified genes that were dif-
ferentially expressed and displayed differential N6-methyladenosine 
methylation (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), or both, and were analysed 
for enriched Gene Ontology pathways. We identified a set of sites (set 
M-I; Extended Data Fig. 4b) that undergoes hypomethylation during 
recovery, another set (set M-II) that is detectably hypermethylated from 
spaceflight, and a set (set M-III) that exhibits novel hypermethylation 
during recovery and longitudinally as well. The common pathways in 
all three sets (Extended Data Fig. 4b) showed evidence of radiation 
and telomere response, including ‘TSAI response to radiation therapy’ 
and ‘Wiemann telomere shortening’22. In addition, the set of down-
regulated pathways after landing (recovery) was distinct, including 
genes associated with breathing regulation (for example, CO2 and O2 
take-up and release by erythrocytes), which matches those pathways 
associated with crew response ranges (below, Fig. 5). Although further 
studies are needed to validate and delineate the potential mechanisms 
of these RNA dynamics (cfRNA, spatial and RNA modifications), these 
pathways suggest a potential relationship between RNA expression 
and methylation in regulating haematological and dermatological 
functions upon return to Earth.
Gene regulatory changes during recovery
Leveraging the time-series data, we next analysed PBMC gene expres-
sion from snRNA-seq to discern whether unique DEGs are present 
at each timepoint. We examined DEGs from immediately post-flight 
(FP1) through the recovery profiles (RP1 and RP2) to observe how gene 
expression profiles are re-established after spaceflight. The number of 
DEGs was used to quantify the severity and recovery of crew response, 
and we also compared identified DEGs from a negative control group, 
including two healthy donors and read-depth- and cell-count-matched 
permutation group (Extended Data Fig. 5), with an average of more 
than 700 cells per crew member, per timepoint, per cell type. The 
DEG count (adjusted P < 0.05, |log2 fold change (FC)| > 0.5) decreased 
from FP1 to RP1 in CD16+ monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells,

‘other’ T cells (but not CD4+ or CD8+), uncategorized (‘other’) cells and 
in pseudobulk (calculated from additive counts across cell types to 
represent PBMCs). However, the DEG count increased in B cells, CD4+ 
T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 4a); by RP2, all cell types 
had lower DEG counts than at FP1 and began to approach the expected 
noise range of single-cell DEGs (Fig. 4a).
As DEG counts were higher at RP1 than at FP1 for several cell types, 
we hypothesized the introduction of distinct DEGs after landing back 
on Earth. First, we calculated the percentage of DEGs unique to FP1 
at both RP1 and RP2, focusing on cell-type-specific DEGs (Fig. 4b). By 
LP2 (L−92, L−44 and L−3 versus R+82), we observed that nearly all dif-
ferential gene expression was driven by the same set of genes that were 
differentially expressed at FP1, with the exception of CD14+ monocytes, 
which had a unique longitudinal profile not strongly connected with 
the DEG responses in other cells. With the exception of CD14+ mono-
cytes, the RP1 profile is distinct in the abundance of DEGs not present 
in FP1, but this perturbation almost entirely (more than 95% of genes) 
disappeared after flight (RP2 and LP2). From the DEGs shared with FP1, 
we observed that gene expression directionality reversed for nearly 
all DEGs between FP1 and each recovery profile (Fig. 4c), indicating a 
return to baseline for those DEGs. The exception to this were two genes 
from the CD14+ monocyte population — AHR (log2FC of 0.742 (FP1) and 
log2FC of 0.808 (RP1)) and PELI1 (log2FC of 0.539 (FP1) and log2FC of 
0.560 (RP1); Fig. 4c) — in which there was a positive log2FC expression 
at both FP1 and RP1.
From the DEGs that were unique to FP1, we next quantified the 
uniformity of the pathway enrichment between two PBMC lineages: 
T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and monocytes (CD14+ and CD16+; Supple-
mentary Table 6). Of note, 211 (70.8%) genes were unique to individual 
cell types and 87 (29.2%) were shared between two or more cell types 
(Extended Data Fig. 6a). To identify enriched pathways among the 
gene set for each cell type, overrepresentation analysis was performed 
on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways 
(Supplementary Table 6). Even though 70.8% of genes were unique 
to each cell type, their response was more convergent; unique path-
ways only ranged from 4.2% (CD4+ T cells) to 42.5% (CD14+ monocytes; 
Extended Data Fig. 6b). Yet some pathways were cell-type specific, 
such as the circadian entrainment pathway in CD14+ monocytes, 
with genes GNG2, GNAS, PRKCB, CREB1 and CAMK2D driving the 
overrepresentation from the gene set for this pathway (Fig. 4d). In 
addition, our data suggest that overrepresented pathways are some-
times more associated with cell lineage (for example, all T cells) than 
with the individual cell type (for example, CD4). This is evident from 
the longevity-regulating pathway that shares the PRKACB, NFKB1 
and PIK3CA genes between both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations 
(Fig. 4d).
In addition, we found that certain pathways can be enriched across 
specific cell types belonging to different lineages. The inflammatory 
mediator regulation of the ‘TRP channel’ pathway, for example, was 
overrepresented in both CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes, with each

cell type contributing different gene sets associated with the pathway 
(Fig. 4d). Other pathways, such as the IL-17 signalling pathway, con-
tain mixtures of shared genes and unique genes and are significantly 
overrepresented across all cell types (Fig. 4d). This also indicates 
that although cell types are distinct, they appear to have a set of core 
pathways in response to spaceflight, with 30–60% of overrepresented 
pathways shared both within and between lineages (Extended Data 
Fig. 6b).
To examine the chromatin accessibility and regulatory landscape in 
each cell population, we then analysed the transcription factor-binding 
site (TFBS) motif accessibility changes from snATAC-seq data to identify 
the top motifs in flight and recovery profiles (Extended Data Fig. 7). We 
first observed that increased gene expression was correlated with more 
accessibility at the transcription start sites, and closed chromatin was 
associated with downregulated genes (all P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test, for all cell types; Extended Data Fig. 7a). The motif accessibility 
changes associated with recovery profiles recapitulated the trend in 
gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, which showed lower 
accessibility in regions of the genome with closed chromatin and higher 
expression in regions of more accessibility (Extended Data Fig. 7b). In 
addition, we showed the top five upregulated and downregulated TFBS 
motifs per cell type in FP1, RP1 and RP2, which revealed both common 
and distinct motifs and their accessibility across cell types (Extended 
Data Fig. 7c–e). These data also provided further evidence of cell-type 
specificity in the differences of chromatin and transcription factor 
accessibility dynamics.
Intra-individual spaceflight responses
To understand individual variation during spaceflight, the coefficient 
of variation was measured across microbial, proteomic, cytokine and 
gene expression normalized count data, calculated by time interval 
(pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight and recovery). Normalized coefficient 
of variation scores (see Methods) were calculated for each body area 
from the microbial swabs from both metagenomic and metatranscrip-
tomic data. The oral and forearm microbial variation (Extended Data 
Fig. 8a,b) showed Rothia mucilaginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis 
as leading variable strains, but each body site has distinct higher coef-
ficient of variation species (other body sites are shown in Extended 
Data Fig. 8c–j and Supplementary Table 7). Similarly, abundance 
standardized coefficient of variation scores were calculated for EVP 
proteomic, plasma proteomic, metabolomic, RNA-seq, dRNA-seq, and

cytokine abundance normalized protein and gene counts (Extended 
Data Fig. 9a–f). To characterize the participant-to-participant variation 
and null distributions, we also calculated the differentials for FP1 along 
with label permutation testing on these calculations to confirm that 
post-flight coefficient of variation was not higher than other timepoints 
(see Methods; Supplementary Table 8).
We then utilized the data across missions (I4, Twins Study and JAXA), 
assays (scRNA-seq, cfRNA, bulk RNA-seq and proteomics) and cell 
types (CD4, CD8, CD14 and CD16) to find the most recurrent pathways 
associated with spaceflight. The most enriched pathways were antigen 
binding, haemoglobin, cytokine signalling and immune activation, 
which confirmed the DEG-related signatures and also validated the 
signatures from our I4 mission (Fig. 5). Moreover, the NASA Twins Study 
data and cfRNA profiles from the JAXA study confirmed many of the 
top-ranked pathways, while also showing differences between bulk 
blood RNA and protein markers and purified cell populations. These 
data indicate that leveraging both bulk and sorted cell populations 
can help to clarify signals coming from crew blood dynamics related 
to spaceflight.
Access to datasets and crew samples
This study introduces full accessibility of astronaut data to the sci-
entific community. Datasets are accessible through an online web 
portal and scientific data repositories, as well as controlled access 
to more sensitive data (for example, genetic sequence data) and 
physical specimens. The online web portal splits the data into three 
data browsers: the SOMA browser, the I4 single-cell browser and the 
microbiome browser (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). The SOMA browser 
(https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/SOMA_Browser/) enables visu-
alization of gene expression (bulk RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, cfRNA-seq 
and spatially resolved transcriptomics), mass spectrometry (plasma 
proteomics, plasma metabolomics and plasma EVP proteomics) and 
microbial (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic) data. Gene expres-
sion and protein abundance are visualized for each astronaut by time-
point, with fold-change values, statistical significance (q value) and 
summary tables. Any selected gene is also then plotted across data 
for other missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the NASA Twins 
Study, mouse spaceflight datasets from NASA OSDR and Genelab, and 
control cohorts. For additional granularity, the single-cell browser 
(https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Multiome/) provides 
visualizations specific to single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) 
and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data, and includes qual-
ity metrics, cell-type annotations, gene co-expression and chro-
matin accessibility magnitude estimates. Finally, the microbiome 
browser contains metagenomic and metatranscriptomic boxplots 
(https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Microbiome/) from each 
timepoint of the study, spanning eight skin locations, deltoid swabs 
collected pre-skin biopsy, swabs of the SpaceX Dragon capsule and 
stool samples.
The remaining biospecimens from this study have been preserved 
and catalogued for continued use by the scientific community 
(https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/). These samples include venous 
blood plasma, venous blood serum, viably frozen PBMCs, vacutainer 
red blood cell pellets, urine (both crude and with nucleic acid pre-
servative), extracted saliva nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), extracted 
whole-blood total RNA, extracted skin swab nucleic acids (DNA and 
RNA) and extracted stool nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). A subset of 
these samples will be available for additional assays and hypoth-
esis testing by other groups, and the remainder are allocated for 
long-term biobanking. These data and specimen resources for astro-
nauts can help enable larger cohorts for increased statistical power 
and also for new biomedical technologies that will emerge in the 
future.

Discussion
Overall, these data represent a comprehensive clinical and multi-omic 
resource from commercial and non-commercial astronaut cohorts, 
creating, to our knowledge, the first-ever aerospace medicine biobank, 
while providing a platform for private citizens to contribute to future 
astronaut biomedical studies. In addition, we have demonstrated 
that short-duration, high-elevation (585 km) spaceflight results in 
broad-ranging molecular changes, in which some of these changes 
mirror what has been observed during longer-duration spaceflight, 
including elevated cytokines, telomere elongation and gene expres-
sion changes for immune activation, DNA damage response and oxi-
dative stress. Although more than 95% of markers return to baseline 
in the months after the mission had ended, some proteins, genes and 
cytokines appear to be activated only in the recovery period after space-
flight and persist post-flight for at least 3 months.
These results collectively indicate a dynamic recovery profile that 
substantially reverses the direction of differential gene expression in 
multiple key biological pathways from the post-flight timepoint (R+1) 
and afterward. This suggests that re-adaptation to Earth activates a 
range of restorative mechanisms that help to recover, at least in part, 
the physiological stress imposed by exposure to the space environ-
ment. The systematic analysis of the molecular and cellular changes 
observed post-flight afford us with a unique opportunity to capture 
naturally occurring health-restoring mechanisms, which can be used 
for therapeutic target discovery. Furthermore, we observed a nuanced 
regulatory landscape, in which enriched recovery pathways are both 
unique to individual cell types and span cell types in unique combina-
tions. We have carefully indexed various profiles for flight, recovery and 
longitudinal analysis that are annotated in processed data files available 
in the NASA OSDR. The RP1 profile indicates that we need more frequent 
sampling in the 1–2 months directly after flight to untangle the gene 
and pathway responses during re-adaptation from spaceflight. This 
will be especially true during longer missions, in which re-adaptation 
will probably be more intense.
Of note, these data are, to our knowledge, the first-ever joint single- 
nucleus chromatin profiles (RNA and ATAC) for astronauts, and they 
also leverage new methods that can track gene expression and epige-
netic changes within the same cells. This single-cell, dual-measurement 
assay provides new data on the molecular changes and regulatory 
response to spaceflight (for example, chromatin and TFBS accessibil-
ity), and the data revealed distinct levels of stress and adaptation by 
each cell type. Specifically, the T cell and monocyte cell populations 
(CD14 and CD16) had the largest changes in expression and response 
of any cell type. The differences between PBMC subpopulations also 
suggest that single-cell sequencing can be helpful for delineating 
unique cell-type responses in future studies as well. Indeed, although 
the immune system and haematopoietic systems both show thousands 
of transient changes at the gene expression level, the chromatin archi-
tecture is distinctly disrupted, in both scale and duration, in these CD14+ 
and CD16+ monocyte populations. These cell types were also found to 
be disrupted in the NASA Twins Study7,23, and thus represent a key cell 
type to be studied for future missions.
The cfRNA, dRNA and spatial RNA profiles revealed unique profiles 
that differed based on recovery and longitudinal analysis, suggesting 
that the multi-omic footprint of spaceflight is much wider than previ-
ously observed. Although some focused studies of cfRNA have shown 
that it can be used to detect mitochondrial increase in blood related 
to spaceflight7–9,24, to our knowledge, it had never been applied as a 
‘full-body molecular scan’ to detect differential tissue and cell stress. 
Of note, the SOMA resource enables comparisons of the cfRNAs and 
cell-encapsulated RNAs, as well as the exosomal fractions, all within 
the same framework, which is essential for delineating and ranking the 
cells and tissues in the body that are the most disrupted by spaceflight. 
Similar to the utility of single-cell data23, the granularity of seeing cell 
lysis from all tissues across the body in one assay makes cfRNA profil-
ing an ideal addition to some of the proposed standard measures for 
spaceflight monitoring. So far, cfRNA data indicate that each part of 
the body may show its own transcriptional response, shedding rate 
or RNA excretion rates, and thus each tissue should be examined on 
its own and then compared with other sites and assays. Similarly, in 
the microbiome data, the taxonomic classifications yielded differ-
ences in variation by body site, timepoint and crew member (Extended 
Data Fig. 8), indicating the need for multi-site and multi-omic sam-
pling for ideal understanding of microbiome changes associated with 
spaceflight.
However, this study is not without limitations. Although cell-specific 
comparisons could be made between the I4 mission and previous 
studies, the assays and collection protocols were slightly different 
(for example, column purification versus droplet-sorted cells), and 
thus comparisons will be imperfect. In addition, although the same 
tube types and methods were used whenever possible, cross-mission 
comparisons will inevitably include noise from various other types of 
technical variation, including batches of library preparation and extrac-
tion kits, slightly different collection intervals (L−3 versus L−10) and 
different sequencing or profiling technologies (for example, Illumina 
versus Ultima or liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry 
versus NULISASeq). Finally, as our comparisons to other NASA and JAXA 
datasets span, at most, 64 astronauts, these data are not sufficient to 
guide medical interventions or inference of mechanisms. As such, these 
SOMA data and resources should be viewed as preliminary molecular 
maps of the response of the human body to spaceflight.
Future directions
Nonetheless, the data from the I4 mission will be an invaluable 
resource for future studies. Deep analyses of secretome profiling25, 
single-nucleus multiome26, viral activation and ecological restructur-
ing27, skin spatial transcriptomic profiling28, epitranscriptomic profil-
ing22, and genome integrity and clonal haematopoiesis29 have already 
leveraged this resource. In future missions, additional biomedical pro-
filing can help to delineate the short-term and long-term health effects 
of spaceflight, including changes in telomere length dynamics, DNA 
methylation, non-coding RNAs, as well as additional sample types, 
such as hair follicles, tears, sperm and other biospecimens. Indeed, 
the remaining samples from the I4 mission have been biobanked for 
just this reason and to help the scientific community tackle future 
objectives12. In addition, aliquots of DNA, RNA, protein, serum, urine 
and stool from the protocols performed in this paper have acquired 
consent for release and are available (https://cambank.weill.cornell.
edu/) for request, in which researchers can then append new results 
to this extensible SOMA repository.
Differences between the biomedical and cellular responses of crew 
members may be caused by several factors, including inter-individual 
genetic differences (Fig. 5), the duration of the mission, the higher 
flight elevation (585 km), the unique environment of the SpaceX 
Dragon capsule, or a combination of these and other factors. To 
address these hypotheses, other molecular assays can be informa-
tive for future missions, including other epigenetics and chromatin 
conformation assays. For example, we have investigated using the 
method cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (Cut&Run) 
to profile histone modifications using 5,000 and 10,000 T cells as 
assay input (Supplementary Fig. 3a), down from the 10 million cells 
recommended in the original protocol30. T cells were collected 
from C002 during the R+194 recovery timepoint, but showed high 
variance at lower input. Nonetheless, the combination of current 
modifications profiled can be used to annotate active enhancer 
regions in the genome (Supplementary Fig. 3b), which is a novel pro-
file for astronauts, and opens the door to better understanding of 
the gene-regulatory changes induced by spaceflight for each crew 
member.

Molecular changes described here can also help to guide research 
and countermeasure development, but are only the start of the process 
of mitigating risks, especially as year-long and multi-year space habitat 
missions will represent greater biomedical challenges. To aid in this 
effort, the SOMA resource will continue to expand as further samples 
are sequenced from the I4 mission11,12 and samples are collected from 
future missions that travel farther into space, and then compared with 
other longitudinal, multi-omics cohorts31. Biospecimen samples have 
been collected and processed from Polaris and Axiom crews, and this 
Atlas also represents an open call for research participation for astro-
nauts from any commercial or governmental programs.
Finally, although the multi-omic data and resources from the I4 crew 
represent the largest release of data from astronauts to date, the I4 
crew is still a small cohort, and represents only the first step towards 
resolving the many hazards and needs for long-term missions32, build-
ing towards enough statistical power and contextualization of normal 
human biological variation33,34. Fortunately, one of the crew mem-
bers for I4 will continue to donate to the SOMA Biobank for multiple 
missions, including the Polaris Dawn mission, and data and samples 
from additional crews (for example, long-term Twins Study follow-up, 
Axiom Saudi, JAXA and Malta missions) are now being collected and 
integrated. These cross-mission datasets create a unique opportu-
nity for long-term, in-depth analysis of the effect of spaceflight on the 
human body. Such data are especially important as missions travel 
farther away from Earth35 and for longer periods of time, in which the 
data and biomedical discoveries can help to prepare commercial and 
state-sponsored agencies for the lunar, Mars and exploration-class 
missions.

Methods
Institutional Review Board statement
All participants consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX, 
and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the 
Institutional Review Board at Weill Cornell Medicine, under protocol 
21-05023569. All crew members consented to data and sample sharing.
I4 data compendium data generation
Full methodology for sample preparation, nucleic acid/protein 
extraction, sequencing, mass spectrometry and analysis are reported 
in Supplementary Note 1. Sample collection has been previously 
reported12.
I4 versus NASA Twins Study cytokine analysis
Differential abundance analyses of cytokines and other analytes were 
conducted using a mixed-effects model. This model included fixed 
effects for time, treated as a categorical variable with levels correspond-
ing to preflight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), immediate return (R+1) and recov-
ery periods (R+45, R+82 and R+194). In addition, participant-specific 
effects were incorporated as random effects in the model. The P values 
for the coefficients obtained from this model were adjusted for multiple 
comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.
10x Genomics snRNA-seq negative control data
We acquired cryovials of PBMCs from a healthy man 22 years of age 
(AllCells) and stored them in vapour-phase liquid nitrogen cryotanks. 
Two cryovials from this donor were thawed and processed on two dif-
ferent days in the same week, at the same laboratory, using the 10x 
Genomics demonstrated protocol called Nuclei Isolation for Single 
Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000365). From 
each day’s nuclei suspension, ATAC and gene expression libraries were 
generated (in technical triplicates on the same chip) according to the 
Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User 
Guide (CG000338) and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencer. The 
resulting single-nucleus GEX and single-nucleus ATAC files were aligned 
using the cellranger-arc pipeline (v2.0.2) from 10x Genomics against 
the human reference genome hg38. Quality control and cell annotation 
were performed on the snGEX gene-cell matrices using the R Seurat 
package (v4.2.0)36. Subpopulations were clustered and labelled using a 
publicly available Azimuth human PBMC reference37 in conjunction with 
Seurat’s supervised clustering functionality. DEG analysis for labelled 
subpopulations was performed using the FindMarkers functionality of 
Seurat, with a log fold change (logFC) cut-off point of 0.5. P values of 
resultant genes were measured using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and 
deemed significant for P < 0.05. Correlation of chromatin accessibility 
and gene expression changes in FP1 was characterized by summing 
up the accessibility in a promoter window consisting of the transcrip-
tion start site ± 500 bp for every cell in a given cell type across every 
gene, normalizing it to counts per million, taking the log2 difference 
between the different timepoints and matching it to the log2FC from 
the differential RNA analysis.
Recovery profile analysis
DEGs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data 
were filtered for |logFC| > 0.5 and adjusted P < 0.05 for the FP1, RP1, RP2 
and LP2 profiles. An UpSet plot of shared genes was generated using 
Intervene38. Overrepresented pathways were calculated using Web­
Gestalt39 using the default parameters and the KEGG database. Pathways 
included in the analysis were within the top 40 lowest false discovery 
rate values or all pathways with a false discovery rate under 0.05.
Transcription factor motif accessibility analysis
chromVAR40 was used for the analysis of sparse chromatin accessibility 
from 10x Genomics single-cell data. The FindMarkers function of the 
Seurat package was used for differential analysis with setting mean.
fxn as rowMeans and fc.name = “avg_diff”. The top five differentially 
accessible transcription factor motifs from each cell type from the 
PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data for the FP1, RP1 and RP2 were 
selected for visualization by heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated by 
the ComplexHeatmap R package.
Calculation of individual variation
To distinguish the analytes that varied with the greatest magnitude 
between individual crew members (C001, C002, C003 and C004), a 
coefficient of variation (CV) calculation was applied across measure-
ments collected for each: metagenomic species, metatranscriptomic 
species, plasma protein abundance, EVP protein abundance, metabolite 
abundance, cytokine abundances (Alamar Bio) and gene expression val-
ues (Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq). CV calculations 
were performed using the formula ‘np.std(x, ddof = 0)/np.mean(x)’, 
where ‘x’ is the array of normalized analyte values and ‘np’ refers to the 
numpy scientific computing package (v = 1.26). CV calculations were 
split into pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), post-flight (R+1) and recovery 
(R+45 and R+82) intervals. The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic 
data also include the in-flight (FD2 and FD3) interval.
Before performing the CV calculation, data were first normalized. The 
‘limma’ R package was applied to the plasma proteomic, EVP proteomic 
and metabolite data (v3.52). DESeq2 (v1.36.0) was applied to the Oxford 
Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq data. For microbiome data, 
to measure individual contributions per astronaut and for each tissue 
type (‘armpit’, ‘forearm’, ‘nasal’, ‘oral’, ‘post-auricular’, ‘T-zone’, among 
others), we averaged MetaPhlAn4, species-level, relative abundance 
values across our collected sample points. CVs were calculated for 
individual genes, proteins and microbial organisms.
An abundance standardized CV calculation was also performed to 
correct for the mean/CV relationship in the assays. First, the normal-
ized abundance values across all the analytes of a given dataset were 
split into approximately 100 mean-abundance quantiles (M_q where q 
is 1–100 or fewer, in case it resulted in less than 10 points per quantile 
group). For each quantile group, the mean and the standard deviation of 
CV values for the analytes belonging to M_q were calculated (CVmean_q 
and CVs.d._q, respectively) to prepare the mean/CV distribution refer-
ence set across all timepoints and samples. Then, for a given timepoint, 
the CV calculated for each analyte was matched to the corresponding 
CVmean_q and CVs.d._q based on cross-referencing to the M_q interval 
overlap. Finally, the abundance standardized CV was calculated as the 
z score of the CV as (CV − CVmean_q)/(CVs.d._q). Permutation testing 
of the post-flight versus pre-flight difference was performed by repeat-
ing this procedure 10,000 times on shuffled labels for samples, taking 
the difference. Rank and z score of the observed value were calculated 
against the random permutations to order the genes and used as input 
to fGSEA for pathway enrichment analysis. Gene Ontology analysis on 
abundance standardized CVs was performed with Enrichr41,42 using 
the default settings.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Direct RNA-seq Gene Expression and RNA m6A 
Modifications Across 13 Comparative Profiles. (a) Patterns of gene 
expression across seven time points and 13 comparisons. Left: z-scored 
log-transformed normalized gene counts obtained from salmon (bottom left 
of each cell) and featureCounts (top right of each cell). Right: log2(fold-change) 
values obtained from edgeR (bottom left of each cell) and from DESeq2  
(top right of each cell). The genes are clustered by z-scored log-transformed 
normalized counts using the correlation distance metric. (b) Patterns of 
base-level m6A modifications across seven time points and 13 comparisons. 
Left: z-scored log-transformed positional methylation probabilities obtained 
from m6anet. Right: percentage of change in methylation between the 
conditions in each comparison, obtained from methylKit. The sites are 
clustered by the pattern of differential methylation across all comparisons 
using the correlation distance metric. On both panes (a) and (b), only the genes 
and sites with significant differences in expression and/or methylation in at 
least one comparison are plotted; the significance of individual comparisons  
is annotated with up and down arrows.

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Single-Nuclei RNA-Sequencing Controls. (a) The 
number of DEGs in I4 flight profiles (FP1: grouped crew or individual crew 
members), I4 longitudinal profiles (LP3: grouped crew or individual crew 
members), and negative control groups (mock control day 2 vs day 1, mock 
control same day technical replicate differences, and I4 inter-subject 
comparisons in preflight). All comparisons were done with downsampling  
to the same number of cells. Intra-timepoint subject comparisons are crew-to- 
crew comparison in the pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3), immediately post-flight 
(R + 1), and recovery (R + 45, R + 82) time intervals. The bars show the mean of 
the total number of DEGs, and error bars show the standard error for groups 
that have 3 or more comparisons summarized. (n = 4 independent subjects 
with 6 timepoints, and n = 1 control subject with 2 timepoints and 3 technical 
scRNAseq replicates for each timepoint.) (b) The number of total DEGs identified 
by DESeq2 and pseudobulk counts in I4 flight profiles (FP1), I4 longitudinal 
profiles (LP3), and negative control groups (mock control day 2 vs day 1). All 
comparisons were done with aggregation into a single sample for each crew 
and each cell type. The bars show the mean of the total number of DEGs. (c) DEG 
directionality heatmap represents the overlap of up-regulated (orange) and 
down-regulated (purple) DEGs across comparison groups (I4 timepoint 
comparisons, I4 individual variation, 10x negative controls). (d) Heatmap 
representing the log2 fold-change of I4-FP1 up-regulated and down-regulated 
PBMC DEGs in each comparison group (I4 timepoint comparisons, I4 individual 
variation, 10x Genomics negative controls).

the T cell and monocyte lineages for DEGs present in RP1, but not present in the 
FP1 profile. (b) Overrepresented KEGG pathways from DEG sets unique to the 
RP1 profile in the t-cell and monocyte lineages. The percent of pathways unique 
to each cell type are quantified along with the various configurations in which 
the pathway is shared between cell types and lineages.

change of chromatin accessibility at promoters of genes that are differentially 
expressed in FP across different cell types. Promoters are defined as the 
transcription start site ± 500 bp of a given gene. Two-sided p-values were 
calculated by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Violin plots show the density of  
the points, and the center white dot represents the median, and the white  
line shows the range of the first and third quartiles. (b) Directionality of delta 
z-score for motif accessibility between flight profile FP1 and recovery profiles 
RP1 and RP2 for significant TF motifs of FP1 present in either RP1 or RP2.  
(c) Heatmap of accessibility z-score of top5 significantly increased and 
decreased TFs in each cell type in FP1. (d) Heatmap of accessibility z-score  
of top5 significantly increased and decreased TFs in each cell type in RP1.  
(e) Heatmap of accessibility z-score of top5 significantly increased and 
decreased TFs in each cell type in RP2.

Article
Extended Data Fig. 10 | SOMA Web Portals. (a) Three different web portals 
were created: SOMA Browser, Single-Cell Browser, and Microbial Browser.  
The SOMA Browser includes (b) gene expression and protein abundance 
measurements in line chart and volcano plot formats, (c) log fold change 
calculations, and (d) comparison of DEGs across different contrasts, assays, 
studies, and organisms (statistical tests dependent on comparison, please  
see website). (e) The Single-Cell Browser enables visualization of cell type 
specific information, including gene co-expression and ATAC-seq region peak 
visualization. (f) The Microbial Browser includes microbial abundances  
across timepoints from different annotation databases for metagenomic and 
metatranscriptomic datasets (n = 4 independent subjects for 8 timepoints and 
12 collection sites, or n = 9 environmental samples for 4 timepoints). The center 
of the boxplots represent the median, the box hinges encompass the first and 
third quartiles, and whiskers extend to the smallest and largest value no further 
than the 1.5x interquartile range (IQR) away from the hinges.
