Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that
began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020.
Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed.
Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid
diagnosis of speciﬁc COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within
a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identiﬁcation, surface enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached
to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles,
owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color
from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by
the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus
particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated
gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike
antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Finite-
diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement
in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our
reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based
SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg)
per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using
HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters
human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit
infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-
CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus
infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus.
Introduction
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-
2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease of 2019
(COVID-19), is responsible for huge global disruption to health
and economies.1–10 As of 13 November 2020, more than 59.4
million people have suﬀered from COVID-19 disease and
around 1.40 million have died worldwide1,2. It is now well
documented that spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and
nucleocapsid (N) are the important structural proteins for
coronavirus particles.6–16 Several reports indicate that spike
protein plays the most important role for virus entry and disease
pathogenesis.3–14 Because at the time of writing there are no
FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for the treatment of
COVID-19 disease, rapid diagnosis is the key to slowing the
spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.1–20 Driven by the urgent
need, we report the development of an anti-spike antibody
attached gold nanoparticle (GNP) for rapid diagnosis of specic
COVID-19 viral antigen (COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen)
or the virus itself via naked eye colorimetric change and highly
sensitive

GNPs to which three diﬀerent (spike, envelope, and membrane)
antibodies were attached.14 In the current manuscript, we show
that anti-spike antibody attached GNPs are capable of ultra-
sensitive identication as well as inhibition of virus particles.
As we and others have reported before, owing to good
biocompatibility, size dependent optical properties and ease of
modication of the surface, gold nanoparticles can be used for
the development of excellent biosensing platforms.17–33 As
shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI,† the color of our anti-spike
antibody attached gold nanoparticle is pink and it changed to
a bluish tinge in the presence of the COVID-19 antigen or virus
owing to aggregation via antigen–antibody interaction. As
a result, we observed a color change upon aggregation. Based on
color observation with the naked eye, we can detect COVID-19
antigen even at a concentration of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL
and virus particles at a concentration of 1000 virus particles per
mL. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 (BSL-3) virus, we
have used a BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped
baculovirus (pseudo SARS-CoV-2) as a model system for our
diagnosis and inhibition experiments.36,37
Owing to its extremely high sensitivity, SERS can be used for
detection of very low levels of viruses, bacteria, cancer cells and
diﬀerent biomolecules.17–27 It is now well documented that
Raman signals can be enhanced by several orders (107 to 1010)
of magnitude by using plasmonic nanoparticles via the elec-
tromagnetic
mechanism
(EM)
and
chemical
mechanism
(CM).17–27 For rapid and highly sensitive identication, SERS has
been employed using 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) as reporter
molecule, attached to gold nanoparticles via Au–S bonds. In the
presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, the aggregated
nanoparticles form “hot spots”. As we and other groups have
reported, that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor to
provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS;17–27 in the pres-
ence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles strong SERS signals
from 4-aminothiophenol have been observed, which allow
diagnosis of viral antigen even at a concentration of 4
picograms (pg) per mL and virus at 18 virus particles per mL
concentration.
It is now well documented that for SARS-CoV-2, the viral
infection starts with the binding of viral particles to receptors
on the host cells, mediated by the virus spike protein.8–17,34–41 As
diﬀerent studies indicate that spike protein binds specically to
the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on
the surface of human cells,8–17 scientists from several groups are
developing inhibitors that have the capability to block the
mechanism by which the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor.34–41
Herein, using pseudo SARS-CoV-2 as the model virus, we
demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nano-
particles have the capability to block viral entry into cells.
Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is a BSL-1 baculovirus pseudotyped with
spike (S) protein. Using HEK293T cells, which express ACE2, by
means of which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we demon-
strate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles
block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells.
Experimental section
Citrate coated gold nanoparticle synthesis
As shown in Fig. S1A in the ESI,† citrate coated gold nano-
particles (GNPs) were synthesized using HAuCl4$3H2O and
sodium citrate, as we and others have reported before.17–30 For
this purpose, we used a 0.01% solution of HAuCl4$3H2O and
1 wt% of sodium citrate. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and colorimetric and dynamic light scattering (DLS)
data were used to characterize the freshly synthesized nano-
particles. Table 1 shows the DLS data, indicating that the size of
the freshly prepared citrate coated GNPs is 15  2 nm. The
inset picture in Fig. S1A† shows the color of freshly prepared
GNPs is pink. As we and others have reported before, GNPs
exhibit unique optical properties due to surface plasmon reso-
nance (SPR).17–30 It is well documented that the SPR band for
citrate coated gold nanoparticles is due to phase changes
resulting from the increased rate of electron-surface collisions
compared with larger particles.28–33 Fig. 1A shows the absorption
spectra of citrate coated gold nanoparticles, in which lmax is
seen to be 520 nm. As we and others have reported before,20–33
SPR of gold nanoparticles yields exceptionally high absorption,
with extinction coeﬃcient 3(15)520nm ¼ 3.6  108 cm1 M1,
which we used here for sensing of COVID-19 antigen or virus
using naked eye colorimetric study.
The X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) spectrum from citrate coated
gold nanoparticles shown in Fig. S2D† shows (111), (200), (220)
and (311) diﬀraction peaks, due to face centered cubic gold
(JCPDS 04-0784).20–30 The particle concentration was measured
by UV-visible spectroscopy using the molar extinction coeﬃ-
cient at the wavelength of the maximum absorption of the gold
colloid (3(15)519nm ¼ 3.6  108 cm1 M1), as we and others have
reported before.28–30
PEG coated gold nanoparticle synthesis
In the next step, as shown in Fig. S1B in the ESI,† to render the
GNPs biocompatible, they were coated with HS-PEG-COOH. For

this purpose, we used carboxy-PEG12-thiol (HS-PEG12-COOH).
We dissolved 10 mg of HS-PEG12-COOH in 5 mL of water and
then added citrate coated GNPs using a syringe and vigorous
stirring. Aer sonication of the mixture for 30 minutes, the nal
products were separated through centrifugation. As reported in
Table 1, aer PEG coating, the size of the GNPs had increased to
18  4 nm. The inset picture in Fig. S1B† shows that the color
of freshly prepared PEG coated GNPs is pink. Fig. 1A shows the
absorption spectrum of PEG coated gold nanoparticles, in
which lmax is 521 nm, which indicates that aer coating with
PEG, the optical spectrum for GNPs remains almost the same.
Anti-spike antibody coated gold nanoparticle synthesis
For targeted diagnosis and inhibition, we developed anti-spike
antibody attached gold nanoparticles. For this purpose, we
used
EDC
(1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide)/
NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) chemistry. In short, we added
0.2 molar (M) EDC and 0.05 M N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
sodium salt [1 : 3 (v/v) ratio] to a solution containing GNPs and
anti-spike antibody, and the mixture was sonicated for 30
minutes. Aer that, anti-spike antibody attached GNPs were
separated from GNPs without antibody via centrifugation for 15
minutes at 6000 rpm, followed by resuspension in buﬀer. As
reported in Table 1, aer antibody attachment the size of GNPs
had increased to 27  6 nm. To determine how many anti-
bodies were attached to the GNPs, we synthesized Cy3 dye
attached anti-spike antibody conjugated GNPs. Aer separation
of the Cy3 dye attached antibody conjugated GNPs from
unconjugated molecules, we added 10 mM potassium cyanide to
oxidize the GNPs. Aer that, from uorescence data we esti-
mated that about 10 ng mL1 antibodies were attached on
GNPs.
The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum from anti-
spike
antibody
attached
gold
nanoparticles
shown
in
Fig. S2E† contains amide-A, amide-I, amide-II and amide-II
bands, which indicates that anti-spike-antibodies are attached
on the surface of the gold nanoparticles. The inset picture in
Fig. S1C† shows the color of freshly prepared antibody GNPs is
pink. Fig. 2D shows the absorption spectra of antibody attached
gold nanoparticles, in which lmax is 522 nm, which indicate
that aer attaching antibody, the optical spectrum for GNPs
remains almost the same.
The X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) spectra from antibody attached
gold nanoparticles as reported in Fig. S2D† show (111), (200),
(220) and (311) diﬀraction peaks, which indicate that the crystal
structure remains the same aer conjugation with antibody.
Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy using anti-spike
antibody attached gold nanoparticles
For the detection of COVID-19 antigen and virus using SERS, we
used our developed portable Raman spectrometer with laser
excitation of 670 nm.22–24,26,27 In our design we have used an
InPhotonics 670 nm Raman ber optic probe for excitation and
data collection. For SERS signal collection, we used a miniatur-
ized
QE65000
Scientic-grade
Spectrometer
from
Ocean
Optics.22–24,26,27 All SERS spectra were taken on drop-cast dried
glass slides. For Raman data collection we used 10 second
acquisition time and 5-scan averaging, so that we could achieve
very good signal-to-noise ratio.22–24,26,27

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles
Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 (Cat. # C1110G) was purchased from Mon-
tana Molecular, Bozeman, MT 59715, USA. HEK293T cells
(ATCC # CRL3216) plated in twelve-well tissue culture dishes
were infected with the pseudotyped virus with a dilution range
of 102 to 107, and virus titers were calculated by counting green
uorescent protein (GFP) positive cells under a uorescence
microscope.36–38
Virus inhibition assays
HEK293T cells (ATCC # CRL3216) were plated on a 96-well plate
in complete medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) and incubated under
normal growth conditions (5% CO2 and 37 C, protected from
light) for 12–24 hours.36–38 These HEK293T cells express low
levels of ACE2 receptor which are suﬃcient for SARS-CoV-2
entry. Dilutions of test nanoparticles were made in DMEM
with a nal volume of 100 mL each.36–38 The pseudovirus stock
(2.5 mL of the 2  1010 units permL stock) was mixed with the
diluted nanoparticles and incubated for 1 h at 37 C, then laid
over HEK293T cells plated in the 96-well tissue culture dishes,
along with 0.6 mL of 500 nM sodium butyrate (to give a nal
concentration of 2 mM). Plates were incubated at 37 C under
5% CO2 for 48 h. Cells were xed in 3.7% formaldehyde and the
assay was read on a Cytation 5 automated uorescence micro-
scope (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).36–38
Results and discussion
Naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen using
anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles
Antigen tests are used in clinics to diagnose diﬀerent virus
infections, and now the FDA has approved rapid antigen tests
that can identify SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, our experimental data
indicate that naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19
antigens can be performed within 5 minutes using anti-spike
antibody attached gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. S1D in
the ESI,† naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 anti-
gens using antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in
the presence of COVID-19 antigen, as a result of antigen–anti-
body interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregate, as shown
in Fig. S2A–C in the ESI.† As a result, as shown in Fig. 1A–C, we
have observed the color of the suspension of antibody attached
GNPs change from pink to blue, which is due to the surface
plasmon coupling between antibody attached GNPs. The TEM
images in Fig. S2A–C† and DLS data in Table 1 show that as we
increased the amount of COVID-19 antigen, the size of anti-
spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles increased tremen-
dously owing to aggregation. As we and others have reported
before, when the interparticle distances are 2.5 times lower
than the diameter of the nanoparticles, the aggregation of gold
nanoparticles will induce the coupling of the plasmon modes
very strongly, which will induce a red shiof the absorption
spectrum.28–33 The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1D show
a red shifrom 520 to 600 nm for aggregated antibody attached
GNPs. The reported absorption spectra also indicate the
broadening of the plasmon resonance peak aer aggregation of

antibody attached GNPs, which could be due to longitudinal
resonance.
To determine the sensitivity of naked eye colorimetric assay
for the identication of COVID-19 antigen using antibody
attached
GNPs,
we
performed
an
antigen
concentration
dependence study using from 1 pg mL1 to 10 000 pg mL1
COVID-19 antigen. As shown in Fig. 1B, naked eye colorimetric
assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentra-
tion of 1000 pg mL1 or 1 ng mL1 antigen. Next, we determined
the selectivity of the naked eye colorimetric assay for the iden-
tication of COVID-19 antigen using antibody attached GNPs.
Since COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) are all coronaviruses, we also performed the same
experiment for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen
separately using anti-spike antibody attached gold nano-
particles. As shown in Fig. 1C, we did not observe any colori-
metric change even when 5 ng mL1 SARS-CoV virus antigen or
MERS-CoV antigen was added to the pink solution of anti-spike
antibody attached gold nanoparticles. The above reported data
clearly show that the antibody attached GNP-based naked eye
colorimetric assay is highly selective for COVID-19 spike-
antigen.
Naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using
antibody attached GNPs
As we have discussed above, since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3
(BSL-3) virus, we used a BSL-2 pseudo SARS-CoV-2 with spike (S)
protein as a model system for our diagnosis experiment.36,37 As
shown in Fig. S1E and 2E,† naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of
pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs is based on the
fact that in the presence of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, as a result of the
virus spike protein–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs
aggregate on the surface of the virus, as shown in Fig. 2A–C. Since
the size of the pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is around 120–160 nm, several
antibody attached GNPs can aggregate on the surface of each virus
particle. The TEM image in Fig. 2C shows that as we increased the
concentration of antibody attached GNPs, owing to the virus spike
protein–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregated
and covered the entire surface of the virus particles. As a result, as
shown in Fig. 2E, we observed the color of the suspension of
antibody attached GNPs change from pink to blue, as a result of
surface plasmon coupling between antibody attached GNPs. Our
reported naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2
using antibody attached GNPs is very quick and it takes less
than 5 minutes to get the results. The absorption spectra in Fig. 2D
show a red shiof absorption from 520 to 640 nm for aggregated
antibody attached GNPs in the presence of pseudo SARS-CoV-2.
To determine the sensitivity of naked eye colorimetric assay
for the identication of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody
attached GNPs, we performed a pseudo SARS-CoV-2 concen-
tration dependence study from 10 virus particles per mL to 5000
virus particles per mL. As shown in Fig. 2E, naked eye colori-
metric assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum
concentration of 1000 virus particles per mL of pseudo SARS-
CoV-2. Our reported naked eye colorimetric assay for SARS
virus detection exhibits slightly higher sensitivity than the
antibody attached GNP-based inuenza A virus detection as
reported by Liu et al.40
Highly sensitive SERS diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen and
pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs
Although naked eye colorimetric assay is capable of the iden-
tication of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2 within
a 5 minute time period, the sensitivity is low. To enhance the
sensitivity signicantly, we employed SERS for the diagnosis of
COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2. As shown in Fig. 3A,
for rapid and highly sensitive identication via SERS, we used 4-
aminothiophenol as reporter molecule, which is attached to
gold nanoparticles via Au–S bonds. Synthesis details are re-
ported in the ESI.†
Fig. 3B shows the SERS spectra from anti-spike antibody (10
ng mL1) only attached GNPs (1.3 nM), 4-aminothiophenol (300
nM) only attached GNPs (1.3 nM) and antibody (10 ng mL1) as
well as 4-aminothiophenol (300 nM) attached gold nano-
particles (1.3 nM). As shown in Fig. 3B, in the absence of the 4-
aminothiophenol Raman reporter, we did not see any Raman
signal, which clearly shows that the observed Raman spectrum
is mainly due to the presence of the 4-aminothiophenol Raman
reporter. The Raman spectrum in Fig. 3B from anti-spike anti-
body and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles
shows Raman peaks due to the a1 vibrational modes: n(C–C +
NH2

at
1590
cm1
and
n[n(C–C)
+
d(C–H)]
at
1078 cm1.17–27 Similarly, we also observed b2 mode Raman
peaks from the anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol
attached gold nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3B: CC stretch in
Ph ring + NH2 rock at 1435 cm1 and n(C–N) + n(C–S) + g(CCC)
vibrational modes at 464 cm1.17–27
Our SERS-based diagnosis of COVID-19 antigens using
antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in the presence
of COVID-19 antigen, owing to the antigen–antibody interac-
tion, antibody attached GNPs aggregate and form several “hot
spots”, as shown in Fig. S2A–C in the ESI.† It is now well
documented that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor
to provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS, owing to the
strong
light–matter
interaction
via
plasmon-excitation
coupling.17–27 As shown in Fig. 3C, very strong SERS signals
from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold
nanoparticles are observed in the presence of COVID-19 Spike
Recombinant Antigen; this is due to the formation of huge
amounts
of
electromagnetic
“hotspots”,
which
enhances
Raman intensity by several orders of magnitude via light–matter
and matter–matter interactions.17–27
To understand better how “hot spot” formation greatly
enhances the SERS signal, we performed nite-diﬀerence time-
domain (FDTD) simulation.22–24,42,43 Theoretical details have
been reported before by our group and other groups.22–24,26,27,42,43
For the simulation, we used 20 nm spherical gold nanoparticles,
670 nm wavelength, 0.001 nm mesh resolution, and 4000 fs
time.22–24,26,27 Fig. 3H shows how the square of eld enhance-
ment (|E|2) varies with distance for nanoparticles. The FDTD
simulation data in Fig. 3H indicate a more than 2 orders of

magnitude higher eld enhancement in “hot spot” positions
when gold nanoparticles formed aggregates. As we and others
have reported before, Raman enhancement is proportional to
|E|4,22–24,26,27,42,43 and as a result, reported FDTD simulation data
indicate that there is a possibility of 4 orders of magnitude
Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nano-
particles form aggregates.
Having observed a huge Raman signal enhancement in the
presence of COVID-19 antigen, to determine the sensitivity of
SERS assay for the identication of COVID-19 antigen using
anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold
nanoparticles, we performed an antigen concentration depen-
dence study using 1 pg mL1 to 2000 pg mL1 COVID-19
antigen. As shown in Fig. 3C, SERS assay can be used for the
diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1 pg mL1 antigen,
where we observed a more than 2-fold increment of the Raman
signal. Fig. 3D shows how the Raman signal at 1078 cm1 from
anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold
nanoparticles varies with the concentration of COVID-19
antigen.
To determine the limit of detection (LOD), we used the
following equation:22–24
LOD ¼ 3s/S
(1)
where s is the standard deviation of the blank and S is the slope
of the calibration curve. For the determination of the standard
deviation of the blank, we used the baseline noise. Using the
concentration–dependence plot shown in Fig. 3D, we estimated
the LOD to be 4 pg mL1 for SERS assay using COVID-19
antigen. Next, we determined the selectivity of the SERS assay
for the identication of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike
antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles.
For this purpose, we also performed the same SERS experiment
for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen separately
using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold
nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 3E, we did not observe any SERS
intensity change even when 1 ng mL1 SARS-CoV antigen or
MERS-CoV antigen was added to anti-spike antibody and 4-
aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. The above re-
ported data clearly show that antibody attached GNP-based
SERS is highly selective for COVID-19 spike antigen.
Our SERS-based diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-
spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nano-
particles is based on the fact that in the presence of pseudo
SARS-CoV-2, owing to the virus spike protein–antibody inter-
action, anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached
gold nanoparticles aggregate on the surface of the virus, as
shown in Fig. 2B and C. Since the size of the pseudo SARS-CoV-2
is around 120–150 nm, several anti-spike antibody and 4-ami-
nothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles can aggregate on the
surface of each virus particle and form several “hot spots”. As
a result, as shown in Fig. 3F, we observed a huge SERS intensity
change, which is due to the surface plasmon coupling between
anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold
nanoparticles. Our reported SERS diagnosis of pseudo SARS-
CoV-2
using
anti-spike
antibody
and
4-aminothiophenol
attached gold nanoparticles is very quick: it takes less than 5
minutes to get the results.
To determine the sensitivity of SERS assay for the identi-
cation of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody and 4-
aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, we performed
a virus concentration dependence study using from 10 to 1500
pseudo SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. As shown in Fig. 3F, SERS
assay can be used for the diagnosis of the minimum concen-
tration of 10 virus particles per mL, where we observed a more
than 2-fold increment of the Raman signal. Fig. 3G shows how
the Raman signal at 1078 cm1 from anti-spike antibody and 4-
aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles varies with the
concentration of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Using eqn (1) and the
concentration-dependent linear plot shown in Fig. 3G, we esti-
mated the LOD to be 18 virus particles per mL for SERS assay
using pseudo SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of our reported SERS
detection assay is comparable with the Abbott Real Time SARS-
CoV-2 RT-PCR assay (40 copies per mL).44
Inhibition of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody
attached gold nanoparticles
It is now well documented that SARS-CoV-2 fusion with host cell
membranes proceeds through interactions between spike
proteins of the virus and the ACE2 receptor on the surface of
human cells.5–16,34–41 To nd out whether anti-spike antibody
attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to block entry of
the virus into cells, we used pseudo SARS-CoV-2 (# C1110G,
Montana Molecular, Bozeman, MT) as the model virus.36–38 For
our inhibition experiment we used HEK293T cells, which
express ACE2, by which SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells is
determined.36–38 As shown in Fig. 4A–C, anti-spike antibody
attached gold nanoparticles block viral replication and virus
spread in HEK293T cells. Our data show that the inhibition
eﬃciency was 100% for 100 ng mL1 anti-spike antibody
attached gold nanoparticles and 60% for 10 ng mL1 anti-spike
antibody attached GNPs. In contrast, our experimental data
indicate that the inhibition eﬃciencies for PEG coated GNPs
and 100 ng mL1 antibody only were very low, less than 1%.
Thus, for the design of anti-spike antibody GNPs we used 100 ng
mL1 antibody, since our data indicated 100% inhibition eﬃ-
ciency in the presence of 100 ng mL1 anti-spike-antibody
attached gold nanoparticles.
The inhibition is possibly due to antibody attached gold
nanoparticles
binding
to
pseudo
SARS-CoV-2,
thereby
inhibiting the virus from binding to the cell receptor,14,34–41
and as a result, preventing the virus from infecting the tar-
geted cells.34–41 But also, as shown in Fig. 4D, antibody
attached GNPs have the capability to break the lipid
membrane of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, so that the virus particle
collapses.34–41 And, as we and others have reported before,
gold nanoparticles suppress viral infection by selectively
cleaving disulde bonds, which blocks membrane fusion
and viral entry to the host cell.14,34,35,38–41 We believe that all
the above discussed mechanisms are responsible for the
100% inhibition eﬃciency observed using the anti-spike
antibody attached gold nanoparticles.

Conclusions
We have developed novel anti-spike antibody attached gold
nanoparticles for rapid virus diagnosis and inhibition. Our re-
ported data demonstrate that antibody attached GNPs can be
used for the naked eye detection of specic COVID-19 viral
antigen or of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 via a simple colorimetric
change. Our experimental data show that anti-spike antibody
attached gold nanoparticle-based sensing of COVID-19 viral
antigen or virus is very fast: they can be detected within a 5
minute time period. Our results show that a naked eye assay
allows the presence of antigen or virus to be determined even at
a concentration of 1 ng mL1 for COVID-19 antigen and 1000
virus particles per mL for pseudo SARS-CoV-2. We have also
demonstrated that, using anti-spike antibody and 4-amino-
thiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS, COVID-19
viral antigen or virus at very low concentrations can be diag-
nosed within 5 minutes. Our reported data show that, using
a portable
Raman
analyzer, our antibody
and 4-amino-
thiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has
the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen, even at a concentra-
tion of 4 pg mL1 and virus at a concentration of 18 virus
particles per mL. Our reported nite-diﬀerence time-domain
(FDTD)
simulation
data
indicate
a 4-orders-of-magnitude
Raman enhancement occurs in “hot spot” positions when
gold nanoparticles formed aggregates.
Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), by means of which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry
into human cells, we demonstrated that anti-spike antibody
attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to control viral
infection. Our reported data show that the inhibition eﬃciency
is 100% for anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. On
the other hand, for GNPs alone the inhibition eﬃciency is only
around 1% and for 100 ng mL1 antibody the inhibition eﬃ-
ciency is less than 1%. That our reported data indicate 100%
inhibition eﬃciency in the presence of anti-spike antibody
attached gold nanoparticles may be due to the fact that antibody
attached gold nanoparticles bind to pseudo SARS-CoV-2,
thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors.
Our data show that antibody attached GNPs block viral repli-
cation and virus spread in HEK293T cells. They also destroy the
virus lipid membrane.
