ABSTRACT
In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space
Station (ISS), several Sphingomonas strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene
sequence, phylogenetic analysis identiﬁed the ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis
(n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to
assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as Sphingomonas paucimobilis.
Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identiﬁed 23 Sphingomonas
species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for S. sanguinis in
the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-
assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its com-
parison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates
revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these
Sphingomonas strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate
genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS com-
parison of these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp. LK11, an arid de-
sert strain, identiﬁed several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones
and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid,
was further conﬁrmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were
conserved across all the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore,
genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock
response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to
be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Characterizing
these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing
their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space mis-
sions in the future.
IMPORTANCE Sphingomonas is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically
contaminated extreme environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have
been identiﬁed as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study
describes the isolation and identiﬁcation of Sphingomonas members from the ISS,
which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial
production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond
low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohor-
mone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal
resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identiﬁed, rendering the
ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.

KEYWORDS Sphingomonas, International Space Station, phytohormones, plant growth
promotion
S
phingomonas species are found in a variety of habitats, including soil, marine sedi-
ments, wastewater, and freshwater, in addition to the habitats contaminated with
dyes, herbicides, and other pollutants (1–3). They possess diverse catabolic capabilities;
for instance, assimilation of different types of complex sugars, including polysaccha-
rides, was reported (2). Some species are tolerant to copper, resulting in bioﬁlm forma-
tion and eventually surface corrosion (4), and some aid in herbicide mineralization or
degradation of pollutants (5–7). Sphingomonas paucimobilis has been isolated from the
International Space Station (ISS) potable drinking water (8), ISS surfaces (9), and hospi-
tal clinical specimens and is known to cause rare infections in immunocompromised
individuals (2, 10, 11).
Recent reports have identiﬁed the role of some Sphingomonas species in plant
growth promotion (5, 12–14). Microorganisms aid in plant growth promotion via differ-
ent mechanisms, including secreting metabolites like phytohormones, solubilizing
phosphate, ﬁxating nitrogen, inducing stress response pathways, or acting as biocon-
trol agents (5, 14–19). Phytohormones play a signiﬁcant role in plant metabolism and
defense mechanisms (20). For instance, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is responsible for pro-
moting cell division, elongation, and differentiation (21) and is involved in a wide range
of plant processes ranging from responses to light and gravity to heavy metal stress
tolerance (22, 23). Recent studies have detailed the role of Sphingomonas species in
plant growth promotion via the production of phytohormones and increased stress
tolerance. S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 produces phytohormones like IAA, salicylic acid, zeatin,
and abscisic acid and helps in nitrogen ﬁxation (14). Sphingomonas sp. LK11, isolated
from the leaves of the arid medicinal plant Tephrosia apollinea, was shown to produce
auxins and gibberellins and was reported to increase stress tolerance to salinity and
cadmium in tomato plants (12, 15, 24). In addition, genomic analysis of Sphingomonas
sp. LK11 also revealed genes for hydrogen peroxide production that enhance plant
growth, seed germination, and root colonization, genes for phosphate uptake, osmotic
stress, and heavy metal stress (15). Genomic analysis of Sphingomonas panacis DCY99T
isolated from the roots of Panax ginseng identiﬁed genes for IAA production, phos-
phate solubilization, heavy metal stress tolerance, and degradation of phenolic com-
pounds (5). Furthermore, Sphingomonas sp. Cra20 was shown to improve plant growth
under drought stress conditions by altering the rhizosphere microbial community (13).
The ability of microorganisms to produce phytohormones thus offers the potential to
manipulate plant growth and development but without the need to supplement hor-
mones externally to the plants.
In an ongoing microbial tracking experiment on the ISS, several microbial strains
belonging to Sphingomonas sanguinis (n = 2) were isolated from the ISS, and a third
strain identiﬁed as S. paucimobilis was cultured from the Kennedy Space Center, Payload
Hazardous Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF). After the isolation of Sphingomonas strains from
the ISS (25, 26), a complete genome (;4.4 Mbp) was also assembled from the shotgun
reads retrieved from the same ISS environmental surface (26), resulting in the production
of a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) belonging to S. sanguinis. Given the per-
sistence of Sphingomonas bacteria among spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces, and a growing
body of evidence for Sphingomonas strains to promote plant growth, this study applies
comparative genomic analyses to identify genetic determinants that relate to plant
growth-promoting features (PGPF) and highlights those that may be adaptive to growth
on spaceﬂight-relevant environments and surfaces. Our ﬁndings report the presence of
several determinants for the production of plant phytohormones, including several gene
products promoting resistance to sources of abiotic stress, with emphasis on oxidative/
osmotic stress resistance, heavy metal tolerance, and adaptation to sources of radiation.
Further, the production of a phytohormone, IAA, by these isolates was conﬁrmed using
metabolomics. Moreover, intersection analysis of functional annotations and orthologous

groups from the Sphingomonas species from spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces (KSC-PHSF, ISS)
revealed potential differences in gene contents involved in the horizontal gene transfer
that are notably absent in their respective type strains. Taken together, our results show
how characterization of microorganisms with respect to their ability to promote plant
growth, including vegetables that can be used as a food source, will contribute to the de-
velopment of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future.
RESULTS
Abundance of Sphingomonas species in the ISS. Among the cultivable bacteria,
three colonies obtained from ISS surfaces (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5) and one from KSC
(FKI-L5-BR-P1) were identiﬁed as Sphingomonas species. All ISS strains were S. sanguinis,
and the KSC strain was S. paucimobilis. The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and the
draft genomes assembled were further used to conﬁrm the identity of the species based
on average nucleotide identity (ANI; Table 1), which was calculated to be ;99% with the
nearest type strain. Genomic characteristics and other details of the annotation are given
in Table 1. The metagenomic data analysis identiﬁed 23 Sphingomonas species from
ﬂight 2, all of which were isolated from location 7, that is, a panel near the portable
water dispenser (LAB) (Fig. 1). In addition, the reads obtained from ﬂight 1 belonging to
a single species, Sphingomonas sanxanigenens, were also seen in samples from ﬂights 2
and 3 (Fig. 1). However, its location on the ISS varied across different ﬂights. Reads
obtained from ﬂight 3 also showed the presence of S. paucimobilis from location 4, that
is, the dining table (node 1). The metagenomic reads thus obtained from the ISS show
that Sphingomonas species persisted across all three ﬂights, with S. sanguinis being
abundant among all Sphingomonas species in ﬂight 2. Furthermore, the MAG sequence
(ISS-IIF7SWP) exhibited .99.6% ANI with the type strain of S. sanguinis (Table 1). The
MAG was derived from the exact location on the ISS where S. sanguinis isolates IIF7SW-
B3A and IIF7SW-B5 were retrieved using cultivation techniques. It was also conﬁrmed
that the MAG genome had .99% ANI value with the genomes of the S. sanguinis strains
isolated from the ISS. The use of the culture-dependent and -independent methods thus
conﬁrms the presence of S. sanguinis on the ISS.
Plant growth-promoting features in Sphingomonas species isolated from
spaceﬂight environments. BLAST-based genome comparisons visualized using BLAST
Ring Image Generator (BRIG) revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across
each spaceﬂight genome and their type strains compared against the Sphingomonas
sp. LK11 genome (Fig. 2). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each S. sanguinis
(66.1 to 66.2%) and S. paucimobilis (65.5%) genome were highly similar to that of LK11
(66.09%). Subsequent pangenome comparisons conducted by Anvi’o revealed a sub-
stantial core genome and further support both shared nucleotide and functional iden-
tity among these spaceﬂight Sphingomonas genomes, their type strains, and the endo-
phyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (Fig. 3).
Due to the high degree of functional identity shared between each of the space
Sphingomonas species and Sphingomonas sp. LK11, functional annotations for each of
the spaceﬂight Sphingomonas genomes and their type strains were conducted to iden-
tify putative PGPF. Functional analysis of these outputs revealed that many PGPFs pro-
posed for Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (15) are likely also present in the analyzed S. sanguinis
and S. paucimobilis genomes. Annotations reported from the EggNOGv5 database sug-
gest that several gene products proposed to promote phosphate and sulfur assimilation
in plants are also present in these select Sphingomonas strains, albeit with some species-
speciﬁc patterns. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake metabolism and solubili-
zation in soil appear to be conserved across all the selected S. paucimobilis and S. sangui-
nis strains; however, gene products associated with sulfate/thiosulfate and hydrogen
production may be exclusive to the selected S. sanguinis strains. Furthermore, several
pathways proposed to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including the heat/cold
shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance,
appear to be shared between these selected S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis genomes.
Previous reports suggested that responses to oxidative stress in Sphingomonas sp.

LK11 may promote plant host tolerance to abiotic stress via the amelioration of reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS) (12, 15, 27). Therefore, speciﬁc gene products related to oxi-
dative stress resistance in space-associated Sphingomonas strains were further identi-
ﬁed. Analysis of annotations generated by PGAP and eggNOG-MapperV2 suggested
that space-associated Sphingomonas strains harbor multiple copies of several classes
of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, gluta-
thione S-transferases, and glutaredoxins. Next, we sought to identify metabolic path-
ways suggested to reduce the abundance of ROS, for instance, carotenoids, which are
known for their antioxidant activity (28). Examination of PGAP and eggNOG annota-
tions suggest that all Sphingomonas strains analyzed in this study possess the genetic
repertoire (crtB, crtI, crtY, crtZ) to produce the carotenoid zeaxanthin from the precursor
geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (Fig. 4A). Further analysis also revealed the pres-
ence of an unnamed sterol desaturase family protein, often proximate to these gene
clusters, which shared high identity to the crtG gene product identiﬁed in
Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 (74% to 75% identity) (29). CrtG converts zeaxanthin
to produce the yellow pigment nostoxanthin, a common carotenoid produced by
Sphingomonas (30). Likewise, two pathways for the production of the nonreducing di-
saccharide trehalose were also identiﬁed in both the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis
strains. Trehalose serves a variety of functions across organisms, acting as a carbon
source, a compatible solute, and a metabolite that provides protection against a vari-
ety of abiotic stressors (31). These results suggest that Sphingomonas strains can
potentially synthesize trehalose from the otsA/B pathway, wherein a two-step mecha-
nism catalyzes the formation of trehalose 6-phosphate from the condensation of glu-
cose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose residues (otsA) and subsequent dephosphorylation
of trehalose 6-phosphate into the disaccharide trehalose (otsB). Additionally, trehalose
could also be produced in these bacteria through catabolism of a(1,4) glucose poly-
mers into trehalose via the treY/Z pathway (Fig. 4B).
These ﬁndings suggest that the tested Sphingomonas species, including the strains
sequenced from spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces, contain several pathways likely to confer
resistance to a variety of abiotic stressors, especially with respect to several antioxidant

enzymes and metabolites. The presence of these features supports the potential role
of these newly sequenced Sphingomonas strains to promote plant growth and increase
plant stress tolerance.
Indole-3-acetic acid production by S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains
isolated from the ISS. One of the sources of IAA biosynthesis is the amino acid trypto-
phan, and analysis of the orthologous groups identiﬁed by the eggNOGv5 database
suggested that the selected Sphingomonas strains possess the required tryptophan
biosynthesis genes (trpA,B,C,D,E,F), consistent with observations from previous reports
in the literature (5, 15). Leveraging the inclusion of several KEGG orthologs, enzyme
classes, and KEGG reactions outputs via eggNOG-MapperV2, potential pathways for
these Sphingomonas to synthesize IAA from tryptophan are proposed (Fig. 4C).
Analysis of the functional annotations transferred from the EggNOGv5 database
pointed to a group of carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family proteins that may act as puta-
tive nitrilases (E.C 3.5.5.1), converting indole-3-acetonitrile directly to IAA. Similarly,
each of the analyzed Sphingomonas strains harbors a ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide
(FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase (putative monoamine oxidase EC 1.4.3.4), which
likely promotes the conversion of tryptamine into indole-3-acetaldehyde. However,
subsequent steps allowing the conversion of indole-3-acetaldehyde to IAA via an
unnamed aldehyde dehydrogenase family protein (EC 1.2.1.3) were exclusive to the

Subsequent rings illustrate the percent identity of the selected Sphingomonas genomes calculated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%,

analyzed S. paucimobilis genomes. Further, the presence of indole-pyruvate ferredoxin,
an enzyme which is responsible for the conversion of indole-3-pyruvate into S-2-
(indol-3-yl)acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), was also exclusive to S. paucimobilis; how-
ever, it is unclear as to how S. paucimobilis may further alter S-2-(indol-3-yl)acetyl-CoA
into IAA. While two putative mechanisms across both S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis
that may directly yield IAA from tryptophan-derived metabolites are supported by the
results of functional annotation, we failed to identify canonical mechanisms for the for-
mation of the upstream reactants in tryptophan metabolism, suggesting that novel
mechanisms for IAA formation may occur in Sphingomonas and species-dependent
FIG 3 Pangenome analysis of S. sanguinis, S. paucimobilis genomes obtained from space-relevant surfaces with their type
strains, and Sphingomonas sp. LK11, generated by the Anvi’o software. Primary functional annotation in Anvi’o was
conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene
clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command (–num-threads 2, –mcl-inﬂation 6, –min-bit 0.5,
–use-ncbi-blast). Ordering of the pangenome display was determined using a Euclidean distance clustering algorithm and
the provided ward linkage method. Beginning from the innermost ring and moving outward, rings 1 to 8 correspond to
gene clusters identiﬁed in each of the analyzed Sphingomonas genomes in the following order: 1, Sphingomonas sp. LK11;
2, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1; 3, Sphingomonas LCT-SP1; 4, S. paucimobilis NCTC 11030T; 5, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A; 6, S.
sanguinis IIF7SW-B5; 7, S. sanguinis ISS-IIF7SWP (MAG); 8, S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T. Ring 9 shows a density plot of the
number of genes within the identiﬁed gene clusters, and ring 10 highlights single-copy gene clusters (black). Rings 11 and
12 correspond to the geometric homogeneity index and functional homogeneity indices of similarity, with the former
accounting for gaps in alignments, while the latter scores functional similarities by residue within the aligned sequences.
The outermost ring represents the location of known Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) functional categories. The
right-most bar chart corresponds to the number of singleton gene clusters, number of gene clusters, number of genes,

pathways may supplement a shared metabolic pathway. Interestingly, while an auxin
export carrier family protein was identiﬁed in each of the analyzed S. paucimobilis
genomes, no such protein was identiﬁed in S. sanguinis.
Since the genomic analysis of the spaceﬂight isolates revealed genetic signatures for
the production of several plant growth-promoting hormones, metabolomic characteriza-
tion was carried out to identify the phytohormone IAA. All Sphingomonas isolates
obtained from spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces were cultured in the presence of tryptophan,
and metabolites extracted from the culture ﬁltrate were analyzed using high-perform-
ance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS).
The MS data analysis showed the presence of IAA among the metabolites extracted
from all three strains, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, and S. paucimobilis
FKI-L5-BR-P1 (Fig. 5A). The production of IAA (molecular weight, M = 175.18 g/mol) by
these isolates was conﬁrmed by comparing the electrospray ionization mass spectrome-
try (ESI-MS) proﬁle (positive mode: M1H = ;176 g/mol) of IAA standard with culture
extracts, either alone or mixed with IAA standard (Fig. 5A). The ESI-MS proﬁle of all the
three culture extracts was found to be comparable with the standard. Further, the pro-
duction of IAA was validated by tandem mass spectrometry to generate a mass fragmen-
tation proﬁle in positive mode, corresponding to M1H of ;176 g/mol. The three culture
extracts resulted in a fragmentation pattern that was similar to the IAA standard, gener-
ating three different fragments, including a parent ion of ;176 g/mol (Fig. 5B). In con-
trast, the presence of IAA was not observed in nutrient media without tryptophan (data
not shown). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data also revealed the
presence of few other metabolites with molecular weights similar to those of other phy-
tohormones; however, their positive identiﬁcation will require further analysis, which is
outside the scope of this study.
Functional differences between ISS Sphingomonas isolates and their type
strains. Analysis of plant growth-promoting features suggested the potential for con-
served functional characteristics between the spaceﬂight and type strains of S. paucimobilis
and S. sanguinis genomes but with some distinctions. Therefore, functional differences
were further explored through hierarchical clustering of the relative abundance of func-
tional categories assigned by the eggNOG database (Fig. 6). Intriguingly, the selected

of the otsA/B pathway, a condensation reaction between glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose synthesizes trehalose 6-phosphate (otsA). Second, a
dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate catalyzed by otsB yields the product trehalose. Additionally, trehalose can also be formed from the
rearrangement of the a(1,4) glycosidic bonds of glucose polymers to a(1) glycosidic bonds via treY, allowing for the hydrolysis of the terminal trehalose

Sphingomonas genomes clustered primarily according to the environment in which they
were sampled (terrestrial type strains versus spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces at KSC and the
ISS) and then clustered according to their species assignment. Examining the relative
abundance of each of the assigned functional categories, it is clear that a sizeable portion
(;20% to 21%) of each of these selected Sphingomonas genomes lack known functional
roles, highlighting novel gene products that are ripe for future bioinformatics and molecu-
lar characterization. Yet, differences in functional products corresponding to the category
L, replication, recombination, and repair, are noticeably higher in genomes of the strains
isolated from spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces.
Protein-level differences between the Sphingomonas strains obtained from space-
ﬂight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains are shown in Fig. 7A and Table
S1. Intersection analysis was performed using UpsetR for the presence and absence of
named protein products across each genome (Fig. 7B). Here, 1,488 named proteins
were shared among all of the selected spaceﬂight-relevant Sphingomonas genomes
and their respective type strains. In contrast, 71 named orthologous proteins were
unique to the S. paucimobilis strains isolated from spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces, and an
analogous 53 named orthologous proteins were found to be unique to S. sanguinis
spaceﬂight strains. However, a sizable portion of the proteomes for each of these
genomes lacked predicted protein names to use as unique terms for intersection anal-
ysis. Thus, a custom pileup was performed that grouped entries into unique keys con-
sisting of common predicted taxa, predicted protein names, the eggNOG free text

compared across multiple genomes. While this method enhanced comparisons of
unnamed protein groups identiﬁed by eggNOGv5, precaution should be taken when
comparing the results, as different seed orthologs appear to transfer slightly different
descriptions; however, such an analysis greatly improved functional insights that
would not have been captured via analysis of KEGG Orthology (KO) or named proteins
alone. Analysis of the KO assigned by eggNOGv5 revealed that gene clusters associ-
ated with rhamnose metabolism, type IV secretion (trb operon), conjugal transfer pilus
assembly proteins (tra operon), and heavy metal resistance genes are present in each
of the spaceﬂight S. sanguinis strains and are notably absent from the type strain S.
sanguinis NBRC 13937T. While S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T is not a complete genome, the
ability to capture the presence or components of large biosynthetic clusters or operons
is conducive to the assemblies’ N50 of 61,922 bp across 134 contigs of total length

4,053,092 bp. Similar patterns of differences in type IV secretion apparatus, conjugal
transfer proteins, and rhamnose metabolism were also observed for the spaceﬂight-rel-
evant surface strains from S. paucimobilis compared to those of their type strains, albeit
to a lesser extent than the patterns reported for S. sanguinis. Further unique gene
products identiﬁed in S. paucimobilis include a suite of multidrug efﬂux proteins, DNA
repair proteins (dinJ and sbcD), catechol metabolism (catABC), genes involved in quo-
rum sensing via homoserine lactone synthesis and export, and the natural transforma-
tion protein comEA. Both S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis spaceﬂight isolates also
showed the presence of genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of industrially im-
portant metabolites, including antibiotics (erythromycin and vancomycin) and anti-
cancer compounds (betalains). Overall, our results point to functional differences in
these spaceﬂight-relevant S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis genomes compared to their
respective type strains, many of which may provide adaptive advantages for survival
during spaceﬂight or on spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces.
DISCUSSION
This study shows the identiﬁcation of putative PGPFs in Sphingomonas strains iso-
lated from the ISS or in a cleanroom where spacecraft are assembled. The features
involved in the plant growth promotion were identiﬁed based on comparative genomic
analysis with a well-characterized endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11. Such comparative
genomic analysis of the S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, S. sanguinis
ISS-IIF7SWP, and S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 spaceﬂight genomes, along with their re-
spective type strains, showed substantial genomic similarity to Sphingomonas sp. LK11,
evidenced by high nucleotide identity and a large core genome shared among these
bacteria. Leveraging extensive annotation provided by the eggNOG-MapperV2 software,
PGPFs described previously for Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (14) were largely consistent with
the results of comparative analysis conducted in this study. While minor species-speciﬁc
differences in sulfur assimilation and hydrogen sulﬁde production were identiﬁed in S.
sanguinis, all genomes shared similar putative PGPFs. Speciﬁcally, genomic analysis high-
lighted the presence of several enzyme classes that participate in ROS metabolism which
appear to be present in multiple copies across each of the selected Sphingomonas
genomes.
In addition, analysis of metabolic pathways of spaceﬂight Sphingomonas strains also
suggested that each strain is likely capable of producing the carotenoids zeaxanthin and
nostoxanthin. Zeaxanthin has been suggested to play a number of roles in both bacteria
and plants, including photoprotection, detoxiﬁcation of ROS, and resistance to ionizing
radiation (32). Indeed, high levels of zeaxanthin production in the bacterium Paracoccus
zeaxanthinifaciens were shown to promote resistance to ionizing, UV radiation, and
hydrogen peroxide; however, resistance among the select Sphingomonas strains was
weaker than that among P. zeaxanthinifaciens (33). Additionally, zeaxanthin also serves as
a metabolic precursor for the formation of the plant phytohormone abscisic acid, prompt-
ing speculation that zeaxanthin-producing, plant-associated microbes may promote plant
growth by supplying plant hosts with carotenoid derivatives such as zeaxanthin (34).
Further evidence for producing plant-relevant metabolites that confer antioxidant
activity was also supported by the identiﬁcation of the otsA/B and treY/Z pathways in
each of the spaceﬂight Sphingomonas strains, strongly suggesting that these bacteria
produce the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose. These results are in agreement with
the identiﬁcation of the otsA/B and treY/Z pathways in Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (15), as
well as with previous work demonstrating that soybean plants inoculated with
Sphingomonas sp. LK11, with and without exogenous trehalose, improved plant
growth and stress tolerance under drought stress conditions induced via polyethylene
glycol treatment (27). Likewise, transgenic introduction of the Escherichia coli otsA/B
pathway in rice plant recipients yielded enhanced plant resistance to abiotic stress
(35). In addition to promoting abiotic stress resistance in plants, trehalose production
likely serves as an antioxidant against oxidative stress in microbes, conferring

resistance to hydrogen peroxide, and oxidative damage to proteins and lipids induced
by ROS (36, 37). Due to its role as both an antioxidant and signaling molecule, trehalose
production also elicits protective effects against sources of ionizing radiation (38–40).
Overall, these results strongly suggest that gene products identiﬁed across these
spaceﬂight Sphingomonas strains support a model proposed for Sphingomonas sp. LK11
(a strain isolated from a desert plant), wherein excessive ROS produced by plant hosts is
ameliorated through oxidative stress response pathways deployed by Sphingomonas
strains, thereby increasing plant stress tolerance to abiotic environments (15). In addi-
tion, many of these ROS-metabolizing gene products discussed in the context of plant
abiotic stress also contribute to increased resistance against ionizing radiation. Given evi-
dence of oxidative stress responses deployed by microbial systems during spaceﬂight
(41), and increased exposure to sources of ionizing radiation in extraterrestrial environ-
ments, we speculate that many of the discussed PGPFs likely present in spaceﬂight S.
sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains may be advantageous to their survival in the space-
ﬂight environment.
Alongside several putative PGPFs, the genomic analysis suggested that IAA may be
produced through three separate pathways in these organisms, albeit with some species-
speciﬁc reactions. While all the space S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains shared annota-
tions for the conversion of indole-3-acetonitrile into IAA via a putative nitrilase enzyme,
the production of IAA from the oxidation of indole-3-acetaldehyde via an unnamed alde-
hyde dehydrogenase family protein was absent in the spaceﬂight S. sanguinis strains. Yet,
all S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains may also produce indole-3-acetaldehyde from
tryptamine, catalyzed by a monoamine oxidase enzyme. While functional analyses have
proposed putative downstream reaction mechanisms to produce IAA, many of the
upstream reaction pathways lack a well-characterized mechanism of action via known
gene products or enzyme classes. Consistent with this study, not all genes involved in IAA
biosynthesis were found in the genomes of S. panacis DCY99T and Sphingomonas sp. LK11
(5, 15), indicating that a novel pathway for IAA production in Sphingomonas strains is yet
to be elucidated. Subsequent LC-MS analysis conﬁrmed that each of the space S. sanguinis
and S. paucimobilis isolates produced IAA, however, only when their growth medium was
supplemented with tryptophan. The results obtained agree with other studies that have
reported the production of IAA in Sphingomonas strains but, again, only in the presence of
tryptophan in growth media (5, 12). In addition to the role of zeaxanthin and other plant
metabolites in providing tolerance to certain stress conditions, IAA has also been reported
to regulate several stress-related genes in Escherichia coli via accumulation of DnaK chaper-
one and trehalose (42). Some other studies have also reported an increase in trehalose
accumulation upon exposure to IAA and found those cells to be more resistant to cold
shock (43, 44). The chaperone DnaK has also been shown to protect E. coli from oxidative
damage by preventing protein aggregation (45). This observation indicates that the pro-
duction of IAA by space Sphingomonas strains might indirectly contribute to stress toler-
ance in the associated plants via similar mechanisms. Future applications of metabolomic
and transcriptomic analyses under space or simulated microgravity conditions will likely
be prudent for identifying patterns of metabolic ﬂux in response to tryptophan supple-
mentation, thereby elucidating potential mechanisms for IAA production in these bacteria.
Prompted by differences in functional compositions between Sphingomonas strains
obtained from spaceﬂight-relevant surfaces (KSC, ISS, Shengzhou Rocket X), intersec-
tional analysis of orthologous groups of spaceﬂight-relevant genomes against their
type strains was performed. Analysis of KEGG-associated annotations provided by
eggNOGv5 showed the presence of several genes in space-related Sphingomonas iso-
lates that were not otherwise found in their respective type strains. S. sanguinis space-
ﬂight isolates showed the presence of tra genes involved in pilus assembly and conju-
gal transfer (traF, trbC, traU, traW, trbI, traC, traV, traB, traK, traE, traL, and traH) and
those involved in mating pair stabilization (traG and traN), which were absent in the
type strain (46). Some groups have previously reported the occurrence of conjugal
transfer in bacteria under microgravity conditions (47–49). Therefore, the presence of

tra genes in S. sanguinis spaceﬂight isolates indicates the existence of conjugal transfer
under space conditions that might also be responsible for acquiring genetic materials
from related bacterial species.
In addition, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 showed the presence of genes involved in
quorum sensing: lasI (acyl-homoserine lactone synthase), acyl-homoserine lactones
(AHLs) biosynthesis, and LuxR family transcriptional regulator. AHLs act as signaling
molecules through which LuxR regulates the expression of a number of genes, some
of which are potentially associated with virulence (50). AntiSMASH analysis of S. pauci-
mobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 spaceﬂight isolate also showed the presence of a gene cluster
(region 6.1; Fig. S1) involved in the synthesis of a homoserine lactone (Hserlactone).
Further, KEGG analysis also showed the presence of some genes involved in the pro-
duction of industrially important metabolites in the spaceﬂight isolates. For instance, both
S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis spaceﬂight isolates showed the presence of modules asso-
ciated with the biosynthesis of antibiotics like erythromycin A/B and vancomycin, which
were absent in the type strains. Another important pathway that was highlighted in these
spaceﬂight isolates is the betalain biosynthesis pathway and the presence of gene 4,5-
DOPA dioxygenase extradiol. The enzyme dioxygenase extradiol is involved in opening
the cyclic ring of dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA), resulting in the formation of an unsta-
ble seco-DOPA that further rearranges to form betalamic acid, the structural unit of beta-
lains (51). Betalains are known to be majorly produced by Caryophyllales plants (e.g., the
red and yellow pigments found in beets) and some fungal species; however, one bacterial
species, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, was recently reported to produce betalains (52).
They are known to have antioxidant activity, are reported to be effective against some can-
cer cells, and also promote anti-inﬂammatory response (53–55).
In addition, KEGG Orthology analysis indicated the presence of some genes in S.
sanguinis spaceﬂight isolates that may have been acquired to help them survive the
use of antibiotics, as noted by multiple studies of other microbial species on the ISS
(26, 56–59). For instance, the mercury resistance operon present in some bacteria con-
tains mostly three genes: merR (transcriptional regulator), merT (inner membrane mer-
cury scavenging protein), and merP (periplasmic mercury scavenging protein) (60),
which were also found in S. sanguinis spaceﬂight and type strains. In addition to these
three genes, the spaceﬂight-relevant isolates also showed the presence of merB (alkyl-
mercury lyase), merE (mercuric ion transport protein), and merD (MerR family transcrip-
tional regulator, mercuric resistance operon regulatory protein), which are not present
in all bacteria containing the operon. Previous studies have reported that several mer
genes (merD and merE) were more likely to be encoded on plasmids or transposons
and, therefore, can be transferred via horizontal gene transfer (61), which might also
be the case for S. sanguinis spaceﬂight isolates. S. sanguinis spaceﬂight isolates also
contained gene rcnA, belonging to nickel/cobalt transporter family protein.
Conclusions. This study utilized comparative genomics and identiﬁed a plethora of
factors in Sphingomonas present in spaceﬂight environments that may result in the pro-
duction of several PGPFs and aid in the growth of plants. The production of one of the
phytohormones IAA was also conﬁrmed using metabolomics. These space Sphingomonas
strains, along with other plant growth-promoting strains of microbes isolated from the ISS
(62), therefore, hold great potential to contribute to space exploration through promoting
and controlling plant growth as part of an integrated bio-regenerative life support system
enabling future extended-duration crewed missions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection and whole-genome sequence analysis. Sample collection and processing, fol-
lowed by WGS and assembly that led to the isolation of Sphingomonas strains, are described elsewhere
(25, 63). Samples collected across different locations on the ISS, and the KSC-PHSF cleanroom, were
plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) to culture different bacterial colonies (25). In addition to cultivation,
previously published metagenomic sequences sampled from ISS locations were downloaded from NCBI
(26) and analyzed for the presence of Sphingomonas species, and MAGs were generated.
DNA extraction was followed by metagenomic sequencing and assembly as described previously
(26). Identiﬁcation of Sphingomonas spp. from metagenomic assembly was performed as described

elsewhere (59). In the case of S. sanguinis genome assembled from the metagenome, sample collection,
processing, and DNA extraction were carried out as reported previously (26). The assembled draft
genomes were annotated using NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) 4.11 (64, 65). The
identity of the strains was conﬁrmed based on ANI calculated using EZBioCloud (66).
Genome annotation. To further explore potential functional differences between spaceﬂight iso-
lates and their respective type strains, we obtained coding sequences from the NCBI RefSeq database
and, where applicable, performed additional annotation through the online eggNOG-mapperV2 web
server using the default settings (67, 68). The coding sequences of the metagenome-assembled genome
of S. sanguinis ISS-IIF7SWP were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. Coding nucleotide sequen-
ces for each Sphingomonas genome along with their respective type strains were annotated using the
online eggNOG-MapperV2 software, whose column-based outputs were parsed and compared on a per-
genome basis using a custom python script (available for use via https://github.com/jlombo96/
Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook). Preliminary annotations of these select spaceﬂight isolates high-
lighted potential connections to the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11, a strain well characterized
with respect to its plant growth-promoting capabilities (12, 15, 24, 27, 69). Given the presence of a thor-
oughly annotated and complete genome sequence (15), robust evidence for the production of the plant
phytohormones gibberellic acid (GA) and IAA (12, 15), and previous use as a model for novel plant-asso-
ciated Sphingomonas genomes (5), Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was selected as a reference genome to iden-
tify putative plant growth-promoting features in other Sphingomonas genomes. In this study, the endo-
phyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11, two S. sanguinis isolates (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5), and one S. sanguinis
MAG (ISS-IIF7SWP) sampled from the ISS, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 cultured from KSC-PHSF, and S.
paucimobilis LCT-SP1 isolated from the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou X were compared against their re-
spective type strains: S. sanguinis NBRC 13937T and S. paucimobilis NCTC 11030T.
Metabolite extraction and analysis. Previous reports have characterized the phytohormone pro-
duction capability of several Sphingomonas species, including Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (11), S. panacis
DCY99T (5), and S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 (14). While both S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 and Sphingomonas sp. LK11
were conﬁrmed to produce the plant phytohormone IAA, the deﬁnitive chemical pathway responsible
for their production is yet to be elucidated (12, 14, 15). Therefore, the potential for the production of the
auxin-derivative IAA in each of the selected S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis strains was examined. The
space isolates (S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, and S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1) were
streaked on R2A (Difco, USA) and incubated at 28°C for 5 days. The strains were then inoculated in nutri-
ent broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) containing 3 g/L L-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at
28°C, 180 rpm for 7 days. To examine the phytohormones produced and secreted in culture ﬁltrate, we
pelleted the cells and extracted the metabolites from the supernatant using ethyl acetate. This step was
repeated twice. The culture supernatant was then acidiﬁed using 6N HCl and metabolites were extracted
using ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer after each step described above was transferred to a fresh
tube and evaporated in TurboVap LV. The residue obtained after drying the solvent was resuspended in
5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/95% (vol/vol) methanol at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/mL. A suitable al-
iquot of the extract (10 mL) was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis.
Stock solution of IAA standard (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was prepared in 5% DMSO/95% methanol (vol/
vol) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. It was diluted 10 times, and 10 mL of the dilution was injected for
HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. HPLC-DAD-MS was carried out using Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap
mass spectrometer with an RP C18 column (Alltech Prevail C18 3 mm 2.1 by 100 mm) at a ﬂow rate of 125
mL/min. The solvent gradient for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was 95% (vol/vol)
acetonitrile (MeCN)/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (vol/vol; solvent A), both containing 0.05% (vol/
vol) formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 30 min,
100% solvent B from 30 to 45 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 45 to 45.10 min, and reequilibration with
0% solvent B from 45.10 to 50 min.
Comparative functional analysis. Genome similarities between spaceﬂight Sphingomonas strains,
their respective type strains, and the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 were visualized using
BRIG version 0.95 with the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (chromosome and plasmids) assigned as the refer-
ence genome (70). Percent identity values for space isolates and corresponding type strains were calcu-
lated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%, upper identity cutoff: 90%).
To address potential functional differences between space isolates and their corresponding type
strains, custom Python and R scripts (https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook)
were designed to parse output annotation tables and summarize their features on a per-genome basis.
Descriptions for select KEGG IDs identiﬁed in eggNOG-MapperV2 were assigned using the BioServices
API (71). To identify protein-level differences between the Sphingomonas strains obtained from space-
ﬂight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains, custom python scripts were created to con-
struct pileup gene count tables for the annotations generated from the EggNOG-MapperV2 software.
Genes identiﬁed by eggNOG-MapperV2 for the S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis spaceﬂight isolates were
pooled on a species basis and then compared to their type strains using JVENN (72) and UpSetR (73)
using intersection analyses. Output tables generated by these analyses are displayed in Table S1.
Pangenome analysis. Pangenome analysis of the Sphingomonas space isolates, their type strains,
and the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was performed using Anvi’o v6.2 (74–76). Primary func-
tional annotation in the Anvi’o software was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and
anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via
the anvi-pan-genome command (–num-threads 2, –mcl-inﬂation 6, –min-bit 0.5, –use-ncbi-blast). The
ordering of the pangenome display was determined using Euclidean distances and ward linkage
settings.
