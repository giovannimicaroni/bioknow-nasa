ABSTRACT: The emergence of double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has
dropped vaccine eﬀectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although COVID-19 is
responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals
are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the ﬁrst time that human host defense
neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus
entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein
receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme
2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant
spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike
protein, the ﬂuorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching
data shows a nonlinear Stern−Volmer quenching proﬁle, which indicates multiple
binding sites. Using the modiﬁed Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the
eﬀective binding aﬃnity 9 nM, which is comparable with the ACE2−spike protein binding aﬃnity (8 nM). Using the alpha, beta,
and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the binding aﬃnity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those
for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs
have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the
ACE2−spike protein binding. Experimental data shows that the inhibition eﬃciency for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs are much higher than that of only one type of peptide-attached GQDs.
1. INTRODUCTION
The current global pandemic caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
responsible for over 5.4 million death till now.1−4 It is now
well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike
protein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-
RBD) facilitates the virus attachment to humans by binding to
the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the
nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which is the key path for SARS-
CoV-2 entry into human host cells.5−9 Therefore, the SARS-
CoV-2 S protein became the target for COVID-19 vaccines
available in the market, which can generate neutralizing
antibodies against the S-RBD upon immunization.9−14 The
emergence of double mutant delta (B.1.617.2) variants, which
contain the L452R and T478K mutations on the S-RBD, has
enhanced the binding aﬃnity with ACE2.1−6 Recent reports
also indicate that mutations on the S-RBD lead to a prominent
decline in neutralizing antibody levels against the delta variant
by antibodies generated during previous infection or
vaccination.7−12 Due to the above fact, designing a new
strategy to block the spike protein−ACE interaction is very
important for preventing mutate variant infection.
Although the mortality rate is very high for COVID-19,
reported data also indicates that around 42% of infected
individuals are asymptomatic carriers, which indicates that
SARS-CoV-2 can be eﬀectively controlled by the human’s
innate immune system.1−9 α-Defensin human neutrophil

defensins (HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3) as well as LL-37
(leucine-leucine-37) cathelicidin family peptides are members
of the innate immune system.11,15−17 Defensins and
cathelicidin peptides play a crucial role in the human body
for viral inhibition via binding and destabilizing.11,15−17 Driven
by the need to block the delta variant infection, herein we
report the design of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated
graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which have the capability to
bind to the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike
protein RBD and block the S-RBD interaction with ACE2,
which prevents the virus entry into the host cells, as shown in
Figure 1.
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) consisting of a graphene
lattice and containing single or few sheets of graphene
fragments exhibit size-dependent luminescence properties
originating from the quantum conﬁnement eﬀects and edge
eﬀects.18−23 GQDs containing diﬀerent surface groups such as
carboxy, epoxy, and hydroxyl exhibit a high water solubility,
high surface area, excellent photostability, and biocompati-
bility.18−23 Due to their unique optical and other properties,
GQDs became a very good choice for use in bioimaging,
biosensing, and other biotechnology applications.18−23 In our
design, bioconjugated GQD ﬂuorescence has been used to
monitor the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike
protein RBD−host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) interaction to determine the eﬀective binding aﬃnity.
Also, the functional groups on the surface and edge of GQDs
have been used for the inactivation of the virus via
decomposition of the lipid membrane of the virus and for
the removal of spike proteins that are attached on the lipid
membrane.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Synthesis and Characterization of HNP1 and LL-
37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached Graphene
Quantum Dots (GQDs). GQDs were developed in a two-step
process, as shown in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information.
Initially, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized
from natural graphite powder using the modiﬁed Hummer’s
method as we and others have reported before.18−23 In the
next step, GQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal

method in the presence of dimethyl formamide (DMF).18−23
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reported
in Figure S2A in the Supporting Information shows the two-
dimensional (2D) morphology of the freshly prepared GO
with 5 ± 2 μm size. On the other hand, the TEM image
reported in Figure S2B shows the zero-dimensional (0D)
morphology of the freshly prepared GQDs whose sizes are 4 ±
2 nm. Table S1 shows the dynamic light scattering (DLS)
measurement data, which matches well with the TEM data. As
shown in Figure 1A, for the development of HNP1 and LL-37
human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, we used
carbodiimide coupling chemistry between the carboxy group
of graphene oxides and the amine group of peptides.
The FTIR data from peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in
Figure S2G, shows the presence of the −OH stretch, −CH
stretch, −amide-I, −amide-II, and −amide-III bands, which
indicates that the peptides are attached on the GQD surfaces.
The DLS data indicates the ζ-potential changes from −14 ± 2
mV to 3 ± 1 mV after peptide binding, which also indicates
that the peptides are on the surface of GQDs. The TEM data
reported in Figure 2A indicates that the size of peptide-
conjugated GQDs are 6 ± 2 nm, which matches very well with
the DLS data reported in Table S1. The inset in Figure 2A
shows the high-resolution TEM for peptide-conjugated GQDs,
which shows the graphite structure with a stripe distance of
∼0.24 nm.18−23 Similarly, Figure S2C in the Supporting
Information shows the powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD)
pattern, which indicates a broad peak at 26.5° due to the
(002) reﬂection of graphite.18−23 Figure S2D shows the Raman
spectra of peptide-attached GQDs, which indicate the presence
of the D band at ∼1350 cm−1 and the G band at ∼1590 cm−1
due to the graphene structure.18−23
2.2. Binding Studies between the SARS-CoV-2 Delta
Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and
LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs
Using Peptide-Attached GQD-Based Luminescence. For
the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)
spike protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense
peptide-attached GQDs, we used a binding buﬀer. The
experimental details are reported in the Supporting Informa-
tion. For the detection of luminescence from HNP1 and LL-37
human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, in the presence
and absence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike
protein RBD, we used a portable ﬂuorescence spectrometer
developed by us with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode
laser.13,14,21,22 For emission signal collection, we used a
miniaturized QE65000 spectrometer from Ocean Op-
tics.13,14,21,22 All measurements were performed with 5 ms
integration time with ﬁve spectra averaging using the
software.13,14,21,22
2.3. ELISA-like Assay for Determining the Binding
between the Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein
and Peptide-Attached GQDs. For this purpose, we used an
ELISA-like assay using His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1
proteins, which were adsorbed to a 96-well plate overnight at 4
°C. For comparison with ﬂuorescence assay data, we kept the
concentrations of GQDs and spike proteins the same for both
the measurements. After that, the plate was blocked using a
blocking buﬀer and then diﬀerent concentrations of peptide-
attached GQDs were incubated on the plate. In the next step,
we used a streptavidin protein that is covalently conjugated to
a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme to determine the
binding.11−15 We also used TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzi-
dine) for colorimetric assay detection.11−15 Signal intensity was
recorded using a plate reader. After that, data were graphed in
GraphPad Prism. From the binding curve, we estimated the
binding constants (KD) using the Hill equation, as reported
before.7,8,11,12
2.4. In Vitro Experiments for Blocking ACE2 Binding
with Baculovirus Pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2
Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein Using Fluo-
rescence Imaging. For this experiment, we used human
embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2
(HEK-293T).11−15,26,27 Since delta variant SARS-CoV-2 is a
biosafety-level-3 virus, for our experiment, we used a GFP
(green ﬂuorescent protein)-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped
with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein
(catalog number #C1123G).11−15,26,27 The experimental
details are reported in the Supporting Information.
2.5. Virus Inhibition Experiments for HNP1 and LL-37
Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs. For this
experiment, we used HEK293T cells. Dilutions of test HNP1
and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs were
made in DMEM.13,14,26,27 The GFP-tagged Baculovirus
pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)
spike protein stock was mixed with the HNP1 and LL-37
human host defense peptide-attached GQDs at diﬀerent
concentrations and incubated for 1 h. The experimental details
are reported in the Supporting Information.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Determining the Photoluminescence Quantum
Yield and Lifetime from HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host
Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs. The UV−vis spectra
from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached
GQDs, as reported in Figure S2E, show two peaks. The ﬁrst
absorption peak is observed at ∼270 nm, which can be due to
the π−π* transition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which
can be due to the n−π* transition.18−23 Figure S2F and Figure
2C show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached GQDs
at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at
416 nm can be due to the electron−hole recombination and
quantum size eﬀect.18−23 Figure 2B shows that peptide-
attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue ﬂuorescence under UV
light. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was
determined to be ∼0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The
photoluminescence decay proﬁles for peptide-attached GQDs
are reported in Figure 2D, which ﬁt very well with the triple
exponential function with τ1 = 0.32 ns, τ2 = 2.2 ns, and τ3 = 7.3
ns.
3.2. Determining the Biocompatibility and Cytotox-
icity. To determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of
the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, we used normal
skin HaCaT cells, lung cancer A549 cells, and human
embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of
ACE2 (HEK-293T).11−15,26,27 All cells were treated with 60
μg/mL GQDs + 4 μg/mL LL-37 + 4 μg/mL HNP1 for 48
h.11−15,26,27 As reported in Figures S3A,B in the Supporting
Information, after treatment with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-
attached GQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell
viability was hardly changed for all the cell lines. The reported
experimental data clearly indicate that the LL-37 and HNP1
peptide-attached GQDs do not exhibit any detectable
cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment.

SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD

and HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-
Attached GQDs. Next, we have determined whether the
SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD can
bind with HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-
attached GQDs, which is a very important parameter for the
inhibition of virus infection. The experimental details are
reported in the Supporting Information. The luminescence
signals from GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike
protein were recorded with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a
diode laser.11−15,26,27 The reported photograph in Figure 2B
also shows that the intense ﬂuorescence from peptide-
conjugated GQDs decreases in the presence of the spike
protein.
In the case of peptide-attached GQDs, the graphene
quantum dots can bind with the spike protein via hydrophobic
interaction, hydrogen bonding, and charge transfer inter-
action.18,19 On the other hand, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides can
bind with the spike protein via hydrogen bonding, electrostatic
interaction, and hydrophobic interaction.11,12,15 The observed
huge ﬂuorescence quenching clearly indicates the strong
interaction between peptide-attached GQDs and the spike
protein. The reported ﬂuorescence quenching can be the result
of the static quenching due to the formation of a non-
ﬂuorescent complex in the ground state. On the other hand,
the observed quenching can be due to the dynamic quenching,
which is based on the Förster resonance energy transfer from
the donor peptide-attached GQDs to the acceptor spike
protein. As reported in Figure 2D, the photoluminescence
decay curve remains almost the same in the presence or
absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein, which
indicates that the ﬂuorescence lifetime (τ1 = 0.30 ns, τ2 = 2.2
ns, and τ3 = 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very
similar to the data in the absence of the protein. The
experimental lifetime data clearly indicates that the observed
quenching is a static quenching process.
Similarly, as reported in Figure S1E in the Supporting
Information, the UV−vis absorption maximum from peptide-
attached GQDs is ∼10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength in
the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the
formation of a complex in the ground state between the
peptide-attached GQDs and spike protein. Often, the static
quenching process can be described by the Stern−Volmer
equation20,22,24,25 as described below

where F0 is the ﬂuorescence intensity from the peptide-
conjugated GQDs in the absence of the spike protein, F is the
ﬂuorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and
[spike] is the protein concentration. KSV is the Stern−Volmer
constant, which depends on quencher rate coeﬃcients (Kq)
and the lifetime τ0 of the GQDs’ excited state in the absence of
spike. As shown in Figure 2E, the plot of log[F0/F] versus
log[spike concentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-
conjugated GQDs indicates the nonlinear ﬂuorescence
quenching process, which may be due to the multiple binding
sites.
Since we have observed a nonlinear Stern−Volmer
quenching proﬁle, we have used the modiﬁed Hill equation24,25

where Kb is the dissociation constant, [S]t is the concentration
of the spike protein at any given time, [G]t is the concentration
of peptide-conjugated GQDs at any given time, and n is the
Hill coeﬃcient. We have determined the binding aﬃnity,
which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by ﬁtting the
curve with eq 3, as reported in Figures 2E,G. As shown in
Table 1, we have determined the binding aﬃnity as 8 ± 1 nM
and n = 2.6.
As shown in Figures 2F,G, the luminescence signal from
HNP1 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs decreases
slowly as the concentration of the spike protein increases. By
ﬁtting the curve using eq 3, we have determined the binding
aﬃnity as 120 ± 20 nM in this case, as reported in Table 1.
To verify our data with a well-documented assay, we used
the ELISA-like assay using the His-tag delta variant SARS-
CoV-2 S1 protein.26,27 The experimental details are reported in
the Supporting Information. As reported in Figure 2H, the plot
shows the binding curve between the peptide-conjugated
GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate-based assay. From
the binding curve, we have estimated the binding aﬃnity as 9
± 1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL-37 and HNP1
peptide-conjugated GQDs, which matches very well with the
ﬂuorescence quenching data. Similarly, we have estimated the
binding aﬃnity for the delta variant spike with diﬀerent
peptide-conjugated GQDs, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides and
ACE2, as reported in Table 1.
From the experimental data, we can conclude that the
binding aﬃnities for the delta variant spike with LL-37 peptide-
and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are comparable with that
for ACE2-delta variant spike binding. Also, the binding
aﬃnities for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs are better than only one type of peptide-attached
GQDs. The observed higher binding aﬃnity of GQDs
conjugated with both the peptides (HNP and LL-37) than
GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide can be due to
the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike protein in
the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported
theoretical modeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the
spike-RBD in eight sites (LYS417, GLN493, THR500,
ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502).7,11 On
the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike-RBD in six sites
(LYS417, ALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and
GLN493).7,11 The observed higher binding may be due to
the multiple binding site interaction.

During the past three years of pandemic, several new viral
lineages such as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1),
delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had
risen.1−6 To understand how the binding aﬃnity between
LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1
protein RBD of diﬀerent variants varies, we have determined
the eﬀects of RBD mutations on the binding capability with
peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in Table 2, our
experimental data indicate that the binding aﬃnity for the
delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD is higher than those for the
alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD.
3.4. Demonstrating ACE2−Spike Protein Binding
Blocking Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta
Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus. Next, to ﬁnd out whether LL-37
peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with
delta variant SARS-CoV-2, we have performed an experiment
using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta
variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown in Figure 3A, the
luminescence intensity from peptide-attached GQDs decreases
abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates that LL-
37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with
Baculovirus pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2.
As reported in Figure 3B,C, the TEM images indicate that
peptide-conjugated GQDs are bound on the virus. Since the
binding aﬃnity for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached GQDs, we
observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on
the virus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After
that, to determine whether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-
conjugated GQDs have the capability to prevent the delta
variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking the spike
protein RBD−ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic
kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-
293T). For this experiment, we have used GFP-tagged
Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant
(B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number #C1123G). The
experimental details are reported in the Supporting Informa-
tion.26,27 As shown in Figure 3D, in the absence of peptide-
attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus binds with
ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green ﬂuorescence is
due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus particles
on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2.
Figure 3E shows the bright-ﬁeld image of HEK-293T cells,
which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped virus on the
cell surface. As shown in Figure 3H, in the presence of LL-37
and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta
variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on HEK-293 T cells, and
as a result, we have not observed any green ﬂuorescence.

Since LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have high
binding aﬃnity with the delta variant spike protein, the data
shown above indicates that they can be used to completely
block the binding between ACE2 and the spike protein. Due to
the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have
the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta
variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the
other hand, as reported in Figures 3F,G, LL-37 peptide-
attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot
completely block the virus spike protein−ACE2 binding. As
reported in Figure 4B, the blocking capability decreases from
100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used. Also, the
blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding
aﬃnity, as reported in Table 1.
3.5. Determining the Inhibition Ability for LL-37 and
HNP1 Peptide-Conjugated GQDs Using the B Pseudo-
typed SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Virus. Next,
we have estimated the inhibition ability for delta variant SARS-
CoV-2 pseudovirions using peptide-conjugated GQDs. The
experimental details are reported in the Supporting Informa-
tion.13,14,26,27 Figure 4B shows the % inhibition, which clearly
shows that 100% inhibition was achieved in the case of LL-37
(4 μg/mL) and HNP1 (4 μg/mL)-attached GQDs (30 μg/
mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition was
achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used.
The reported data in Table 3 and Figure 4B also indicate
that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL)
peptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly,
using only the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved
40% inhibition. From the reported inhibition data, we can
conclude that the inhibition eﬃciencies for LL-37 and HNP1-
attached GQDs are much higher than only one type of
peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To
understand better about the above experimental observation,
we have also performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments
after LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are exposed to the
virus for 12 h. The SEM image in Figure 4C and the TEM
image in Figure 4D clearly show that LL-37 and HNP1-
attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane of Baculovirus
pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)
spike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus
collapses and spike proteins that are attached on the lipid
membrane are removed. The above process helps to stop the
spread of the delta variant virus.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and
LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the
delta variant virus entry into the host cells by blocking spike
protein RBD binding with ACE2. We have demonstrated that
peptide-attached GQD-based ﬂuorescence quenching can be
used for determining the binding aﬃnity of the delta variant
(B.1.617.2) spike protein. The reported experimental data
show that the eﬀective binding aﬃnity between the HNP1 and
LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs and delta variant spike
protein is comparable with the ACE2−spike protein binding
aﬃnity. Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD,
we have shown that the binding aﬃnity for the delta B.1.617.2
variant is higher than those for other variants. Our
experimental observation using the HEK293T-human ACE2
cell line demonstrated that LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-
conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting
the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host
cells and the inhibition eﬃciency for two peptide-attached
GQDs is much higher than those for only one type of peptide-
attached GQDs or only peptides or GQDs.
