SUMMARY
While fruit ﬂies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space,
studies examining their immune systems’ interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking.
Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive
and parasitized ground and space ﬂies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing mutant strain
were examined. Inﬂammation-related genes were activated in space in both ﬂy strains. Whereas control
ﬂies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Sur-
prisingly, control ﬂies were more sensitive to spaceﬂight than mutant ﬂies; many of their essential genes
were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than ﬂy hosts, and spaceﬂight did not signiﬁ-
cantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant
wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-ﬂight and will be invaluable for host-para-
site studies on Earth.
INTRODUCTION
As humans become a space-faring species, they must confront the dual and long-term challenges of microgravity and radiation. Robust im-
mune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array
of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many
host species, with a focus on humans,1 the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known. This question is
especially important as immune-compromised humans (and other animal hosts), or those with dysfunctional immunity, venture into space.
Experiments with the Drosophila model organism and studies on astronauts over the last decade have revealed how highly conserved innate
immune functions and mechanisms are altered in space.2,3 These and earlier studies (reviewed by Iyer et al.4) also demonstrated that fruit ﬂies
can successfully develop in space, opening the system to further inquiry. In this study, we examined the effects of spaceﬂight on
D. melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the International Space Station (ISS), aboard
SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission.
Parasitoid wasps represent a large class of obligate parasitic insects, and many are used in the biocontrol of agricultural pests. The term
endoparasitoid refers to the wasp whose preimaginal stages develop within the host larva and pupa. The developing parasitoid (or parasite)
eats the host as both continue to develop; the host builds a puparium that a parasite ultimately occupies and emerges from. Drosophila larvae
and pupae serve as hosts to more than 60 species of such parasitic wasps.5 The female wasp’s sharp ovipositor pierces the ﬁrst line of host
defense—the larval exoskeleton, made of cuticle—to introduce an egg and venom. This step triggers an encapsulation response in which
larval blood cells (hemocytes) of the hosts’ innate immune system (macrophage-like plasmatocytes—called macrophages here—and their
derivatives, lamellocytes) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg.6 This melanotic capsule itself, composed

of dozens of macrophages and lamellocytes, shields the host from the dead parasite as it continues to become an adult ﬂy. Encapsulation, an
innate immune response, is conserved across many multicellular animals.6,7
Encapsulation of the parasite egg by Drosophila larvae is not always fatal to the parasite, as active and passive means to avoid encapsu-
lation have evolved to assure that at least some percentage of parasitic wasp infections are successful. Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) is highly
successful on many Drosophila species and is considered to be a generalist parasite.8 Its venom contains spiked extracellular vesicle (EV)-like
structures with immune-suppressive activities.9,10 Lh EVs are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, and their protein composition is similar to
that of mammalian EVs.11,12 L. boulardi (Lb) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range than Lh.8,13 Lb EVs also bear
spikes, are immune-suppressive, and have a protein proﬁle similar to Lh EVs.13–16 There is no evidence that either Lb or Lh EV-like structures
possess a genome or that they replicate in either the wasp or the host. The protein-coding genes of Lh EVs are present in the wasp genome.12
While the venom EVs from both Lb and Lh are immune suppressive, their effects on hemocytes differ greatly. Lb EVs enter lamellocytes and
alter lamellocyte shape to suppress encapsulation without killing them.17 Lh EVs, on the other hand, lyse lamellocytes within a few hours after
infection.18,19 Lh EVs also kill circulating macrophages as well as hemocyte progenitors housed within a small hematopoietic organ called the
lymph gland.18,20 Thus, despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune-deﬁcient hosts, mak-
ing it conducive for wasp development. In 20–25 days, one adult wasp emerges per ﬂy pupa; male and female wasps mate as free-living adults,
and females then deposit eggs into ﬂy larvae to initiate another generation.8,13,21
In this Fruit Fly Lab-03 (FFL-03) spaceﬂight experiment, we compared the development of two ﬂy strains: one healthy and another suffering
from chronic inﬂammation (CI). The latter strain carries a dominant germline mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) gene to activate the transcrip-
tion factor called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT). The mutation constitutively activates the ﬂy’s innate immune JAK-
STAT and Toll signaling pathways.22–24 Components of both pathways are highly conserved in evolution, including humans. Both immune
pathways also control hematopoietic development. Their genetic activation in the ﬂy leads to the overgrowth of hematopoietic progenitors.
As a result, small granuloma-like tumors form melanized structures that are observed in the larval hemolymph.23–26 In their physical properties,
these small tumors are analogous to the hemocyte capsules formed around wasp eggs and are considered to be autoimmune-like reactions
to self-tissue.27,28 Tumor growth, inﬂammatory gene expression, and metabolic inﬂammation in hopTum-l larvae are sensitive to aspirin admin-
istration.24 Thus, the hopTum-l background is a ‘‘stand-in’’ disease model for animal leukemia and CI.22–24 In humans, aberrant JAK-STAT and
Toll-nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling is linked to malignancies, immune deﬁciency, inﬂammation, autoimmunity, and cancer and is there-
fore the focus of therapeutic measures.29,30
The aims of this study were to (a) compare how conditions in the ISS affect healthy control and CI ﬂy hosts; (b) examine if the development
of endoparasites occurs normally in the ISS; and (c) study if parasite virulence is affected in space. We report that fewer than expected tumor-
free control fruit ﬂy strain returned to Earth, but, unexpectedly, the tumor-bearing CI strain succeeded in space just as well as ground controls.
In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins) that
contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected in space, but genes essential for life were downregulated
only in the control fruit ﬂy strain. Orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. However, inﬂammation-related genes
were activated in both strains, and, while the control ﬂies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased.
The effects of spaceﬂight on parasite emergence were minimal, if any, and changes in the expression of virulence genes were modest, at best.
The venom activity of Lh from space wasps was comparable to that of ground wasps, and their virulence EV particles were normally distributed
within the hosts. Visible mutations affecting wing shape, color, and ovipositor integrity were identiﬁed in the progeny of space L. heterotoma.
Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to astronaut’s health during spaceﬂight. Bacteria reared under microgravity conditions exhibit an
increase in virulence.31,32 Thus, in addition to assessing changes in host immune mechanisms, it is important to evaluate changes in pathogen
or parasite virulence in space in the context of their natural hosts. Our studies show that metazoan parasites can develop normally in space,
retaining their infection strategies. Continued analysis of such systems will be important to help establish multigenerational studies and to
obtain a ﬁne-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.
RESULTS
Spaceﬂight compromises y w but not hopTum-l emergence
Lb and Lh females attack their larval hosts, introducing one or more egg and venom into the host’s body cavity. Depending on the host’s
ability to defend itself and the wasp’s ability to overcome host defenses, one of the two insects emerges alive from the host’s puparium (Fig-
ure 1A). To study the effects of spaceﬂight on this host-parasite scufﬂe, naive hosts or Lb17-/Lh14-infected hosts were held in ventilated ﬂy
boxes (VFBs); these ﬂy boxes were then placed into a cargo transfer bag (CTB) aboard the ISS or at the ground facility tracking ISS conditions
(Figures 1B and 1C). The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two ﬂy-only cultures (ﬂy strains y w and y w, hopTum-l) and four ﬂy/parasite
co-cultures on each host strain (Figure 1D). Survival of animals was scored post-ﬂight (see STAR Methods).
We found that the overall yield of both male and female y w ﬂies in each vial was roughly half of that of the ground-reared ﬂies (Figures 2A–
2C; FFL-03 ground control and space samples retrieved post-ﬂight are referred to as G0 and S0, respectively). The trend was somewhat
different for the hopTum-l animals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceﬂight; while spaceﬂight actually favored male viability
slightly but signiﬁcantly (average 44 versus 57 males/vial), female development remained unaffected (Figures 2A–2C). Thus, under the FFL-03
experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceﬂight, underscoring the complex interplay of
these factors. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the yields of ﬂies and wasps from the ﬂy/wasp co-culture vials (Figures 2D and 2E).

Effects of spaceﬂight on gene expression in adult ﬂies
To understand the molecular basis of the effects of spaceﬂight on ﬂies, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) gene expression results
in naive adult ﬂies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were deﬁned as adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2Fold Change (FC)| > 1. The close clus-
tering of the four replicates and high variation among the four sample types in the principal-component analysis (PCA) show that the exper-
iment was well controlled (Figure S1A). Overall, the y w strain was more sensitive to spaceﬂight than hopTum-l, with 13.22% versus 6.78% DEGs
(spaceﬂight versus ground control samples), respectively (Table S1), a difference that is also reﬂected in the PCA plot (Figure S1A). A separate
RNA-Seq analysis of white-eyed (w1118) ﬂies, also on the SpaceX-14 mission, reported 6.49% and 3.25% DEGs in S0 versus G0 female and male
ﬂy heads, respectively (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p values < 0.05; total number of genes expressed was 13,99133). Although the sam-
ple types in the two studies are different, these results suggest that the y w strain is more sensitive to space conditions than the y w hopTum-l
and the w1118 strains. On Earth, the hopTum-l strain showed 9.69% DEGs relative to y w, with more than two-thirds of DEGs upregulated and the
remaining DEGs downregulated. In space, this differential expression was enhanced (14.03% of genes affected), but the proportion of upre-
gulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal (Table S1).
Volcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity proﬁles in each comparison (Figures S1B–S1E). This distinction be-
tween the strains is also clearly evident from Gene Ontology-based Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis
showing active Toll/Imd (immune deﬁciency) signaling not only in naive G0 hopTum-l compared to y w ﬂies but, surprisingly, also in S0 y w
and hopTum-l ﬂies, relative to their G0 counterparts (Figure S2A). Furthermore, for these same three comparisons, the top 20 signiﬁcantly en-
riched (adjusted p value < 0.05) Gene Ontology terms in Biological Process enrichment analyses included host defense terms such as
response to bacterium, response to other organism, and response to biotic stimulus (Figure S2B). These four comparisons allowed us to
decouple the effects of genetic strain differences in the S0/G0 culture conditions. We next examined changes in expression patterns of
the most signiﬁcantly DEGs (Top DEGs), genes essential to ﬂy viability (Essential DEGs), and immune genes in the JAK/STAT and Toll/Imd
pathways (Pathway DEGs), as summarized in Figure S1F.
Top DEGs in space include members of protease, endopeptidase, and matrisome gene families
We analyzed 172 annotated Top DEGs (see STAR methods for selection of Top DEGs) and identiﬁed six proﬁles described here in two broad
categories (Figures 3A–3F). In the ﬁrst category (Figures 3A and 3B), we consider the Top DEGs showing differential expression in the two ﬂy
strains as follows. (a) Top DEGs upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus
S0 y w) include genes annotated for stress- and immune-related peptides (Tot and Tep family members), proteases, and endopeptidases
(Figure 3A). (b) The Top DEGs downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hopTum-l versus
S0 y w) include members of the lysozyme gene family, histone H4 genes, serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and other enzymes (Figure 3B).
Exceptions to both of these trends were also observed (Figures 3A and 3B). These results deﬁne strong differences in DEG patterns in hopTum-l
and y w ﬂies. They also show that the molecular gene expression differences between two genetic strains, for many but not all genes, are
maintained in spaceﬂight conditions.
In the second broad category, we consider the effects of spaceﬂight on Top DEGs in individual strains as follows (Figures 3C–3F). (a) Top
DEGs upregulated in S0 y w, when compared to the respective ground control group (i.e., G0 y w), encode (i) structural proteins for cuticle
(e.g., chitin-binding domain-containing proteins of the Twdl, CPLCA, and Cpr families) and (ii) proteins with the GYR/YLP domain or immune
response-related proteins (Figure 3C). (b) Top DEGs downregulated in S0 y w ﬂies but not in S0 hopTum-l ﬂies, when compared to respective
ground control groups, include members of the yellow gene family (yellow-g, yellow-g2, yellow-e3), bearded gene family (Brd, Tom, BobA),

Histone H1s, and several genes for chorion constituents and chorion assembly (e.g., Cp7Fb, Cp7Fc, Cp16, Cp19, Cp36, Cp38, Mur11Da; Fig-
ure 3D). These Cp genes are clustered on the X and third chromosomes, and the gene clusters are selectively ampliﬁed in the follicle cells of
the ovary.39 (c) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 hopTum-l, when compared to the respective ground control group (G0 hopTum-l), include Cpr fam-
ily genes, Osiris family genes, tracheal-prostasin (tpr), a protein important for sleep regulation (nemuri, nur), and CG3108 (Figure 3E). (d) Top
downregulated DEGs in S0 versus G0 ﬂies of both genetic backgrounds include several cuticle-related (CPLCA, CPLCP) families and ﬂight-
related genes (e.g., ﬂightin [ﬂn] and Troponin C isoform 4 [TpnC4]; Figure 3F). Chitin supports the epidermal and tracheal cuticles and the
peritrophic matrices that line the gut while the chorion makes up the egg shell. These comparative RNA-Seq results suggest that matrisome
genes of many multigene families that encode proteins of the Drosophila cuticle40 are sensitive to spaceﬂight.
Essential genes are downregulated in y w ﬂies exposed to spaceﬂight
To further understand the differential effects of spaceﬂight on ﬂy survival, we examined the expression of 1,024 essential genes that have
been identiﬁed in genetic experiments as indispensable for life (see STAR methods). Across the four comparisons, we found 137 essential
genes to be differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1). Strikingly, the space environment had a profound effect on the
differential expression of these genes between the two genetic backgrounds. For example, in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w samples, only 15
differentially expressed essential genes were either upregulated (11 genes) or downregulated (4 genes), whereas spaceﬂight conditions
affected the transcription of 95 genes in the S0 hopTum-l versus S0 y w comparison (81 genes upregulated, 14 genes downregulated,
Figure 4A).

The most striking effects of spaceﬂight were seen in y w ﬂies: 96 genes were either upregulated (24 genes) or downregulated (72 genes) in y
w space-ﬂown samples compared to the respective ground control samples. The most strongly upregulated DEGs of these 96 DEGs, with
log2-(FC) > 2, include Cpr65Ec (cuticular protein), CG15784, and CG30457 (both latter genes lack annotation). The most highly downregu-
lated genes are S1A serine protease Notopleural and histone H1 His1:CG31617, with log2-(FC) < 1.9. Remarkably, gene expression changes
were milder in space-ﬂown hopTum-l samples, with the expression of only 10 genes signiﬁcantly affected; either 2 genes were upregulated or 8
genes were downregulated, compared to respective ground control samples (Figure 4A). These results likely explain why y w ﬂies were more
sensitive to spaceﬂight than hopTum-l ﬂies.
Differentially expressed essential genes reveal association with human disease conditions
To assess why S0 y w ﬂies were sensitive to spaceﬂight and if they have relevance to human conditions, we ﬁltered the 137 essential DEGs
for a DIOPT (Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) score of at least 12 and identiﬁed 34 high-scoring
DEGs that we grouped into broad categories. Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were signiﬁcantly downregulated in S0 y w versus G0 y
w ﬂies. Oseg5 and Biotinidase expression was downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w ﬂies; for both genes, this downregulation was
maintained in space. Only two genes, veil and melt, showed signiﬁcant upregulation (Figure 4B). This analysis revealed that human ortho-
logs of these 34 ﬂy genes affect many aspects of human physiology (see Figure 4B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low
DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most signiﬁcantly upregulated genes in
hopTum-l versus y w ﬂies were l(2)03659 (enables organic anion transporter activity) and Ir40a (involved in response to humidity changes),42
both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0 y w ﬂies and S0 hopTum-l ﬂies, were either upregulated
or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls (Figure 4C).
Spaceﬂight activates the expression of immune genes in S0 adults and increases inﬂammatory tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l
A comparison of the Gene Ontology-based pathway and Biological Process enrichment terms associated with the y w versus hopTum-l tran-
scriptional proﬁles provided a ‘‘big picture’’ view of the differential effects of space on the two strains. Both plots show that, while most GO
terms and almost all biological processes are affected in y w ﬂies, only a few parameters change in both strains. Most notable of these are the
Toll/Imd pathway and lysosomal pathway terms that are signiﬁcantly enriched in the space samples for both genotypes, suggesting the acti-
vation of inﬂammation-related genes in space (Figures S2A and S2B).
Since the hopTum-l mutant ﬂy strain carries a constitutively active JAK enzyme,43 the transcriptional activation of known JAK-STAT target
genes is expected in hopTum-l ﬂies relative to y w ﬂies without this mutation. Consistent with this expectation we found many target genes
(Idgf1, SOCS36E, TotA, CG3829, CG4793, CG13559, and CG10764) to be differentially upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w ﬂies.
High levels of JAK-STAT pathway genes TotA, diedel, et, and CG4793 in hopTum-l versus y w were maintained in space (Figure 5A). Similarly,
several Toll pathway components (PGRPs SA, SB1, and SD, grass, SPE) and target genes were signiﬁcantly upregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus
G0 y w ﬂies (Figures 5B–5E).
Whereas many immune genes are constitutively active in hopTum-l ﬂies, remarkably, spaceﬂight activated the expression of a majority of
these immune genes in y w ﬂies (Figures 5B–5E). The JAK-STAT pathway ligands (upd2 and upd3), several core components (SOCS36E), and
target genes (TotA, Gf, mfas, and CG15211) were activated in S0 y w versus G0 y w ﬂies (Figure 5A). A clear signature for Toll/Imd pathway
activation was also observed in S0 y w adults. Elevated expression of pathway components (CG8046, Toll-9, Figure 5B), pathogen recognition
receptors (PRRs, PGRPs SA, SB1, SD, Figure 5C), several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (Figure 5D), and other Toll/Imd pathway target
genes (Figure 5E) was observed in S0 y w versus G0 y w ﬂies. Notably, some Toll/Imd pathway target genes (e.g., Drsl2, 3, 5) were also activated
in S0 hopTum-l versus G0 hopTum-l ﬂies (Figure 5D).
To examine if the immune gene expression changes identiﬁed in space animals might have inﬂuenced tumor development in S0 hopTum-l
adults (Figure 6A), we scored tumor number and size (small, medium, large tumors, T score; see STAR methods and Figures 6B and 6C). In
25–30 adults from three independent G0 and S0 cultures, the average weighted T score was 1.07 G 0.22 in G0 adults and 2.94 G 0.40 in S0 ﬂies
(Figure 6D), although this difference is lost in the adult G1 and S1 progeny of these G0/S0 animals (Figure 6E). Tumors were not detected in S0
y w animals, even though they showed evidence of high immune signaling.

High immune gene expression persists in naive S1 larvae
As in the mutant hopTum-l adults, high gene expression levels of the JAK-STAT and Toll/Imd pathway genes encoding ligands, cytoplasmic
mediators, and targets were recorded in naive G1 and S1 hopTum-l larvae when compared to G1 y w and S1 y w larvae, respectively
(Figures S3A–S3E). Thus, in hopTum-l larvae, the immune effects of spaceﬂight are evaluated in the background of constitutive immune
signaling.
We assessed if naive S1 y w or hopTum-l larvae showed any lingering effects of space observed in their S0 parents. Spaceﬂight-responsive
differentially expressed immune genes in naive S1 y w larvae included CG10764, LUBEL, PGRP-SB1, -SC1a, -SC1b, and AMP genes, CecB,
AttC, Drs, and Drsl5 (Figures S3A–S3D). Similarly, naive S1 hopTum-l larvae showed elevated expression of immune targets DptA, DptB,
CecA2, Drsl3, Drsl5, and CecA1 relative to their G1 counterparts (Figure S3D). Thus, in both genetic backgrounds, immune signaling was
elevated in S1 larvae, even though the affected target genes were different. Naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae maintained the difference
in inﬂammatory tumor burden observed in their parents (0.08 G 0.03 and 0.21 G 0.06, respectively, p = 0.010; Figures 7A and 7B), although
the mitotic index in the underlying hematopoietic tissue was not signiﬁcantly different (2.74 G 0.93% of G1 and 1.95 G 0.66% of S1 macro-
phages were phospho-histone H3 positive; p = 0.53).
Tumor-encapsulation scores are higher in S1 than in G1 hopTum-l hosts
Previous studies with hopTum-l larvae have shown that Lb17 attack provokes stronger cellular immune reactions than Lh14 does. While Lb17
attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes (not recruited into the melanized tumors),
Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae instead develop small melanized specks8 (see Figure S4 for examples of immune reactions). To assess if naive
S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larval hosts differ in their ability to mount an encapsulation response, we exposed them to G0/S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps
and computed a composite tumor-encapsulation (T + E) score for these animals, which measures their self- and wasp egg-induced encap-
sulation response. The experimental design consisted of scoring T + E scores from all G/S and host/parasite combinations. The following
ﬁndings emerged from our comparisons of naive versus Lb17- or Lh14-infected hopTum-l hosts.
First, naive versus G0 or S0 Lb-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts showed a 17- to 52-fold increase in T + E scores, and scores from three of
the four combinations differed signiﬁcantly (Figures 7A and 7B). The T + E score in naive versus G0/S0 Lh-infected G1 or S1 hopTum-l hosts in all
four combinations similarly increased from 1.4- to 14-fold, and the increases were signiﬁcantly different across all four comparisons (Figures 7A
and 7B). It is noteworthy that the canonical Toll pathway target Drs is strongly upregulated in S1 hopTum-l hosts after Lb17 infection, but its
expression remains unchanged after Lh14 infection (Drs, Figures S3F and S3G). This trend is characteristic of these wasps’ effects on wild-type
hosts8 and suggests that the overall differences in wasp virulence were maintained in spaceﬂight.
Second, S1 compared to G1 hosts, infected by S0 (but not G0) wasps of both species (S0 Lb/Lh_S1 hosts versus S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts), were
more competent at mounting an immune response (3.64 G 0.46 versus 2.11 G 0.72 [p = 0.0199] for Lb17 and 0.76 G 0.03 versus 0.11 G 0.04
[p = 5.55 e10] for Lh14; Figures 7A and 7B). Thus, not only is the tumor score higher in naive S1 compared to G1 hopTum-l larvae but S1 hosts
are also more immune reactive than G1 hosts.
Third, on ground hosts, space wasps of both species differed from ground wasps in their ability to elicit encapsulation. T + E scores in G1
hopTum-l hosts subjected to S0 or G0 parasites of the same species (S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts versus G0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts) showed that, for both par-
asites, the T + E values for S0 wasp infections were signiﬁcantly lower than the corresponding values for G0 parasites (2.11 G 0.72 versus
4.10 G 0.65 for Lb17 [p = 0.0199] and 0.11 G 0.04 versus 1.13 G 0.33 [p = 0.000915] for Lh14). The difference was not signiﬁcant in space hosts
(Figures 7A and 7B). These results suggest that, while S1 larval progeny may be adapting to normal gravity and other terrestrial conditions,
they retain altered immune physiology of their space parents, albeit transiently. S0 wasps largely maintain their inherent virulent strategies,
although we could detect subtle differences in their abilities to affect host immunity relative to G0 wasps.
Lymph gland morphologies of naive and infected G0 and S0 hosts
Upon Lb17 attack, hemocytes in wild-type lymph gland lobes divide and differentiate into lamellocytes and disperse into the hemocoel to
surround the wasp egg.44–46 Hemocytes in the hopTum-l lymph gland actively divide and differentiate in the absence of infection.43 Because
of the high inﬂammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third-instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal
lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating
heart, which directs the ﬂow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity (Figures S5A–S5D). The anterior-most lobes are
the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than
the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naive y w ground and space hosts were continuous with none-to-little dispersal. Like lobes

from G0 naive y w animals, lobes from S0 naive y w animals did not exhibit any hemocyte loss or any other obvious morphological change
(Figures S5A–S5H).
In contrast to naive y w animals, all anterior lobes of naive G0 and S0 hopTum-l larvae were dispersed due to the effect of the mutation
(Figures S5I–S5P). The mutation also results in some lobes detaching from the dorsal vessel, and many GFP-positive lamellocytes were present
in G0 and S0 hopTum-l samples. Some tumors were observed as small aggregates or as free-ﬂoating structures in the hemolymph made of mac-
rophages and lamellocytes (Figures S5J and S5N). No clear difference in the posterior lobes was detected due to spaceﬂight in either ﬂy strain.
G1 and S1 y w host lymph glands were unresponsive after Lb parasitization (Figures S6A–S6F). In naive G1 hopTum-l lymph glands, GFP-
expressing cells were absent (Figures S6G and S6H), whereas in S1 hosts lamellocytes were clearly observed regardless of infection status
(Figures S6I–S6P). In some samples, lamellocyte-rich tumors were associated with the anterior and posterior lobes (e.g., S1 sample,
Figures S6K and S5L). In only one S1 host, the anterior lobes exhibited a strong anti-wasp response (Figure S6O). Thus, even though the
T + E scores rise in response to Lb infection, this difference was not reﬂected in the lymph gland morphologies of the animals we examined.

Lh14 infection results in the gradual loss of hemocytes in all lobes. This effect is attributed to the presence of EVs in the entire lymph
gland.20 EVs were present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and dorsal vessels of G0 and S0 Lh-infected G1 and S1 y w hosts, and this asso-
ciation was accompanied by the loss of hematopoietic progenitors (Figures S7A–S7F). Similarly, in G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts, the progenitor
population was reduced, and EVs were present in the lymph glands of hosts after S0 Lh infection. (G0 Lh wasps were not available for this
experiment.) Lymph glands from uninfected G1 or S1 hosts do not possess EVs (Figures S7G–S7N). Thus, spaceﬂight does not affect the entry
or distribution of Lh EVs in the hemolymphatic system.

Perturbation of Lb and Lh EV gene expression
The venom ﬂuid containing the EVs is injected into the host during oviposition. Due to their close association with and direct effects on target
hemocytes,17,20 our deﬁnition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the EVs. Since standard annotations of wasp
transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes
(Figure S8A). Overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceﬂight were detected (Figures S8B and S8C), although they were
modest, and less than 1.5% of all transcripts identiﬁed showed signiﬁcant change when compared to respective ground controls (293 and
310 transcripts, for Lb17 and Lh14, respectively). A majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps (Figures 8A–8C;
Tables S2 and S3). Furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. Of the downregulated DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05),
more than 80% showed log (2)-FC between 1.00 and 2.00 (228/280 in Lb17 and 250/261 in Lh14). The remaining downregulated DEGs
showed log (2)-FC between 2.00 and 9.18. Only 6 of all DEGs showed a log (2)-FC > 2 for Lb17; this number was 16 for Lh14. These
DEGs do not appear to belong to a speciﬁc functional class, and many lack clear annotations.
The identities of the proteins constituting L. boulardi EVs were recently published.14 Our comparative analysis indicated that Lb EV pro-
teins show an overall proﬁle similar to the Lh EV proﬁle; both are enriched in mammalian EV proteins.15 A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts
were identiﬁed in our RNA-Seq analysis (312/316 for Lb17 and 398/406 for Lh14). In Lb17, 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were signiﬁcantly differ-
entially expressed (Figure 8D). Of these, 28 were downregulated (Table 1). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode
RhoGAP superfamily proteins (GAJA01018902.1, log (2)-FC = 1.27, and GAJA01006288.1, log (2)-FC = 1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily pro-
tein called LbGAP in Lb EVs is implicated in wasp virulence.48,49 Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one
(GAJA01018902.1) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e-55). For Lh14, only 5/398
(1.61%) transcripts were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed. Of these, only one gene, lacking annotation, was about 5-fold upregulated
(Table 2). Of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations, and one is predicted to encode a protein with a chitin-binding domain.
Spaceﬂight does not signiﬁcantly affect wasp emergence
Spaceﬂight did not signiﬁcantly affect the overall development of wasps. The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were com-
parable to those of ground control samples (Figure 2E). The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that each
Leptopilina species successfully disarmed both y w and hopTum-l hosts in space and also on Earth (Figures 2D and 2E). However, while no
hopTum-l hosts escaped parasitization by Lb or Lh in either ground or space cultures, some y w ﬂies emerged in the co-culture vials (Figure 2D),
likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored rela-
tive to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial; Figure S9A), we found no signiﬁcant difference in space- versus ground-reared wasp sam-
ples. Both wasp species raised on either ﬂy host showed equal success in ﬂight and ground conditions (Figure S9B), reinforcing this
conclusion.
EV morphology and Lh14 virulence
We next investigated whether the morphology of EV particles produced by both wasp species is affected by spaceﬂight. In the scanning elec-
tron micrographs of gold-coated samples of G0 and S0 Lb17 wasp venom, we observed no gross morphological difference (Figures S10A–
S10G). The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously9,16 were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped,
spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike-like processes. We observed small

membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0 Lh14 EV mor-
phologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures9), in scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated sam-
ples (Figures S10H–S10S). Overall, the Lh14 particle morphologies were uniform, and the particles were spiked, with variable spike length.
An ex vivo assay was used to detect changes in G0 versus S0 L. heterotoma virulence. Lamellocytes from laboratory-reared hopTum-l larvae
were exposed to venom ﬂuid from G0 or S0 wasps. Venom from both wasp types promoted changes in lamellocyte shape compared to the
buffer control (6.50% G 0.76% G0; 6.12% G 0.71% S0; 2.99% G 0.06% buffer control), but there was no signiﬁcant difference in the S0 versus
G0 Lh14 venom activity (Figures S11A–S11C). These results are consistent with the unremarkable difference in the overall L. heterotoma suc-
cess (emergence) of S0 versus G0 Lh14 wasps.
Mutant Lh14 strains
Space-radiation-induced mutations in D. melanogaster have previously been reported.51,52 We hypothesized that parasitoid wasps are simi-
larly sensitive to high levels of radiation in the ISS. We therefore examined the grandsons of space-returned males (Figure 9A). While no her-
itable defects were observed for any Lb17 or ground-raised Lh14, we obtained two recessive mutations in Lh14 (Figures 9B–9G). In the aurum1
mutant, melanization of the wings is affected, making the normal wings appear golden (horizontal arrows; Figures 9B, 9C, 9E, and 9F; side-by-
side view in panel G). This mutant is homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock could be established (see STAR methods). A second
phenotypic alteration was identiﬁed in this pure-breeding aurum1 stock, where the posterior wing margin in affected individuals is angular
as opposed to the wild-type round shape (vertical arrows; Figures 9D–9F). In rare cases, this kona1 mutation was incompletely penetrant,
where only one wing was affected (Figure 9F). To our knowledge, these are the only live mutant animals in this class of wasps.
To assess if aurum and kona genes are unlinked, we scored over 1,000 sons of unmated double mutant heterozygous females. Roughly
equal numbers of parental and recombinant classes were observed (chi-squared test, p = 0.63; Figure 9H). Even though the kona1 strain
was homozygous viable, we were unable to make a pure-breeding stock. Moreover, we did not ﬁnd wasp eggs in dissected hosts, regardless

of whether the infecting kona1/kona1 females were unmated or mated. This result suggested that homozygous kona1 females were unable to
oviposit while their heterozygous counterparts were successful (Figure 9I). The ovipositors of kona1 homozygotes showed structural defects,
including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle-like ends of the wild-type Lh ovipositor (Figure 9J). Abdominal dissection of kona1/
kona1 females revealed ovaries and eggs that are morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous females (Figure S12).
Thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected in kona1 mutants, and they are sterile due to their inability to oviposit.
DISCUSSION
American scientists ﬁrst launched fruit ﬂies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceﬂight experiments with fruit ﬂies have been
conducted.4 Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carried Habrobracon juglandis into space.53 H. juglandis is a small
ectoparasite that attacks moths. The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceﬂight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction
with spaceﬂight, on D. melanogaster and H. juglandis.53,54 D. melanogaster, however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel
studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost-effective model systems, its high fecun-
dity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual ﬂies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols.
These previous ‘‘fruit ﬂies in space’’ studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural

functions, that have implications for astronaut health.4,55 Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deﬁcits,33,56 Drosophila born in
space can largely survive the dual challenges of short-term exposure to microgravity and radiation.
Strain-speciﬁc effects on survival and transcriptional readouts in Drosophila are induced by spaceﬂight stressors
Spaceﬂight conditions exerted unexpected and differential effects on our experimental Drosophila strains. While the hopTum-l ﬂies with CI
survived just as well in space as on the ground, the y w strain, free of tumors and CI, was surprisingly more vulnerable to the spaceﬂight
stressors, and fewer y w ﬂies emerged from the ﬂight compared to ground cultures. Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between
genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following. First, speciﬁc expression pro-
ﬁles of Top DEGs attributed to genetic differences were maintained in space, suggesting that the gene regulatory circuits underlying these
differences may be sufﬁciently robust and may therefore remain refractory to spaceﬂight.
Second, the Top DEGs include genes encoding structural proteins for the cuticle and the chorion, an observation that was also reported in
a previous multigenerational study on wild-type ﬂies.55 Some of the cuticle-related DEGs were upregulated in one of the two S0 genetic
strains, but not in the other S0 strain, while other DEGs were downregulated in S0 ﬂies of both genetic backgrounds. This result suggests
that transcriptional co-regulation of promoters among Top DEG family members may be adaptive to either or both genetic and environ-
mental variables. Chitin and its associated proteins are part of the ﬂy’s exoskeletal matrisome, and together they support the cells they sur-
round structurally and functionally.57,58 A highly coordinated chitin synthesis and degradation program underlies insect growth. It would be
interesting to assess if the cuticle or the chorion of S0 ﬂies differs from that of G0 ﬂies.
Third, numerous essential genes were downregulated in space in y w, but not in hopTum-l animals, suggesting that the cumulative effect of
their reduced transcription may have led to their reduced viability. Thus, while increased tumor burden and alterations in gene expression in
S0 hopTum-l adults did not compromise their overall survival, y w ﬂies exhibited increased immune gene expression, remained tumor-free in
space, and exhibited reduced survival. Future experiments will help clarify the differential effects of space on the expression of essential genes
in these genetic strains. Many of these essential ﬂy genes are conserved, and their human orthologs are linked to disease conditions. These
results not only deﬁed our expectation that animals with chronic disease would be more vulnerable to spaceﬂight but also suggested that, if
extrapolated to other animals, spaceﬂight’s effects on individuals of distinct genetic backgrounds may not necessarily be straightforward to
predict.
Elevated immune signaling in space hosts
Our previous molecular-genetic analysis of hopTum-l larvae showed that hyperactive Toll signaling in larval lamellocytes contributes to CI
phenotypes.24 A plethora of target genes of both the JAK-STAT and Toll pathways is constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants.
Strikingly, many of the same pathway components and target genes that are constitutively active in hopTum-l mutants are also upregulated
in S0 y w ﬂies, even though the S0 y w ﬂies remained tumor free. A few AMP genes (e.g., Drs, Drsl, CecA, etc.) are further upregulated in S0
hopTum-l ﬂies, suggesting that the increased tumor burden in S0 hopTum-l adults is fueled by ectopic JAK-STAT and Toll signaling induced
in space.
Unlike their parents, however, naive S1 y w larvae did not exhibit a clear and strong inﬂammatory gene expression readout (see S0/G0 y w
column in Figure 5D and S1/G1 y w column in Figure S3D, where constitutive immune signaling does not mask the effects of space). In
contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active in hopTum-l larvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices
of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae, a signiﬁcantly enhanced T
score was observed in naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae. This increased immune reactivity was also reﬂected in the enhanced T + E scores
in infected S1 hopTum-l larvae, relative to their G1 counterparts. The increased tumor burden detected in naive S1 hopTum-l larvae did not
persist in S1 hopTum-l adults. Collectively, these observations suggest that, with re-adaptation to normal gravity, the inﬂammatory effects
of spaceﬂight are transient and reversible. The highly inﬂamed state of hopTum-l animals provided physiological insights into the modest
changes in wasp virulence due to spaceﬂight.

Wasp success, wasp virulence, and gene expression changes
We hypothesized that stress from spaceﬂight could compromise the development of either of the two partners: the ﬂy or the parasite.
Because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development. In an alter-
native scenario, if the effects of spaceﬂight on ﬂy hosts are modest, then endoparasite development should not be affected. Wasps of both
species developed successfully in the ISS environment; the more virulent Lh14 species was equally successful in both conditions, while Lb17
survival was marginally compromised in space. This difference in Lb17 versus Lh14 success may have to do with their dissimilar virulence stra-
tegies, with Lb17 being less successful on D. melanogaster than Lh14.8 Global gene expression changes in space-raised parasites were
remarkably mild, and less than 1.5% of the adult parasite transcripts were affected. Consistent with parasite emergence results, the transcrip-
tion of many more genes was affected in S0 Lb17 than in S0 Lh14. Thus, even though radiation in space led to germline mutations in one of the
two parasites, the overall detrimental effects of microgravity were not sufﬁciently strong to block parasite development. We speculate that the
notable overall success of both parasites in space may be due to their endoparasitoid life histories: developing internally, the preimaginal
stages remain protected from the environmental challenges in space. Parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in
the context of host physiology. With increased travel to space, it is inevitable that parasites will unintentionally hitch a ride with their hosts.
With plans for the colonization of other planets, multigenerational experiments on ‘‘short life cycle’’ organisms such as D. melanogaster and
their associated ﬂora and fauna will become important. Innovative and sophisticated hardware designed for multigenerational studies will be
helpful in this regard.

(A) Steps employed for the isolation of mutant wasps.
(B–F) Phenotypes of mutant wasps (C–F), identiﬁed from space samples compared to wild-type (B) Lh wasps. Males of wild type, aurum1 (pigmentation of the wing
blade and of wing veins affected), and kona1 (wing shape affected) wasps are shown. Horizontal arrows point to differences in melanization in wild-type versus
aurum1 mutants. The color difference is subtle but consistent. Vertical arrows point to the angular wing shape of the kona1 mutant as compared to the rounded
wild-type wing blade. Double mutants in panels (E) and (F) possess both mutant traits. The shape of the left wing in panel (F) is wild-type in appearance, while the
right one (arrow) is angular. Samples in panels B–F were photographed at the same time.
(G) A side-by-side comparison of wild type (left) and aurum1 (right) wings shows a clear difference in the melanization of wing veins.
(H) The aurum and kona loci appear to be unlinked, as F2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions.
(I) Homozygous kona1 females are unable to oviposit based on observations of more than 30 hosts dissected. (The number of hosts scored is indicated in
parentheses).

The virulence properties of both parasites also appeared to be largely maintained in space. This conclusion is based on (a) comparable
yields of parasites in space versus ground cultures, (b) relatively stronger effects of Lb17 on the T + E score compared to Lh14, and (c) stronger
transcriptional activation of Drosomycin (Drs) in S1 hosts after Lb17 infection but not after Lh14 infection (Figures S3F and S3G). It is intriguing
that S0 wasps of both species were less effective at increasing the T + E score in both G1 and S1 hopTum-l hosts. This result suggests that the
space environment did affect wasp physiology or virulence; the latter interpretation being consistent with reported increases in microbial viru-
lence in space.31,32
A clear molecular explanation for differences in S0 versus G0 wasps was not apparent from the molecular analysis of wasp EV gene tran-
scription. Transcript levels of only 29/312 Lb17 EV genes were signiﬁcantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. Only one of
the two predicted RhoGAP superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known LbGAP virulence protein,49 and even its expression
was weakly downregulated in space. The transcription of only 5/398 Lh14 EV transcripts was differentially affected, with only one gene (lacking
annotation) showing  5-fold upregulation. None of these genes is currently implicated in Lh14 virulence. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay,
Lh14 venom from S0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes than Lh14 venom from G0 wasps. The abundance and distri-
bution of G0 and S0 Lh14 EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0 Lh14 EV is
comparable to that of controls. It is possible that the cumulative effects of differential gene expression changes contributed to differences
between S0 and G0 wasps. Alternatively, S0 wasps may differ in their oviposition behavior, affecting the quantity of venom introduced
into the host.
Mutant wasps
Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera makes it convenient to conduct mutational studies in space, as haploid sons (developing from unfertilized
eggs of mutated females) would exhibit dominant or recessive mutant phenotypes. In our study, male wasps were used to evaluate the effects
of radiation on their germline, while female wasps were used in virulence assays. Screening grandsons of S0 Lh14 males developed in space
resulted in the isolation of two visible mutants, one of which is homozygous viable, while the other is homozygous female-sterile. Dosimetry
measurements on SpaceX-14 recorded an average absorbed dose rate of 0.3 mGy/day, or 9.6 mGy for the 32-day duration in the ISS. Being in
low Earth orbit, the ISS is protected by the Earth’s magnetosphere.59 Yet, chronic exposure to these radiation levels likely resulted in DNA
damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Despite efforts to shield the space station from the damaging consequences of ra-
diation,60 our results support previous studies showing that animals in the ISS are at risk for DNA damage and physiological dysfunction.1
Given the success of this mission, systematic studies designed to compare the effects of radiation on Drosophila and Leptopilina may be
particularly insightful, as both species yield high numbers of progeny and mutant phenotypes can be scored in the F1 generation. The risks
of radiation increase considerably with the planned manned lunar missions and other deep space missions for long-term colonization.1,61
Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert
these risks with innovative shielding designs. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics,
and host-parasite biology. The space environment is likely to have as-yet unknown impacts on animal immune function; reﬁning our under-
standing of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space. Studies of
other animal and plant hosts and their natural parasites in modeled microgravity and/or radiation will provide insights into their effects on
host defense and parasite virulence.
Limitations of the study
Spaceﬂight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of
the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34-day
mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufﬁcient
to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [Figure S5].) It
is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T + E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we
observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh ﬂy media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult ﬂies, born in space or on ground, would have
ensured sufﬁcient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS
Experimental design and sample preparation
D. melanogaster strains y1 w1 and y w hopTum-l msn-GAL4; UAS-mCD8-GFP (hopTum-l msn > GFP),24 and wasp species L. boulardi strain 17
(Lb17) and L. heterotoma strain 14 (Lh14),8 were included in the ground control and ﬂight experiments. The hopTum-l strain carries a dominant
point mutation in the human Janus kinase (JAK) homolog, hopscotch.22 This mutation confers constitutive JAK-STAT signaling, which drives
hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation in larval stages; small, melanized tumors form that can be scored in adult ﬂies. In this strain, the
misshapen (msn) promoter directs Gal4 expression to lamellocytes.62 Expression of the UAS-mCD8-GFP transgene helps visualize lamello-
cytes, which make up the bulk of the tumors.

Extensive pre-ﬂight testing was done to estimate the diet volume and insect numbers for optimal growth during the 34-day ﬂight period.
Six conditions (two ﬂy-only cultures, four ﬂy/wasp co-cultures) were distributed among six VFBs (Figure 1). The ﬂy-only cultures were reared in
polystyrene vials containing 12 mL G 1 mL ﬂy food, while the co-culture vials contained 10 mL G 1 mL ﬂy food. The difference in ﬂy food
volume accommodated the respective life histories of the two insect species; unlike ﬂies that depend on ﬂy food medium, wasps consume
the growing ﬂy larvae and pupae. This volume of ﬂy food supported insect growth for 34 days while keeping carbon dioxide production to a
minimum.
Prior to launch, y w ﬂy-only cultures were initiated with 8 female and 5 male ﬂies. The hopTum-l cultures were similarly initiated with 20 female
and 10 male ﬂies. Fly-wasp co-cultures were set up simultaneously by ﬁrst adding the ﬂies to vials for three days, whereupon the ﬂies were
removed and adult wasps introduced. For the y w co-cultures, 30 adult females and 15 adult males were added to each polystyrene vial
for egg-laying. For hopTum-l egg-lays, 35 females and ﬁfteen males were used. Fifteen egg-lays were made for each genotype, and 15 female
and 15 male wasps were added to each egg-lay a day prior to launch.
Mission and hardware details
Six VFBs, each with 15 vials, were placed inside a CTB before the launch of the SpaceX-14 mission to the ISS (Figure 1). The mission was
launched at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Wasp infection modiﬁes ﬂy development; it takes 20–25 days for
wasps to develop into adults, while naive ﬂies complete their development in 10–15 days. Weather-related issues delayed the original mission
time from 31 days to 34 days. The ISS crew installed the samples into the Columbus Module endcone with the CTB lid open to promote air
exchange between the VFBs and cabin air, where they remained until approximately two days prior to their return to Earth. Samples remained
at ambient temperature (22C). Temperature and humidity data in each VFB were collected throughout the ﬂight mission. The radiation
dosimeter on the ISS was the COL1A2 Radiation Assessment Detector, ISS-RAD, that detects charged particles.63 Insects remained in the
VFBs throughout the mission until their return on the Dragon capsule.
A full-scale, near-synchronous ground control was conducted that was staggered 48 h from launch, using the environmental data streamed
to a Space Station Processing Facility Environmental Simulator at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ground control samples were manu-
ally set to recapitulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the space samples. While the temperatures between space and ground
samples were similar for the duration of the experiment, the relative humidity of space samples was higher by 20–25% than that of ground
samples. This was attributed to reduced convection in the microgravity environment, making it more difﬁcult for moisture to evaporate
quickly. The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Paciﬁc Ocean occurred on the same
day at 20:00, off the coast of Long Beach, CA, from where samples were ﬂown to New York. Ground control samples were similarly collected
from KSC and ﬂown to New York.
Condition of insect cultures
Visual inspection of the cultures indicated that most of the ﬂy food in all vials was consumed, and there was no apparent evidence of mold or
other microbial infection in any culture vial. G0 and S0 ﬂy-only vials of both genetic backgrounds did not contain sufﬁcient early instar larvae to
set up wasp infections. (G1/S1 larval hosts were used instead for infection experiments.) Almost all adult wasps retrieved from G0/S0 cultures
developed under corresponding conditions, while adult ﬂy samples contained individuals of mixed age and from 2 to 3 generations. For all
studies, appropriate numbers of animals were randomly selected from different vials.
METHOD DETAILS
Survival studies
Animals in each vial were sorted and scored under a dissecting microscope immediately upon arrival. For ﬂy-only cultures, statistical analysis
was performed on counts after excluding counts from vials where sample counts were incomplete. For co-cultures, statistical analysis was
performed on the number of ﬂies and wasps after excluding vials where either no insects developed or where sample counts were incomplete.
The percentage of female wasps was obtained by dividing the number of female wasps by the total number of wasps in each vial.
Dissections, staining, and imaging
Depending on sample availability, 5–15 animals were dissected to examine lymph glands. Methods for larval lymph gland dissections, stain-
ing, and imaging were previously published.64–67 Lymph glands were counter-stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technol-
ogies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen). For Lh-infected G1 or S1 larvae, primary mouse anti-p40 antibody9,20 (1:1000) was used.
Fixed and stained samples were imaged on the Laser Scanning Zeiss 710 or 800 confocal microscopes controlled with Zeiss Zen imaging soft-
ware in the CCNY core facilities. Whole insects were imaged with a Leica MZFLIII attached to an Optronics camera. Images were collected
using the Magnaﬁre-SP software.
Mitotic index
Three-day egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l adult ﬂies (described above) were set up at 25C. Three to ﬁve wandering third-instar larvae were used
per hemocyte smear for each replicate; three biological replicates were performed. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-his-
tone H3 antibody (1:200, Millipore Sigma), which was visualized with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (1:5000,

Thermo Scientiﬁc). Antibody binding was visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining (125 mg/mL BCIP and 250 mg/mL NBT, from Promega).
The percentage of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages was calculated by dividing the number of phospho-histone H3-positive mac-
rophages by the total number of macrophages over six visual ﬁelds. Cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope.
Adult tumorigenesis
Tumors in randomly chosen G0 and S0 hopTum-l adults (20 males and 5–10 females, 22C) were scored 6.5 days (25C) after their return. The
G1 and S1 progeny of these G0 and S0 hopTum-l ﬂies was reared at 27C, and their abdominal tumors were similarly scored 18.5 days post egg-
lay.24 Using a dissecting microscope, abdominal tumors were categorized as follows: small (< 0.5 body segment), medium (0.5–1 body
segment), and large (> 1 body segment). Small-, medium-, and large-sized tumors were arbitrarily weighed as 1, 2, and 3, respectively,
and all tumors in each animal were recorded. The average number of tumor structures per animal was determined by dividing the sum of
all tumors in each replicate by the total number of animals scored. Three biological replicates were performed for both S0/G0 and S1/G1
comparisons. A Student’s t test was used to determine if the averages of two datasets differed signiﬁcantly from each other.
Infection and larval host immunity assay
Egg-lays of G0/S0 hopTum-l ﬂies were set up with the same number of ﬂies used in ﬂight. Larval progeny, raised at 25C for 3 days, were
exposed to 10 male and 10 female G0 and S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps for 8 h. For each condition, hosts of the same strain were taken from
more than one vial to randomize samples and ensure robust egg-laying. Similarly, wasps of the same species from different vials were com-
bined for infections. Each experiment was replicated 3–4 times.
Infected larvae were randomly selected and examined under a dissecting microscope 3–5 days later for the presence of either melanotic
tumors or melanized parasite-induced encapsulation reactions. hopTum-l tumors and parasite capsules differ in shape; tumors are globular,
while capsules are typically sickle-shaped and surround a wasp egg or wasp larva. These structures can fragment into smaller, melanized
pieces, making it difﬁcult to distinguish them. Regardless of their identity, they were classiﬁed based on size: (a) specks (similar in appearance
to melanized crystal cells), (b) small melanized structures, or (c) large melanized structures. To quantify spaceﬂight’s effects on these reactions,
an arbitrary score was assigned as follows: 1–3 specks, 4–8 specks, and > 8 specks were assigned a value of 0.5, 0.75, or 1, respectively. Small-
and large-melanized structures were assigned a value of 1 and 4, respectively. Where clear encapsulation reactions (with evidence of a wasp
egg) were observed, the structure was also assigned a value of 4. A composite tumor and encapsulation (T + E) score was calculated from 16 to
29 G1/S1 Lb17-or Lh14-infected hopTum-l larvae. Uninfected G1/S1 hopTum-l larvae (70–89 animals) served as controls. Pairwise comparisons of
the average T + E scores were made using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.
Bulk RNA-Seq sample preparation methods
For RNA-Seq experiments (technique reviewed in68), samples were ﬂash-frozen in dry ice and stored at 80C. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis was
performed on RNA prepared from four replicates of (a) ground control (G0) and space-ﬂown (S0) adult ﬂies; (b) G0 and S0 adult wasps;
and (c) G1 and S1 larvae. The RNA/protein puriﬁcation plus kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. was used for RNA preparation, and the extracted
total RNA was stored in Norgen RNA isolation kit elution buffer.
For adult ﬂies, three males and females each, of (a) G0 y w; (b) S0 y w; (c) G0 hopTum-l; (d) S0 hopTum-l were used for extraction. RNA prep-
arations of G0 and S0 Lb17 and Lh14 wasps were made from three females and three males. Larval RNA was isolated from G1 and S1 y w
animals. In addition, RNA was also extracted from hopTum-l larvae as follows: (a) uninfected G1; (b) uninfected S1; (c) G0 Lb-infected G1 hosts;
(d) S0 Lb-infected G1 hosts; (e) G0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (f) S0 Lb-infected S1 hosts; (g) G0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (h) S0 Lh-infected G1 hosts; (i)
G0 Lh-infected S1 hosts; and (j) S0 Lh-infected S1 hosts.
The RNA from G0 and S0 adult ﬂies and wasps was processed at Genewiz, Inc. as follows: After poly (A)+ extraction, libraries for adult ﬂies
and wasps were prepared using the non-stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit E7775, following the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB,
Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were validated using the Agilent TapeStation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine
for HiSeq 2 3 150 bp, single index, at Genewiz. Data output was 300–350 million raw paired-end reads per lane.
The total RNA prepared from G1 and S1 larval samples (stored at 80C) was processed as follows at NASA’s GeneLab Samples Process-
ing Laboratory. The RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer, and 400 ng of each sample was used for poly (A)+
extraction. RNA-Seq sequencing libraries were prepared using the E7775 NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit, as above. The libraries were
validated by using Agilent TapeStation D1000 tape. Quantiﬁcation was performed using the Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer. Libraries were pooled
and sequenced on the Illumina iSeq 100 sequencer to conﬁrm library balancing and screen for ribosomal RNA. The ﬁnal library pool was
sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (300 cycles, 2 lanes).
Processing of Drosophila RNA-Seq data
The reads from adult ﬂy and larval ﬂy RNA were analyzed using version D of NASA GeneLab’s RNA-Seq processing pipeline (https://github.
com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md). For this, the raw
fastq ﬁles of the adult ﬂy RNA-Seq reads obtained from Genewiz were transferred to GeneLab. Raw fastq ﬁles of both sample sets were as-
sessed for percent rRNA (0.30–0.42% rRNA in adults; 0.20–2.73% rRNA in larvae) using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and ﬁltered using

Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 2.6). Raw and trimmed fastq ﬁle quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9),
and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports.
D. melanogaster STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.8a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release
101, genome version BDGP6.28 (Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation ﬁle: Drosophila_me-
lanogaster.BDGP6.28.101.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.8a). A ma-
jority (90.08%–94.47%) of trimmed reads mapped uniquely to the ﬂy reference genome. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using
the RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) and determined to be unstranded. Then aligned reads from all samples were quantiﬁed using
RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none.
RSEM raw gene counts were imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0)69 me-
dian of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were
compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. False discovery rate (adjusted
p value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment. Gene annotations were assigned using the
following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Dm.e.g.,.db (v3.12.0). Genes were
considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.
Analysis of Drosophila RNA-Seq results
Global analyses
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normal-
ized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.3). Volcano plots were created using
EnhancedVolcano (version 1.8.0), with adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values speciﬁed.
KEGG enrichment analyses for adult samples
DEGs in adult ﬂy samples (adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) were used for analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment an-
alyses were performed using the Bioconductor package ClusterProﬁler v 3.18.070 and the Drosophila database (org.Dm.e.g.,.db version 3.13).
EnrichGO and EnrichKEGG functions were used to determine functionally enriched GO categories for KEGG pathways and molecular func-
tion.71 Results were visualized by R package.72
Analysis of top, essential, and pathway DEGs
The most highly modulated Top DEGs in the adult ﬂy samples were identiﬁed by sorting log (2)-FC for each comparison and then ﬁltering
genes that met the adjusted p value signiﬁcance p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. From this list, the top 50 upregulated or downregulated genes
were identiﬁed for each comparison, yielding 280 genes. Annotations and other functional information for these 280 genes were examined
in FlyBase37 and genes with clear orthologs or paralogs and known or predicted functions (172 genes) were retained. Clustering of these 172
Top DEGs revealed six major expression proﬁles. The magnitude of log (2)-FC for these genes, in both directions, ranged from 3- to 12-fold.
For Essential DEGs, a list of 1,024 genes that were identiﬁed experimentally in P element insertion screens was compiled.73–76 Of these
1,024 genes, 137 were differentially expressed in at least one of four comparisons. The DIOPT-DIST tool,41 which predicts human orthologs
of ﬂy genes and diseases or traits associated with the human orthologs identiﬁed through GWAS or OMIM databases, was used to determine
the disease relevance of these essential genes. Genes in the JAK-STAT, Toll, and Imd pathways were compiled from KEGG and/or FlyBase.
Additional pathway target genes were added from the primary literature.34,77,78
For larval samples, gene set enrichment analysis of larval RNA-Seq results did not highlight immune changes, and hence the results of this
analysis were not included here. Gene expression changes were examined in the context of signaling pathways as was done for the adult RNA-
Seq results above.
Processing of parasite RNA-Seq reads
Raw fastq ﬁles were ﬁltered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq ﬁle quality was eval-
uated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. L. heterotoma Bowtie2 and RSEM
indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, and the Lh14 GAJC contig transcriptome reference
from NCBI (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JC/GAJC01/GAJC01.1.fsa_nt.gz). L. boulardi Bowtie2 and
RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, with Lb17 GAJA contig transcriptome reference
from NCBI (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JA/GAJA01/GAJA01.1.fsa_nt.gz).
Trimmed reads were aligned to the respective wasp parasite species Bowtie2 transcriptome reference with Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0), and
aligned reads from all samples were quantiﬁed using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantiﬁcation data was imported
to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) using the median of ratios method. Normalized
transcript counts were subject to differential expression analysis in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared
using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. The numbers of signiﬁcantly differentially ex-
pressed transcripts (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) for Lb17 and Lh14 were 293 and 310, respectively. The presence of conserved protein

Identiﬁcation and analysis of parasite EV transcripts
Proteins from puriﬁed Lb17 EV have not been characterized, but the composition of puriﬁed EVs from the Lb Gotheron (LbG) strain is pub-
lished.14 To identify differentially expressed Lb17 EV transcripts in space corresponding to these previously characterized 383 LbG EV pro-
teins, we queried the LbG EV protein sequences against all 293 differentially expressed Lb17 transcripts in space (Table S2; LbG EV query
sequences were kindly provided by J. Varaldi, University of Lyon). For this, NCBI’s tblastn tool was used at default settings (BLOSUM62;
gap costs existence extension 1, ﬁltered for low complexity regions, January 2023). Results where E-value %1 e30, query coverage
R50%, and percent identity of R50% were scored as high conﬁdence homologs and included 27 sequences. Two sequences did not
meet these criteria but were added to our results (Table 1), either due to their high log (2)-FC value (GAJA01001411.1; E = 3.00 e100, query
coverage 96%, and % identity 32.49), or due to interesting homology (GAJA01009829.1; E = 4.00 e30, query coverage 57%, and % iden-
tity 32.69).
An estimate of the overall Lb17 EV proteome size was obtained as follows: the 383 LbG sequences were used to tblastn-search the
GAJA00000000 sequences.47 This search identiﬁed 316 non-redundant EV protein-encoding GAJA sequences (E % 1 e50, query coverage
R70%, percent identity R70%; NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1).15,79–81 Some homologs were not identiﬁed due to strain differences; nevertheless, the
analysis revealed that most of the LbG EV proteins are expressed in the Lb17 female abdomen. Since the Lh14 EV proteome is already char-
acterized,11,12 tblastn analyses were not necessary, and EV genes were ﬁltered from the 310 Lh14 DEGs (Table 2).
SEM preparation of venom EVs and imaging
Thirty venom glands of G0 and S0 wasps were dissected in 100 mL of ice-cold PBS and ﬁxed in 100 mL of 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium
cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Venom glands were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging as fol-
lows: Ten drops of 2% osmium tetroxide aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were added to the sample on ice for 20 min.
The sample was ﬁltered on a wet 25-mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane ﬁlter (0.1 mm pore size), covered with a second wet ﬁlter,
and suctioned with the sample in between the ﬁlters. The ﬁlters were clamped between O-rings and quickly immersed in ice-cold distilled
water. The ﬁlters were then rinsed in distilled water ﬁve times, 3 min for each rinse. This was followed by dehydration in a graded (10%,
30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%) series of ethanol for 5 min each. The ﬁlters were then critical point dried (Balzers, CPD 030) in liquid
carbon dioxide ﬁve times, 3–5 min each. Dehydrated and dried samples were mounted on aluminum SEM specimen mount stubs (Electron
Microscopy Sciences) using conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stored in a 60C oven for 2 h or longer. Sam-
ples on the ﬁlter were coated with gold/palladium (Leica, EM ACE600) right before being observed on the Zeiss SUPRA 55VP scanning elec-
tron microscope. These procedures were carried out at the CCNY and CUNY ASRC core facilities.
Virulence assay for Lh14 venom
Forty hopTum-l larvae were bled in 200 mL of 7% bovine serum albumin. 50 mL of this hemolymph preparation was aliquoted into individual
chambers of a 4-chamber slide and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Venom was extracted from G0 and S0 Lh14 wasps,
and protein was quantiﬁed using the Bradford method. An appropriate volume of the venom extract containing 30 mg of venom protein
was added to the slide chamber with hopTum-l hemocytes. Phosphate-buffered saline (20 mM, pH 7.4) was used as a control. After incubation
for 4 h at 25C, excess liquid was removed by aspiration, hemocytes were air-dried at room temperature and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min. After washing, cells were stained successively with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pen-
tahydrate (Invitrogen) for 15 min each at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with PBS, and stained cells were mounted in
Vectashield for confocal microscopy. Lamellocytes with bipolar morphology (i.e., spindle-shaped GFP-positive lamellocytes with two pointed
ends) were manually scored. Experiments were replicated three times and the Student’s t test statistic was applied to determine the
signiﬁcance.
Isolation and characterization of L. heterotoma mutants
G0/S0 Lb17 and Lh14 male wasps were mated with females from lab cultures, and their grandsons were examined for viable mutations
affecting wing color, wing venation, wing morphology, eye color, eye morphology, and antennal morphology. Mutant grandsons were not
obtained from the G0/S0 Lb17 or G0 Lh14 screens. One Lh14 grandson with golden wings (instead of the normal gray wings) was identiﬁed.
This aurum1 male was mated with ‘‘lab’’ females; the progeny was ‘‘selfed’’ to obtain additional mutant males. For a pure-breeding stock,
putative heterozygous unmated females were collected by placing pupae into Falcon 3072 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson) 1–3 days prior

to their emergence. Strips of Scotch Tape (0.9 cm wide) were used to seal the wells. The aurum1 strain was homozygous viable, and a pure-
breeding stock was established.
A second mutant phenotype was observed in the aurum1 wasp culture. The posterior wing margins of this aurum1 wasp were angular
instead of the normal round ends. This mutant, kona1, assorted from the aurum1 mutation, and was similarly homozygous viable but a
pure-breeding stock could not be established as homozygous kona1 females could not infect hosts. To establish this, 14 unmated, or 11
kona1 male-mated, heterozygous or homozygous kona1 females, were introduced to y w hosts. Ten males were used for the matings. Larval
hosts were dissected to assess the presence of eggs.
To examine if aurum1 and kona1 mutations assort independently, unmated homozygous aurum1 females were mated with kona1 males.
Thirty-six unmated double heterozygous females were used for two rounds of y w infections. Over 1,000 male progeny of the four expected
genotypes were scored.
Ovaries from wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous kona1 females were ﬁxed in ethanol, mounted in 50% glycerol, and imaged on a
Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope attached to a Diagnostic Instruments Inc. camera and NIS Elements Imaging Software 64.0 bit
3.22.14. Ovipositors of 10 wild type and 30 homozygous kona1 females were gently pulled out using sharp forceps, brieﬂy dipped in 70%
ethanol and PBS, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in PBS, before mounting in Vectashield. Images were acquired with a Leica
Aperio CS2 microscope.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sample size, experimental replication, and data analysis of results are also described in the corresponding sections above and/or the corre-
sponding ﬁgure legend. For Figures 2 and S9, each experimental vial was considered a replicate, and statistical analysis of insect survival in
space relative to ground after their return to the lab was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016. The mean numbers (G standard error) of ﬂies and/
or wasps from 14 vials were calculated in Microsoft Excel (2016). Student’s t test statistic was applied, and the difference between the corre-
sponding space versus ground samples was signiﬁcant if p < 0.05. For the data in Figures 6D and 6E, the weighted average number of tumors
per animal in S0 versus G0 ﬂies, or S1 versus G1 ﬂies, was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The mean G standard error was calculated, and a
Student’s t test was used to determine biological signiﬁcance. For Figure 7B, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples
was performed to compare all conditions pairwise. p values < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. For Figure 9H, more than 1,000 F2 males were
scored from unmated dihybrid females, and the raw numbers obtained are shown. A standard chi-square test was applied to accept the null
hypothesis. For Figure 9I, at least 30 larvae per condition were dissected and scored for signs of infection. For Figure S11, the means of the
proportion of bipolar cells in the L. heterotoma virulence assay were compared in experimental versus control samples using Excel and a Stu-
dent’s t test. Between 129 and 1,146 lamellocytes were scored per replicate. For differential gene expression analysis in R using DESeq2, all
groups were compared using the Wald test. To generate the F statistic p value and false discovery rate (adjusted p value), the likelihood ratio
test was used. Corrections for multiple testing adjustment were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg. Genes were considered differentially
expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.
