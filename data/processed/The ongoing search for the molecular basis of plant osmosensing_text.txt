Introduction
Cell viability and metabolism depend on cytoplasmic 
water and solute content, and organisms have evolved 
mechanisms to sense changes in cell water content, sol-
ute concentrations, cell volume, and/or turgor. This 
Perspective addresses the response to osmotic challenge 
in land plants and describes their special dependence 
on cellular water status for growth and development. 
Understanding how plants cope with water limitation 
may allow us to mitigate the agricultural effects of 
drought, a critical limitation on global crop productivity 
that is likely to increase in severity as the climate changes 
(Long and Ort, 2010). The signaling pathways by which 
plants respond to osmotic challenge are intriguing from 
an evolutionary standpoint: some aspects of these path-
ways resemble those of fungal or mammalian cells, some 
are similar to prokaryotic mechanisms, and yet others 
are unique to plants (as described below and in Hamann, 
2012). In addition to the importance of osmotic ho-
meostasis in land plants, we will discuss some of the spe-
cific context and language of plant stress biology, and 
describe what is known (and not known) about the mo-
lecular pathways by which plants sense and respond to 
osmotic challenges.
The roles of water in plant biology
Plants can only take up water from the soil in which they 
are growing, and are unable to relocate to find more 
favorable water conditions. The majority of the water 
extracted from the soil by a plant’s roots travels rapidly 
up the plant through the vascular system, eventually to 
be lost via regulated pores in the leaf epidermis called 
stomata. This vertical movement of water within the plant 
mediates the root-to-shoot movement of nutrients, hor-
mones, and developmental signals. Importantly, open 
stomata are also the conduits through which gas is ex-
changed between the leaf and the atmosphere during 
photosynthesis. Thus, plants must continuously balance 
the advantages of efficient photosynthesis and solute 
transport with the drawbacks of water loss through open

stomata; how well they accomplish this task contributes 
to their water use efficiency, a key factor in drought re-
sponse (Long and Ort, 2010).
At the cellular level, water is critical for maintaining 
and controlling an important driving force in plant cells 
called turgor pressure. Much of a plant cell’s water—
and therefore most of its volume—is accounted for by 
the vacuole (a large intracellular organelle found in 
plants, fungi, and animals). In plants, the vacuole often 
takes up >80% of the cell volume, and one of its many 
functions is to maintain turgor via active transport of 
ions in and out of the vacuolar space (Hedrich, 2012). 
The plant cell plasma membrane is surrounded by a 
strong but elastic cell wall comprised of cellulose micro-
fibrils embedded in a gel of pectin, other carbohydrates, 
and protein. Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by 
the protoplast (all portions of the cell enclosed by the 
plasma membrane) against the cell wall. The amount of 
turgor pressure in a particular cell is determined by sev-
eral factors, including the osmotic difference that is gen­
erated by vacuolar and cytoplasmic solute accumulation 
and subsequent water uptake, and the elasticity of the 
cell wall (see Verslues et al., 2006, for additional expla-
nation). The turgor pressure of a plant cell can be as 
high as the pressure of a car tire; high turgor pressure is 
critical to give plants their rigidity and structure, drive 
cell expansion, mediate the opening and closing of sto-
mata, and allow movements like the closing of a Venus 
flytrap (Pritchard, 2001).
Terminology and concepts in plant osmosensing
Strictly defined, the term “osmosensing” refers to the 
direct perception of the osmolarity of the external or 
internal environment of a cell. This term is often used 
by plant researchers, but it is entirely possible that me-
chanical stimuli caused by change in membrane ten-
sion, cell wall damage, or the disruption of plasma 
membrane–cell wall connections are relevant factors 
in osmosensing, in addition to or instead of altered

Plant osmosensing
(2006). The measurement of water potentials allows for 
simple predictions regarding the direction of water fluxes 
and changes in turgor (Boyer and Kramer, 1995). Water 
potentials of 0 to 0.3 megapascals (MPa) are typical of 
well-watered plants, whereas water potentials of 1.5 to 
2.0 MPa represent severe stress and permanent loss of 
turgor for many plants including most crop species and 
the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, 
drought-adapted plants such as those found in deserts 
can grow at much lower water potentials, and both 
inter- and intra-species variation are emerging as impor-
tant tools in understanding plant osmosensing mecha-
nisms and adaptation to dry environments.
The term “hyperosmotic stress” is infrequently used in 
plant biology. This is because water limitation is rarely 
caused by the presence of high levels of extracellular 
solutes but is more often created by the unavailability of 
water (quantified as a decrease in water potential). The 
downstream effects of water limitation on plants that 
are commonly assayed include: the accumulation of com-
patible solutes such as proline, the induction of pro-
tective proteins such as dehydrins, the production of 
the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), and increased 
extracellular osmolarity per se (see Fig. 1). For the pur-
poses of this Perspective, “osmosensing” is used to include 
both the direct perception of osmotic imbalance across 
a membrane as well as the perception of indirect effects 
of osmotic imbalance on the membrane, cell wall, or 
membrane–cell wall system. We anticipate that as the 
molecular mechanism(s) for the perception of osmotic 
challenge becomes clearer, so will the terms used to de-
scribe these processes.
Plant water status is typically described in terms of 
“water potential,” a measure of the free energy status of 
water relative to pure water at a reference state. Water 
potential is derived from the chemical potential of water 
but is expressed in units of pressure, which makes it par-
ticularly useful in plant biology as a unified measure of 
soil and plant water status. Factors that decrease the free 
energy of water (such as increased concentration of dis-
solved solutes or adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces such 
as soil particles) make the water potential more nega-
tive, whereas factors that increase the free energy (such 
as increased turgor pressure) make the water potential 
more positive. Additional details of water potential can 
be found in Boyer and Kramer (1995) and Verslues et al. 
Figure 1.  Potential osmosensing mechanisms in plant cells. (A) Histidine kinases could be activated by osmotic imbalance across the 
plasma membrane, initiating a signal transduction pathway similar to the high osmolarity glycerol response 1 pathway in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. (B) Ion channels that are opened in response to planar membrane tension or membrane bending could respond to both 
protoplast swelling or shrinking. The release of ions in response to hypoosmotic swelling would be similar to the MscS/MscL “osmotic 
release valve” paradigm in Escherichia coli. In addition, the entry of Ca2+ through an opened MS ion channel could have downstream 
signaling properties. (C) Cell wall integrity-monitoring mechanisms could involve receptor-like kinases with extracellular domains 
capable of sensing the movement or disruption of cell wall components. The cell wall is presented as a gray box. The plasma membrane 
is represented as a bilayer of gray lipid molecules.

Molecular mechanisms of osmosensing
It is not fully known how plants initially sense any of the 
osmotic challenges described above. Three general mod-
els for osmosensing in plant cells are illustrated in Fig. 1. 
Below, we further describe the molecular mechanisms 
thought to underlie each of these molecular models and 
summarize the supporting experimental evidence.
(1) Osmotic imbalance across the plasma membrane. In 
theory, a protein embedded in the plasma membrane 
could directly sense changes in osmolarity outside the cell, 
perhaps via an osmotically regulated conformational 
change in an extracellular domain (Fig. 1 A; Parsegian 
et al., 1995). However, there is currently little experi-
mental support for this model in any eukaryotic system 
(interested readers are directed to the accompanying 
discussion of prokaryotic osmosensors in the Perspec-
tive by Wood). Several osmosensors involved in hyper-
osmotic signaling through the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
high osmolarity glycerol response (HOG)1 pathway, in-
cluding the histidine kinase Synthetic Lethal of N-end 
rule 1 (SLN1), were originally proposed to function in 
this manner, but recent data suggest that one or more 
of the other mechanisms listed below may instead be 
involved (Saito and Posas, 2012). Plant homologues of 
SLN1 have been reported to serve as regulators of water 
stress responses (Tran et al., 2007; Wohlbach et al., 2008). 
However, other data have raised questions as to whether 
these kinases could be the main plant osmosensing sys-
tem, as loss-of-function alleles have limited effects on 
key phenotypes such as the accumulation of ABA and 
osmoregulatory solutes (Kumar et al., 2013). Alterna-
tively, a novel calcium channel, reduced hyper­
osmolarity-induced [Ca2+]i increase (OSCA)1, 
has recently been reported to be activated by hyperos-
molarity and to be genetically required for several stress-
related phenotypes (Hou et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2014); 
additional physiological experiments are needed to fully 
understand the role of OSCA1 and related channels in 
drought response.
(2) Increased plasma membrane tension. It is easy to imag-
ine how hypoosmotic shock leads to increased plasma 
membrane tension; dehydration may have the same effect 
in plant cells because the plant plasma membrane and 
cell wall are physically linked at multiple locations. Upon 
plasmolysis, most of the protoplast separates from the 
cell wall, but thin strands of plasma membrane (Hechtian 
strands) remain connected. As a result, both shrinking 
and swelling of the protoplast could increase plasma 
membrane tension.
Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are capable of sens-
ing membrane tension and responding to it by facil­
itating the flux of osmolytes across the membrane 
(Fig. 1 B). Multiple families of MS ion channels have 
been identified in plant genomes, and numerous MS 
sensitivity to ABA treatment in physiological assays 
(Verslues and Juenger, 2011; Christmann et al., 2013). 
An illustration of the relevance of distinguishing be-
tween hyperosmotic stress and low water availability comes 
from simple treatments with extracellular solutions. Treat-
ing plants with a solution of low molecular weight sol-
utes such as NaCl will plasmolyze cells (a shrinking of 
the protoplast leading to its separation from the cell 
wall), whereas soil drying or treatment with large poly-
mers that cannot penetrate the cell wall (such as PEG) 
will cause cytorrhysis (shrinking of both protoplast and 
cell wall). These two types of treatment elicit very differ-
ent downstream responses and may in fact be perceived 
by different mechanisms. For example, root growth rate 
is much higher after cytorrhytic than plasmolytic treat-
ments of the same MPa (Verslues et al., 2006). Further-
more, cytorrhysis and plasmolysis can have different 
effects on plasma membrane–cell wall connections (per-
haps analogous to the effects of osmotic stress on focal 
adhesion complexes in mammalian cells; see below for 
further discussion), which in turn elicit different down-
stream signaling events.
Conditions under which plants experience  
osmotic challenges
Plants experience water stress when the water content, 
and therefore the water potential, of the soil decreases. 
In addition, plants growing in hot dry air can become 
dehydrated, even when the soil is relatively wet, if water 
cannot be taken up rapidly enough by the roots to com-
pensate for the water lost through stomata. Many plants 
regularly lose turgor during the day when the humidity 
of the environment is low relative to that inside the leaf, 
and stomates are open to support photosynthesis. They 
then rehydrate during the night when environmental hu-
midity is high and stomates are closed. In the laboratory, 
drought/water stress is imposed by withholding water 
from potted plants or by transferring plants to media 
with defined water potential (Verslues et al., 2006).
Hypoosmotic stress may occur transiently when dry soil 
is rapidly rewetted, and chronically upon repeated soil 
flooding. In the laboratory, hypoosmotic stress is typi-
cally reproduced by treating isolated cells with solutions 
of distilled water after equilibration in high levels of 
NaCl or mannitol. The phenomenon of water soaking, 
the accumulation of intercellular water during pathogenic 
invasion, promotes pathogen survival and may impose 
hypoosmotic stress on surrounding cells (Beattie, 2011). 
In addition, some stages of plant development necessar-
ily involve osmotic challenges, including the desiccation 
of seeds and pollen and their subsequent rehydration 
and resumption of metabolic activity. It is also possible, 
though not yet demonstrated, that the cell wall weaken-
ing associated with cell expansion during normal plant 
growth may have some of the same effects as hypoos-
motic stress.

Plant osmosensing
must be coordinated with that of the cytoplasm. Thus, 
the plasma membrane–based mechanisms described 
above are likely to be accompanied by an analogous 
osmosensing system in vacuolar and organellar mem-
branes. However, little is known about these processes. 
The disruption of two plastid MSL channels constitu-
tively activates low water potential responses, including 
ABA production and sensitivity, proline biosynthesis, 
and solute accumulation (Wilson et al., 2014). Vacuole 
membrane–localized members of the TPK family were 
recently shown to be modulated by membrane tension 
and might serve a similar role (Maathuis, 2011). Thus, 
although MS channels have traditionally been associated 
with protection from extracellular hypoosmotic shock, 
they are also important in coordinating the osmotic status 
of intracellular compartments and have an as yet unde-
fined connection to physiological mechanisms important 
to low water potential response.
Connecting perception to response: Osmotic stress 
signaling pathways
Downstream osmotic stress signaling pathways have re-
ceived a great deal more attention than the initial per-
ception of water deficit. Interestingly, stress-responsive 
solute accumulation in plant cells may share some mech-
anisms with solute accumulation in bacterial cells (see 
accompanying Perspective by Wood). Other responses, 
such as the induction of protective proteins and stress-reg-
ulated gene expression, appear to involve plant-specific 
mechanisms, some of which depend on stress-induced 
increases in ABA levels (Yoshida et al., 2014).
Many studies have characterized the extensive changes 
in intracellular calcium, transcriptional regulation, epi-
genetic modification, and posttranslational protein mod-
ification (especially phosphorylation) that occur in plants 
in response to hyperosmolarity, water limitation, and 
ABA (Verslues and Juenger, 2011; Christmann et al., 
2013). In addition, the molecular mechanisms of ABA 
perception are now known in detail (Cutler et al., 2010). 
Although some of the genes induced or proteins modi-
fied in response to water limitation have clear roles in 
signaling, the synthesis or import of specific solutes and 
ions, or protection against reactive oxygen species, the 
functions of many other stress-induced genes are less 
clear. A great deal of transcriptomic and proteomic 
data is being generated, but these data can be challeng-
ing to interpret because of the difficulty in distinguish-
ing ABA-dependent signaling events from events that 
are directly related to osmosensing or mechanosensing. 
For example, several members of the SnRK2 family of 
plant-specific kinases are key players in ABA signaling 
and can be activated by exogenous ABA in the absence 
of osmotic stress. However, other SnRK2s cannot be ac-
tivated by ABA but can still be rapidly activated by os-
motic stress (Boudsocq et al., 2007). How activation of 
these latter SnRK2s is connected to osmotic stress is not 
ion channel activities have been detected in plant mem-
branes (Monshausen and Haswell, 2013). The mid1-
complementing activity (MCA) proteins, a family 
of putative MS ion channels, promote Ca2+ influx in re-
sponse to hypoosmotic shock and mechanical stimulus 
in several plant species (Kurusu et al., 2013). Although 
no defect in the response to hypoosmotic shock or water 
deficit has been reported in mca mutants, Arabidop-
sis MCA1 is required for a normal response to cell wall 
damage and for efficient root growth into a hard agar 
medium (Hamann, 2012; Kurusu et al., 2013). Members 
of two other MS ion channel families, the MscS-Like 
(MSL) channels and the Two-Pore K+ (TPK) channels, 
function in organelles (see below). An osmosensing func-
tion for plasma membrane–localized MSL or TPK chan-
nels has yet to be thoroughly investigated.
C. Altered cell wall integrity. The cell wall–plasma mem-
brane interface is a critical site for detecting stimuli gen­
erated by changing water status. The Hechtian strands 
described above are reminiscent of focal adhesions of 
mammalian cells and, like focal adhesions, can be dis-
rupted by treatment with peptides that harbor the amino 
acid motif RGD (Canut et al., 1998). This has led to 
the hypothesis that focal adhesion–like complexes may 
exist in plants and serve to sense alterations in plasma 
membrane–cell wall attachments caused by dehydration. 
Although direct orthologues of mammalian proteins 
such as integrins have not been found in plants, molec-
ular modeling has uncovered an Arabidopsis protein with 
an integrin-like structure that may play a role in osmo-
regulation (Knepper et al., 2011).
Alternatively, plant osmosensing might bear similarities 
to cell wall monitoring mechanisms in yeast (Hamann, 
2012; Monshausen and Haswell, 2013). An osmosensor 
could bind directly to cell wall proteins, or mechanical 
change or cell wall damage could cause the release of 
specific molecules that are perceived by the osmosensor 
(Fig. 1 C). More than 600 receptor-like kinases are en-
coded by the Arabidopsis genome, and it is thought that 
some of these have drought signaling functions (Marshall 
et al., 2012). For example, THESEUS and FERONIA 
have lectin-like extracellular domains that may monitor 
cell wall status by binding directly to cell wall–derived 
carbohydrates or glycoproteins (Cheung and Wu, 2011). 
Another family of receptor-like kinases implicated in 
cell wall integrity is the Wall-Associated Kinase family 
(Kohorn and Kohorn, 2012). Genetic and biochemical 
studies support a model wherein Wall-Associated Kinases 
bind pectin, a component of the plant cell wall, and 
subsequently serve to control cell expansion through an 
unknown signal transduction pathway.

or turgor in the proper cell biological context and in a 
noninvasive manner would likely be transformative for 
the field. Finally, the cytoskeleton is intricately involved 
in force sensing and controlling cell shape in mamma-
lian cells (see accompanying Perspective by Sachs and 
Sivaselvan) and is likely to have as-yet-undiscovered roles 
in the perception and signaling of osmotic stress in plants 
(in addition to controlling cell wall deposition and other 
properties). We anticipate that future work on all of 
these fronts from many laboratories will reveal the ways 
in which plant osmosensing is similar to osmosensing in 
other systems, and the ways in which it is unique to plants.

known. Even the key downstream responses—ABA ac-
cumulation, the accumulation of protective solutes, and 
the induction of protective proteins—have not been de-
finitively linked to signaling chains that lead all the way 
back to the initial perception of water limitation.
Many of the mechanisms described above are also 
likely to be involved in hypoosmotic signaling, but more 
research is needed to establish the precise nature of the 
pathway and identify the critical components. Hypoos-
motic stress administered to plant cells in suspension 
cultures elicits a rapid oxidative burst that depends on 
a phosphorylation cascade involving Mitogen-Activated 
Protein Kinase and/or Calcium-Dependent Protein Ki-
nase activation (Cazale et al., 1999; Romeis et al., 2001). 
The pathway is proposed to induce anion efflux, which 
is the driving force of osmoregulation in guard cells, but 
the molecular mechanism has not been determined.
Summary and outlook
Despite our strong motivation to understand plant os-
mosensing and signaling, plant scientists still have a 
great deal of work to do. Key goals for future investigation 
include: (a) determining the molecular identity of the 
osmosensing apparatus, as detailed here and illustrated 
in Fig. 1; (b) characterizing the nature of the osmotic 
stress response signaling pathways upstream of the phy-
tohormone ABA and distinguishing it from responses 
to other abiotic stresses; and (c) using a wider range of 
assays in genetic screens to include the full range of 
phenotypes relevant for plant adaptation to water-lim-
ited environments.
With regard to conclusively identifying plant osmo-
sensors, the primary limitation at the moment is that no 
candidate osmosensors have been conclusively linked 
to stress signaling and key stress phenotypes. This bot-
tleneck can be explained in part by redundancy; some-
thing as critical to plant life as monitoring and responding 
to water status probably involves multiple mechanisms. As 
described above, testing candidate genes that are ho-
mologues of known osmosensors in other systems is a 
start, but it will also be important to leverage the power 
of forward molecular genetic screens in Arabidopsis. For 
this to take place, phenotypic assays that are amenable 
to high throughput analysis and that either measure 
the primary stimulus of osmotic challenge or measure 
downstream responses directly regulated by osmosen-
sors are needed. A promising recent approach taken by 
several laboratories is to directly screen for altered cal-
cium fluxes in response to osmotic stress (for example, 
Yuan et al., 2014). Natural variation and genome-wide 
association analysis also provide new and promising 
ways to find key genes that may be difficult to discover 
by classic forward or reverse genetic screens (Verslues 
et al., 2014).
In addition, new tools that would allow one to mea-
sure osmolyte movement, ion flux, membrane tension,
