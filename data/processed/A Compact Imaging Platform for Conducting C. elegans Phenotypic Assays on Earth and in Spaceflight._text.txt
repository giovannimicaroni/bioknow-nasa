Abstract: The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is used in a variety of applications ranging
from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease modeling, and to space-biology
investigations. These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving
animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform
(CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans.
The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the
optical conﬁguration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides
capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for
temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with different C. elegans
substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microﬂuidic chips. We validate
the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in
good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the
phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the
simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to future C. elegans investigations on
the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload
weight and crew time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP desirable
for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in space.

1. Introduction
Whole-organism phenotypic assays are a foundational tool for basic biology investi-
gations, drug screening and disease-focused studies [1–4]. The nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans is particularly relevant for phenotypic screening due to its small size (≈1 mm),
fast reproductive cycle (≈3 days), short lifespan (≈3 weeks), amenability to genetic ma-
nipulation and signiﬁcant translational relevance [5–7]. Its small size and ease of culture
offer the ability to phenotype large populations offering statistical power, which can be
a challenge with vertebrate models. Whole-organism phenotypic readouts in C. elegans
typically involve examining animal behavior, locomotory prowess and survival in response
to changes in environment [8–15].
The numerous advantages that underscore the use of C. elegans as a genetic model on
Earth also translate to its use in spaceﬂight as a cost-effective organism to understand the
mechanisms underlying the effects of microgravity and radiation exposure on astronaut
health. Indeed, C. elegans have been ﬂown several times to the International Space Station
(ISS) [16–20]. The conducting of animal experiments on the ISS is associated with stringent
operational requirements on payload size, weight, crew time and safety [21,22]. C. elegans
offers a facile means to address these requirements, making it an efﬁcient model for space-
biology investigations.

Standard microscopes have been the workhorse for image-based whole-organism
phenotyping in C. elegans. The need to increase assay throughout and reduce costs has led
to the development of a variety of bespoke imaging solutions. Approaches range from the
use of scanners for parallel imaging of nematodes on agar plates [23,24] to compact do-it-
yourself (DIY) systems based on Raspberry Pi cameras [25–27] and smartphones [10,28,29].
Scanners offer a convenient means to increase C. elegans assay throughout, but are bulky
and generate heat that requires signiﬁcant customization to maintain temperature during
the assay [23]. The Raspberry Pi camera approach offers on-board computation, making it
attractive; however, it requires an external display for viewing and keyboard, which can be
cumbersome, especially for ISS experiments.
The smartphone microscopy approach has promise to create compact, portable C. elegans
imaging systems with high-resolution displays and on-board computation. Current meth-
ods focus on high-magniﬁcation and multi-contrast imaging of C. elegans, lending to the
inclusion of optical and mechanical elements [10,26,28,29]. These elements increase the
complexity of the optical conﬁguration and system size/weight. Considerations on power
requirements, parallel experimentation and assay temperature control have received less
attention, which are essential for spaceﬂight studies. Since C. elegans assays are conducted
in a variety of substrates, compatibility with these substrates will broaden the utility of
such compact systems. Finally, thorough validation and mutant phenotypic data needs to
be generated from smartphone microscopy studies that will lower barriers for adoption in
research and educational settings.
In this study, we report a small foot-print smart-device imaging system called Compact
Imaging Platform (CIP) that can acquire videos of C. elegans in agar plates, liquid droplets
on a glass slide and microﬂuidic devices. The system has no external optical or mechanical
elements, thereby reducing the complexity for imaging. The CIP is powered by USB
and can be housed in standard incubators offering a plug-and-play approach for science
investigations on Earth and in space. We conducted validation and mutant studies on Earth
to show the promise of CIP for C. elegans phenotypic assays.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Description of the Compact Imaging Platform and Its Components
Design considerations such as light weight, compactness and low power consumption
are not only relevant for Earth-based C. elegans applications, but become essential for
spaceﬂight studies. For example, the ISS is a closed environment with limited workspace
for conducting experimental investigations; moreover, payload size and weight become
crucial factors dictating whether an experiment should be launched. Considering these
needs, we designed and built a compact imaging platform (CIP). As shown in Figure 1,
CIP is a small unit with length L = 7.5′′, width W = 4.5′′ and height, H = 5.5′′, occupying a
footprint area of ≈34 in2 and weighing ≈700 g. The footprint is primarily determined by
the need to accommodate the smartphone system, a fan for temperature control and the
C. elegans substrate.

Figure 1. Design of the Compact Imaging Platform and its functional capabilities. (a) The CIP consists
of an imaging station to hold iPod Touch for imaging, a C. elegans substrate and a cooling fan for
temperature control. It is powered by a 5 V USB cable. (b) The bottom section of the CIP showing the
LED array and the USB component housing. (c) Multiple CIP units powered with a USB hub with
the illumination turned on/off using a programmable timer. (d) Five CIP units stacked, operated in
parallel and placed in an incubator with the timer.
The mechanical design of the CIP is simple. It consists of two sections made from
Polyamide 12 nylon material and printed using a multi-jet fusion 3D printer (HUBS,
Chicago, IL, USA). The two sections are connected by hinges that allows their opening and
closing (Figure 1a). The top section houses the iPod Touch camera (Apple Inc, Cupertino,
CA, USA), and the bottom section houses the C. elegans substrate, 6500 k pure white LED
lights (Power Practical Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and a 6000-rpm cooling fan (Wathai,
China) (Figure 1b). Thin rectangular slots of 20 mm × 2 mm are provided on the top and
bottom sections, acting as air vents to achieve thermal equilibrium when the CIP is placed
in a temperature-controlled environment. The thermal management system of the CIP
works independently of the gravitational environment (ground or microgravity), due to
active cooling and proper ventilation present in the system.
The imaging conﬁguration of the CIP involves dark-ﬁeld imaging of C. elegans sam-
ples by using a ﬁxed-height illumination source and the iPod Touch camera. The white
LED lights in the bottom section are secured along the four walls, providing sidewise
illumination to the specimen. No external optical elements or mechanical focusing is
needed, making the design simple and user friendly. Autofocusing is achieved using a
3rd-party app (FiLMiC Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) on the iPod Touch. This app also allows for
adjustment of the magniﬁcation, ﬁeld of view and frame rate of video acquisition. The ﬁxed
focal distance conﬁguration gives a ﬁeld of view of 15 mm × 23 mm to 38 mm × 68 mm
depending on the optical 3x zoom available on the app. Videos can be acquired at 1080p
resolution with a frame rate of 3–30 fps, or time-lapse imaging can be performed with a
delay ranging from 1–60 s.

A smart-device camera such as the iPod Touch was chosen not only because of its
ease of use on Earth, but also because of the speciﬁc advantages it provides for C. elegans
experiments on the ISS. Unlike bulky conventional microscopy systems, it is a compact
integrated imaging system that not only has optical elements for visualization, but also has
a display (rather than a computer monitor) that allows the crew to inspect the animals and
image quality. Additionally, the iPod Touch has the capacity to store up to ≈250 GB worth
of data, allowing for recording of up to ≈810,000 images which enables short-term (e.g.,
about 1800 movies of 1.5 min duration at 5 fps) and long-term behavioral assays (e.g., about
45 h at 5 fps). Image acquisition aspects such as autofocusing and video capture rate can
be easily controlled using the installed app. Finally, conducting science experiments with
specialized hardware on the ISS requires signiﬁcant astronaut training; however, the crew
is familiar with using smartphone devices and associated apps, making our smart-device
approach crew-friendly for spaceﬂight experiments.
The CIP, integrated with the smart-device camera, is a 3 W (5 V, 0.6 A) low-powered
system that can be battery operated if needed. The electrical requirement involves powering
the LED lights and the cooling fan. Both elements are powered by a 5 V USB wall charger
and a USB Type-A to Type-A cable. We chose this method because battery packs are
available that can directly power our CIP using USB cables. This makes the CIP unit
portable for ﬁeld, educational and outer space applications. Thus, the operational simplicity
of the CIP makes it attractive, compared to standard microscopes, to pursue phenotypic
studies in C. elegans on Earth and for spaceﬂight studies.
A major advantage of the USB-powered CIP unit is that multiple units can be pow-
ered simultaneously using a multi-port hub without the need for individual wall chargers
(Figure 1c). In addition, a programmable timer can be added that controls illumination
intervals for long-term assays. The plug-and-play nature of the CIP and its small footprint
allows the parallel operation of several units inside a standard incubator (Figure 1d) with
desired temperature control. This new capability allows multiple assays with the same
or different strains to be conducted simultaneously in the same substrate or in different
substrates (plates, microﬂuidic chips etc.). The ability to house the CIP in an incubator is
also conducive for spaceﬂight investigations, as the ISS accommodates several incubators.
For example, the Space Automated Bioproducts Laboratory (BioServe Space Technologies,
Boulder, CO, USA) is a dual-function freezer/incubator that supports life-sciences exper-
iments on the ISS with a temperature control of −5 to 43 ◦C and accommodates 2 USB
ports [30].
2.2. Compatibility of the CIP with Different C. elegans Substrates
Phenotypic assays in C. elegans often involve imaging animals placed on a variety
of substrates, ranging from agar plates to liquid drops on glass slides to microﬂuidic
devices. Here, we imaged wild-type animals crawling on agar plates, which is a translucent
medium of thickness ≈5 mm (Figure 2a); animals swimming in sessile liquid drops of
peak height ≈2 mm that partially wet a glass-slide (Figure 2b); and animals crawling in a
microﬂuidic pillar chip that is ﬁlled with a liquid (Figure 2c) [12]. Each of these substrates
have different refractive indices, optical path lengths and interfaces, which can alter the
transmission of light and therefore can affect image contrast. Versatile imaging systems
need to be capable of visualizing animals in these different substrates. We therefore tested
the ability of the CIP to obtain sufﬁcient-quality images when adult animals are housed in
different substrates.

Figure 2. Compatibility of the CIP with various C. elegans substates. (a) Imaging of animals crawling
on a 3 cm agar plate (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 24
animals. The green dye region indicates the bacterial lawn. (b) Imaging of animals thrashing in liquid
drops (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 3 animals per
drop. The ﬁeld of view allows imaging of 6 wells. (c) Imaging of animals crawling in a microﬂuidic
pillar arena (left). The actual (middle) and processed (right) image are also shown with n = 51
animals in the arena. The images were processed using Image J V 1.53 (NIH, Maryland, USA),
wrMTrck plugin.
An important aspect of image-based assays in C. elegans is the analysis of images to
quantify phenotypic readouts. Standard image processing techniques, for example, based
on thresholding the intensity of the target objects against background intensity, work best
when there is sufﬁcient intensity contrast between the object and the background, and
the objects occupy enough pixels for successful detection. Figure 2 shows representative
images obtained from the three substrates using the CIP. We ﬁnd that the images from these
substrates are of sufﬁcient quality such that the adult animals can be easily segmented
using standard image processing software (ImageJ [31,32], wrMTrck plugin [33]). Under
optimal imaging conditions, we ﬁnd day 1 gravid adults to occupy ≈50 pixels when housed
in the three substrates. This resolution allows these animals to be segmented easily against
the background. Because of the ﬁeld of view and the types of substrates, we ﬁnd that the
CIP is well suited to obtain phenotypic data from ≈20–50 animals, with the large-arena
microﬂuidic chip providing data on more animals.

2.3. Controlling CIP Temperature during C. elegans Assays
C. elegans’ behavior and survival is sensitive to temperature [34–36]. In addition, assays
purposefully expose animals to different temperatures to investigate genes or compounds
that impact thermotolerance [37,38]. Thus, C. elegans assays necessitate control over the
environmental temperature. Often, the agar plates or microﬂuidic devices are kept in
a temperature-controlled incubator and taken out for imaging on standard microscopes
at room temperature. Alternatively, the temperature of these C. elegans substrates are
controlled by passive or active thermal management strategies. Scanners use fans to
control temperature [23], while some studies have used Peltier elements integrated with
microﬂuidic devices assays [39].
The small size of the CIP system allows it to be placed in a temperature-controlled
incubator (Figure 1d). The design of the CIP makes it an enclosed system housing the
C. elegans substrates, since the top section (containing the smart-device camera) is brought
in contact with the bottom section during imaging. The Initial trials showed that the main
internal source of heat that the C. elegans substrates experience in the CIP is the radiant
energy from the array of LED lights in the bottom section, which leads to an increase
in temperature. To address this issue, we created ventilation slots in the enclosure and
installed a cooling fan at the left wall of the bottom section. The forced convection from the
cooling fan draws air from the ambient and distributes it through the ventilation slots.
To test the ability to control the temperature of the C. elegans substrate housed in the
CIP, we conducted experiments in which the system was placed in the incubator along with
two temperature data loggers—one in the LED chamber and the other on the microﬂuidic
chip (Figure 3a). This experiment was conducted for three set temperatures of 15 ◦C, 20 ◦C,
and 25 ◦C of the incubator, and measurements were taken for 24 h. As shown in Figure 3b,c,
in less than 2 h, the temperature stabilizes for all three set temperature conditions, with
a variation that is less than 0.5 ◦C. We also note that the CIP temperature is about 1 ◦C
above the set temperature, due to local heating, which can be compensated by lowering the
incubator temperature. Thus, adequate temperature control can be achieved for C. elegans
assays using the CIP.

chip and in the LED chamber. (b) Temperature proﬁle collected over 24 h at set incubator tem-
peratures of 15 ◦C, 20 ◦C, and 25 ◦C. The temperature data of LED chamber and the microﬂuidic
chip are nearly identical. (c) Table showing mean temperature and standard deviation from all the
three collection points.

2.4. Validation of the CIP with Behavioral Assays on Different C. elegans Substrates
The CIP is a simple-to-use phenotyping system for C. elegans assays. In this section,
we validate the system by performing standard behavioral assays on plates, liquid drops
and microﬂuidic chips. We initially tested wild-type animals on Nematode Growth Media
(NGM) plates to quantitate the locomotory readouts (Figure 4) obtained from the CIP and
compare them with the data reported in literature. The CIP set up was similar to that
shown in Figure 2a. Videos were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps, and data were analyzed
with the wrMTrck plugin in ImageJ. Figure 4a shows the trajectory overlay that provides a
qualitative visualization of the animal behavior on plates (Refer to SI Video 1 for processed
video). We extracted the average forward speed and body wave frequency, and found the
values to be ≈0.14 mm/s and ≈0.39 Hz (Figure 4d,e). These values are close to the reported
values of ≈0.20 mm/s and ≈0.30 Hz in the literature [40,41].

Next, we tested the same animals in microﬂuidic chips that have an array of micropil-
lars arranged in a square lattice, with a gap of 90 µm between pillars. Videos were recorded
for 5 min at 10 fps. Figure 4b shows the trajectory overlay of animals crawling in the
microﬂuidic chip (Refer to SI Video 2 for processed video). The average forward speed and
body wave frequency were found to be ≈0.10 mm/s and ≈0.25 Hz (Figure 4d,e). In pillar
arenas, the forward speed and body frequency depend on the pillar lattice arrangement and
the animal conﬁnement between the pillars [15,42,43]. Our locomotory data from the CIP
is in good agreement with that of Rahman et al. [14], who reported values of ≈0.13 mm/s
and ≈0.21 Hz.
We also tested the same animals in a liquid drop on a glass slide with eight Teﬂon
wells 8 mm in diameter. We transferred three animals in 25 µL of NGM liquid. Videos
were recorded for 5 min at 10 fps. Figure 4c shows the trajectory of the overlay of animals
swimming in the liquid drop (Refer to SI Video 3 for processed video). The average forward
speed and body wave frequency were found to be ≈2.30 mm/s and ≈1.68 Hz (Figure 4d,e).
This swim data are close to the reported values of ≈2.71 mm/s and ≈1.76 Hz in the
literature [40].
2.5. Phenotypic Studies with Mutants
C. elegans has been an invaluable model organism for identifying the genetic basis of
behavior and locomotion. There are many mutants that have been identiﬁed and classiﬁed
based on automated image analysis, creating a behavioral database [44,45]. Since the CIP
can accommodate a variety of C. elegans substrates, it could be a useful tool to perform
phenotypic studies with mutants. Here, we conduct a pilot study with a wild type and two
mutants—unc-32(e189) and unc-79(e1068). Hierarchical clustering showed that these two
mutants exist in a different phenotypic space in the behavioral database [45], thus forming
a testbed to evaluate the capabilities of the CIP.
The unc-32 gene encodes the alpha subunit of a vacuolar ATP-ase (v-ATPase), an ATP-
dependent proton pump which functions to regulate neurotransmitter trafﬁcking through
synaptic vesicles and cell acidiﬁcation [46]. The unc-32(e189) mutation results in a reverse
ventral coiling phenotype in the posterior region of the animals. Likewise, the unc-79
gene encodes a large cytosolic protein that is thought to regulate the post transcriptional
processing of key voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels [47,48]. The unc-79(e1068)
loss-of-function mutation results in a “fainting” phenotype that presents as repeating
episodes of short bursts of normal movement that abruptly, but momentarily, stops [49].
Such unc-79 mutants have also shown to be defective in their ability to transition from
crawling to swimming [50], a subtle behavioral phenotype that was previously undetectable
using classical behavioral metrics. The unc-32(e189) was previously characterized using
plate-based methods and has not been assessed in any other environment. We conducted
thrashing and behavioral assays with the wild type and mutant animals to determine
whether these assays, conducted with the CIP, could identify phenotypic differences.
Figure 5 shows the thrashing frequency for the three strains, which was scored man-
ually from the 1 min videos acquired from the CIP at 10 fps. The thrashing frequency of
wild type, unc-32(e189) and unc-79(e1068) is ≈1.57, 0.07 and 1.29, respectively, indicating
that mutants have swim defects compared to wildtype, and unc-32(e189) has the strongest
swim deﬁciency. The value of the thrashing frequency for unc-79(e1068) obtained from the
CIP is in good agreement with that found in literature [50,51].
Next, we studied the crawling behavior of these strains in the microfluidic chip. Since the
microfluidic approach allows for the convenient removal and addition of reagents [12,13,52],
we studied changes in animal behavior in the presence and absence of food. To perform
this assay, day-4 animals were loaded into the chip, and on day 5 the food was removed,
followed by a 5-min wait time before imaging (Figure 6a). Subsequently, food was added
and imaging was performed after 5 min. The crawling tracks in Figure 6b,c visually reveal
not only individual strain differences, but also show food-induced changes in behavior.

signiﬁcant difference compared to both unc-79 (p-value < 0.0001) and unc-32 (p-value < 0.0001)
mutants. n = 10 animals.; one-way ANOVA.

age speed and body bend frequency of animal in the presence of food. Wildtype, n = 155; unc-

=175, p-value < 0.0001 (avg. speed), p-value = 0.0.002 (body bend); alpha = 0.05 for all analysis,
nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test.

From the acquired videos, we quantiﬁed changes in the average forward speed and
body wave frequency (Figure 6d,e). In the absence of food, the average forward speed of
the mutants is statistically different from wildtype (Figure 6d, left) with unc-32(e189) being
slower than unc-79(e1068). The body wave frequency of wildtype animals is higher than
the mutants, but there is no difference between the mutants themselves.
In the presence of food, the average forward speed of the mutants is still statistically
different from the wildtype (Figure 6e, left), although the values tend to be lower compared
to those in the absence of food. Interestingly, the mutants do not show signiﬁcant differences
in forward speed when food is present. With regards to body wave frequency, there is no
apparent difference between the three strains.
Thus, the data from the CIP shows that the thrashing frequency in liquid and the for-
ward crawling speed in the absence of food are better phenotypes to distinguish the strains.
These results highlight that the CIP is a versatile tool to conduct mutant phenotyping
studies using different C. elegans substrates.
2.6. Relevance of CIP for C. elegans Spaceﬂight Studies
Signiﬁcant physiological changes occur during long-duration space travel, necessitat-
ing a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that induce these alterations [53,54].
Thus, model organisms such as C. elegans have been ﬂown to the International Space Station
(ISS) several times for space-biology investigations [16–19,55–60]. For spaceﬂight missions
where payload size and weight are critical considerations, C. elegans experimental payloads
offer a small-form factor and a signiﬁcant reduction in weight compared with vertebrates.
Moreover, the fast reproductive cycle enables multi-generational studies to be conducted,
providing an opportunity to explore physiological adaptations due to long-term habitation
in space. These advantages and mutant resources make C. elegans a leading invertebrate
animal model for spaceﬂight studies.
Despite several C. elegans studies on ISS, most of the spaceﬂight data is limited to
changes in gene expression and ﬂuorescent markers, and there is a dearth of whole-
organism phenotypic data. The major challenges for ISS investigations are the availability of
microscopy hardware, access to crew time to conduct the studies, and payload weight/size
requirements for imaging instrumentation. Standard microscopes available on ISS are
bulky, require signiﬁcant crew training, have a limited ﬁeld of view to do large-population
imaging, rely on bulky monitors for crews to visualize samples, and data store/transfer
needs are demanding. These limitations necessitate the need for custom-designed imag-
ing hardware for gathering whole-animal phenotypic data to understand the effects of
microgravity and radiation on C. elegans physiology.
The compact imaging system developed in this study addresses the current limitations
for phenotyping C. elegans on the ISS. The CIP has <1 kg payload requirement and occu-
pies < 1 ft3. It is simple to use for crews and is a USB-powered plug-and-play device. The
large ﬁeld of view enables the interrogation of animal populations and provides a robust
statistical evaluation of phenotypic data. Sample visualization and data storage needs are
integrated into a small form-factor smart-device. Video data could be returned to Earth,
and data analysis could be performed post-facto, thereby allowing the crew time to focus
more on worm sample loading and basic payload handling.
Different C. elegans substrates can be integrated into the CIP based on science re-
quirements, and the microﬂuidic chips are particularly appealing due to their enclosed
conﬁguration that allows the maintaining of a sterile environment and efﬁcient ﬂuid han-
dling. Nematode sample preparation usually occurs on Earth, with worm culture bags
being ﬂown to the ISS, where the crew extracts samples and injects into the microﬂuidic
chips. The authors have recently ﬂown to the ISS micropillar-based microﬂuidic devices
for muscle strength measurements in C. elegans [20], and the CIP is a valuable addition to
the imaging needs on the ISS.

3. Conclusions
In this study, we report a compact imaging platform and successfully demonstrated
that it can be used to acquire whole-organism phenotypic data using a variety of C. elegans
substrates. We show that good temperature control can be achieved for assays, and that mul-
tiple CIP units can be used if needed to conduct parallel experiments. The videos acquired
are compatible for analysis with established software tools. The C. elegans community con-
tinues to develop a variety of open-source image analysis tools [61] that could be potentially
used to analyze images acquired from the CIP to increase the depth of phenotyping.
The hardware of CIP as demonstrated here could be further improved. In addition
to the smart-device camera, additional high-magniﬁcation optics could be integrated to
provide higher-resolution images to pursue deep phenotyping, including access to organ-
level information. Although we used the iPod Touch in this study, the 3D-printed imaging
station concept can be extended to other low-cost cameras (e.g., Arducam series), along with
Raspberry Pi integration. Opportunities exist to integrate additional hardware elements
to study animal response to stimuli such as light, temperature and electric ﬁelds, which
will broaden the types of assays that can be conducted. With advances in computation and
artiﬁcial intelligence, apps could be custom-designed to integrate with a smart-device that
allows real-time image analysis, storage of assay metadata and data visualization.
In summary, the CIP is a simple, versatile, low-cost and small-footprint phenotyping
tool for C. elegans assays, that could be deployed in research and educational settings on
Earth in its current form. The CIP also presents a proof of concept for future setups for
space biology research and could be adapted for ISS-compatible hardware. In the future,
the system needs to undergo thorough ISS certiﬁcation in terms of ﬂammability, materials,
off-gassing, electromagnetic interface, etc., as the assessment of multiple factors like safety,
system reliability and long-term storage for equipment performance is necessary.
4. Materials and Methods
Worm culture. Animals were cultured in 60 mm nematode growth medium (NGM)
petri plates with 150–200 µL E. Coli OP50 at 20 ◦C. Synchronized animals at day 5 from
hatching were used in all the assays performed. For this paper, the strains used were
wild-type Bristol (N2), CB189 unc-32(e189) III., and CB1068 unc-79(e1086) III.
Plate assay. Twenty-four age-synced animals were transferred to 35 mm nematode
growth medium (NGM) petri plates. The plates were seeded 12 h prior to animal transfer so
that the bacteria lawn was fresh and thin to obtain good quality contrast between animals
and background.
Microﬂuidic chip assay. Microﬂuidic devices were fabricated using standard SU-8
soft lithography techniques [62] in polydimethyl(siloxane). The design of the micropillar
array is similar to that of Rahman et al., with a pillar diameter of 70 µm, gap of 90 µm and
a chamber height of 110 µm. Animals were loaded inside the chip using a 1 mL syringe
connected with a 0.032” ID Tygon tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) with a
stainless-steel coupler tube (Instech Labs, FL). Synchronized animals in an NGM plate
were ﬂooded with liquid NGM and then transferred to an empty plate. Using a syringe,
approximately 65 animals were aspirated from the plate and loaded inside the chip using
the loading port. The chip was then ﬂushed with liquid NGM, followed by an addition of
20 mg/mL E. coli OP50.
Thrashing assay. Synchronized animals in an NGM plate were ﬂooded with liquid
NGM and then transferred to an empty plate. Three animals with 25 µL of liquid NGM were
aspirated and transferred to each well of the glass slide (Tekdon Incorporated, Myakka City,
FL, USA).
Data analysis. To analyze the videos acquired from the plate and chip assay, we used
the open-source software Image J with the plugin called wrMTrck. For the wildtype movies,
thrashing data was also obtained using the wrMTrck plugin. For mutant thrashing assay,
we played each movie and manually counted the thrashes. Each assay’s data were initially
recorded in Microsoft Excel® (Version is 16.66.1) and then imported to GraphPad Prism
