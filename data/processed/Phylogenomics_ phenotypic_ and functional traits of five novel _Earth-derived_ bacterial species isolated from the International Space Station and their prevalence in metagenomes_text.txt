With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how 
the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes 
survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial 
tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station 
(ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive 
bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the 
environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% 
similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic 
affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% 
similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel 
species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared 
to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. 
Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses 
were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun 
metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed 
that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel 
species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of 
genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, 
prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated 
organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and 
defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic 
compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, 
it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type

III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was 
concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: 
Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM ­115933T), Leifsonia virtsii ­F6_8S_P_1AT 
(= NRRL B-65661T = DSM ­115931T), Leifsonia williamsii ­F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 
­115932T), Paenibacillus vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT (= NRRL B-65663T = DSM ­115940T), and Sporosarcina 
highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T (= NRRL B-65664T = DSM ­115943T). Identifying and characterizing the 
genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, 
is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the 
only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate 
potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within 
space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the 
safety and success of future space missions.
Multiple low-Earth orbit and lunar orbit space habitats are being planned by governmental and commercial enti-
ties as part of the newly revitalized space industry in the 2020s. Cleaning practices and microbial monitoring to 
ensure crew safety will likely be based on information garnered from studies of the International Space Station 
(ISS), which is the only space habitat currently in orbit with a long-term history of human habitation. Surfaces 
of the crew resupply ­vehicles1 and cargo destined to the ISS are cleaned to minimize microbial contamination 
and protect crew health. Nevertheless, the constant presence of human crew members (approximately six at 
any given time) on the ISS may lead to the shedding of microorganisms onto its surfaces, potentially causing 
recontamination and becoming dominant members of the habitat’s ­microbiome2. As a result, ISS surfaces are 
required to be routinely (once a week) cleaned to maintain a low biomass level (< ­104 CFU/100 ­cm2 bacteria 
and < 100 CFU/100 ­cm2 fungi)3.
Despite this rigorous cleaning and maintenance, it has been reported that some resilient microbes, albeit in 
low numbers, have adapted to microgravity conditions and ­persist4. Examples are the discovery of a novel bac-
terial genus found repeatedly in metagenomes, which has subsequently been isolated from ISS surfaces during 
further sampling ­campaigns5, and the isolation of the same clonal strains of Acinetobacter pittii from ISS surfaces 
during different years and sampling ­campaigns6. Characterizing the genomes and adaptation mechanisms of 
rare or novel species that manage to recolonize ISS surfaces is important because rare species are more likely to 
have narrow niche breadth, and so are persisting due to adaptive mechanisms to the stresses of radiation, desic-
cation, and microgravity conditions rather than via generalist strategies. Such microbes are therefore also fertile 
grounds for biotechnology applications research.
Characterizing novel microbial species on the ISS is crucial for monitoring microbial contamination and 
protecting astronaut health. The process of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization 
of any novel microbial species found on the ISS helps to identify potential pathogens, as well as to understand 
potential impact on the spacecraft and its equipment (for example, in biofouling). Easily detecting or identifying 
a potential microbial threat, whether it be to human health or to the operation of the spacecraft or space station, 
depends on having an up-to-date, comprehensive database of microbial genomes, their species identity and 
their phenotypic characteristics (for example, are they known to carry or easily acquire antimicrobial resistance 
genes, are they UV resistant, what types of surfaces are they more likely to be found on, etc.). This is particularly 
the case when genetic information about a microbial threat is collected via shotgun metagenomic sequencing 
rather than by whole genome sequencing of pure culture; in that case, accurate identification relies entirely on 
an accurate database. The process of characterizing the previously unsequenced cultivable microbiome of space 
habitats continues to reduce the amount of microbial ‘dark matter’ found in metagenomic sequencing results.
In the ongoing Microbial Tracking (MT) investigation of the ­ISS7,8, out of 510 genomes sequenced, 56 micro-
bial species have been isolated multiple times, representing 27 microbial genera (19 bacteria and 8 fungi). Domi-
nant microbial species include bacterial genera Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Acinetobacter, yeast 
genus Rhodotorula, and fungal genera Penicillium, Aureobasidium, and Aspergillus9–25. In this communication, 
six strains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces belonging to five novel bacterial species constitut-
ing four different genera (Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina) are described. Since recent 
bacterial taxonomy heavily depends on genomic characterization, WGS of these novel species were generated 
and compared with publicly available genomes of closely related species.
One of the objectives of this study was to establish these six strains as novel species, for which chemotaxo-
nomic, phenotypic, physiological, and phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes) analyses were carried out. 
To discover the phylogenetic placement within their respective genera, we have employed multiple gene analyses 
and WGS-based phylogenies containing all shared single-copy core genes. The second objective was to quan-
tify the abundance of these recently identified species in the metagenomes of ISS surfaces. Hence, an in-depth 
analysis was conducted on the metagenomes collected during seven different flight missions, consisting of 106 
individual samples, to assess the presence and prevalence of the species. In addition, an attempt was made to 
generate metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of these novel species from the ISS metagenomes. Finally, 
antiSMASH analysis was performed to identify, annotate, and analyze secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene 
clusters (BGCs) in the genomes of these novel bacterial species. Specialized metabolites and natural products 
encoded by these novel bacterial BGCs might provide insight into how different bacterial species thrive and 
interact in ISS conditions.

Materials and methods
Sample collection and isolation
During the MT-1 and MT-2 mission series, samples were collected from the same set of eight surfaces aboard the 
ISS using pre-packaged and pre-sterilized ­wipes7,8. Upon return to Earth, among other strains belonging to previ-
ously defined species, six strains were isolated from both the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) plat-
form and crew quarters when grown on blood agar (37 °C for 24 h) or R2A (25 °C for 7 days) media which were 
unable to be assigned to a known species and were suspected to be novel. Preliminary 16S rRNA gene sequence 
analysis indicated that strains isolated during Flight 3 (n = 1) from the ARED platform (IIF3SC-B10T) and Flight 
6 (n = 5) from both the ARED platform (F6_3S_P_1B and ­F6_3S_P_1CT) and crew quarters ­(F6_8S_P_1AT, 
­F6_8S_P_1BT and F6_8S_P_1C) belonged to four different genera: Arthrobacter, Leifsonia, Paenibacillus, and 
Sporosarcina. However, further WGS analysis is required to identify the strains at the species level.
Light microscopy and SEM
A liquid culture of spore-forming strains was heat shocked (80 °C for 10 min), then plated on Tryptic Soy Agar 
(TSA) and grown at 30 °C for 5 days to induce endospore formation. Endospore staining with malachite green 
and safranin was performed using the Schaeffer-Fulton ­method26. Light microscopy and phase contrast images 
were taken on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera using Olympus cellSens software.
All strains were grown out on TSA media at 24 °C for 72 h. An isolated colony was fixed in a 4 °C solution of 
2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, United States) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (NaCaco) (Sigma 
Aldrich) for an hour. The suspended cells were collected using a vacuum pump and a 0.2 µm Isopore filter mem-
brane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, United States), and then transferred into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. The 
sample was incubated in 0.1 M NaCaco solution at 4 °C for 10 min and then replaced with fresh 0.1 M NaCaco 
solution; this washing step was repeated a total of 3 times. The sample then went through dehydration by a step 
series of increasing IPA and water solutions at 10 min intervals. The series was: 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 
100%, with the final 100% rinsing occurring 3 times. The sample was stored at 4 °C in 100% IPA until it was then 
critically point dried in a Tousimis Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Rockville, MD, United States). 
Samples were affixed with carbon tape to SEM stubs (Ted Pella Inc.) and then were coated in a ~ 12 nm thick 
carbon layer by a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Deerfield, IL, United States). SEM images were col-
lected on a FEI Quanta 200F microscope (Themo Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States) located at the California 
Institute of Technologies Kavli Nanoscience Institute.
Biochemical tests and phenotype characterization
Growth temperature and other phenotypic parameters of the tested strains were assessed as follows. Bacterial 
strains were inoculated in both solid (R2A plates) and liquid (trypticase soy broth (TSB), BD Diagnostics Cat 
# 257107) media in 15 ml loose-capped centrifuge tubes and grown at temperatures of 4, 15, 25, 30, 37, and 
45 °C. Growth on plates and in tubes was monitored daily for 7 days, and incubation was halted if growth was 
observed. Samples grown at 4 °C and 15 °C were incubated for an additional 4 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively, 
for final growth assessment. Salt tolerance was determined by inoculating the strains onto R2A plates contain-
ing 0–5% added NaCl, as well as agar containing only peptone plus 0 or 1% NaCl and examining growth after 
7 days of incubation at 30 °C. Oxidase activity was determined by using OxiDrops™ Liquid Oxidase Reagent 
(Hardy Diagnostics) on solid culture. Catalase activity was determined by observing effervescence when bacterial 
colonies were mixed with hydrogen peroxide on a sterile glass slide. Finally, pH tolerance (4 to 10) was tested by 
adjusting the pH of TSB broth with biological buffers, as described in Xu et al.27.
Biochemical tests were performed for each strain using a Gram-positive identification card (Vitek 2 GP ID, 
bioMérieux) according to manufacturers’ protocol. Briefly, freshly grown colonies were transferred aseptically 
into a saline (aqueous 0.45% to 0.50% NaCl, pH 4.5 to 7.0) tube to prepare homogenous suspension with a den-
sity equivalent to a McFarland No. 0.50 to 0.63 using a calibrated VITEK® 2 DensiCHEK™ Plus. The suspension 
tube and Vitek 2 GP ID card were placed in the cassette and incubated at 37 °C. Data entry, cassette loading to 
instrument and retrieval of raw data were done according to the VITEK instrument user manual. Test results 
were recorded within 10 h of incubation.
Phenotypic fingerprints were generated through GNIII MicroPlate according to BioLog’s protocol. Briefly, 
freshly grown colonies were transferred aseptically into the inoculum solution A (Cat #. 72401; BioLog) to 
prepare homogenous suspension with a density equivalent to a McFarland No. 0.50. Inoculum was loaded 
onto BioLog GNIII MicroPlate (100 µl per well) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. OmniLog values (A590-A750) 
were recorded after a minimum 10 h of incubation using MicroPlate reader (FLUO star Omega, BMG Labtech, 
Germany).
Chemotaxonomy
To analyze the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), cells were grown on TSA at 30 °C for 48 h until they reached 
mid-exponential growth phase. The harvested cell biomass was subjected to saponification, methylation, and 
­extraction28 for fatty acid analysis, which was carried out using the Microbial Identification System (MIDI)29 with 
the Aerobe (RTSBA6) database (Sherlock version 6.0) following the standard ­protocol30. A gas chromatograph 
(Agilent 7890A) with a flame ionization detector was used for FAME analysis, and identification and comparison 
of the results were made using the MIDI System.
To extract and analyze quinones, polar lipids and peptidoglycans, cells were cultivated on TSA for 3 days at 
30 °C. The polar lipids and quinones were extracted and analyzed by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatog-
raphy (2D-TLC)31. To visualize the different classes of polar lipids, the developed TLC plates were treated with 
10% (w/v) ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid for total lipids, 0.2% (w/v) ninhydrin in butanol for aminolipids

(specific for amino groups), Dittmer and Lester’s Zinzadze reagent for phospholipids (specific for phosphates), 
and α-naphthol for glycolipids (specific for sugars). Peptidoglycans were extracted and analyzed for the diagnostic 
amino acids from whole ­cells32.
DNA extraction and whole genome sequencing
To extract genomic DNA from the novel species, the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit was utilized, follow-
ing the manufacturer’s instructions. To prepare the library for WGS, an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library 
preparation kit was used as described ­earlier10. Sequencing of prepared libraries was carried out on a NovaSeq 
6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform. The read qualities were evaluated using FastQC v.0.11.733, and 
subsequenly quality filtered, trimmed and cleared of adapter sequences using fastp v0.2034. Draft genomes were 
assembled using SPAdes v.3.11.135 up to the scaffold level, and the assembly quality was evaluated using QUAST 
v.5.0.236. The default settings were employed for all steps except for fastp, which included 512 adapters screening.
In addition to Illumina WGS, a secondary round of sequencing was carried out for strains IIF3SC-B10T and 
­F6_8S_P_1BT using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Additionally, Sporosarcina thermotolerans CCUG ­53480 T, 
kindly provided by Dr. Edward Moore from the Culture Collection University of Gothenburg (CCUG), Sweden, 
also underwent WGS with the use of Nanopore MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Nanop-
ore sequencing libraries were prepared using the SQK-RBK114.24 rapid chemistry-based barcoding kit (Oxford 
Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Long read sequencing was conducted using an R.10.4.1 flow cell. Base 
calling was performed via MinKnow/Guppy. Adapters were trimmed using Porechop (v.0.2.4)37 and reads were 
filtered using filtlong v.0.2.1, with parameters –min_length 1000 –keep_percent 90. For strains IIF3SC-B10T and 
­F6_8S_P_1BT, a hybrid genome assembly was generated using Unicycler (v.0.5.0)38. For strain CCUG ­53480T a 
long-read only assembly was generated using the same tool with default settings. Genome assembly quality was 
assessed using QUAST (v.5.2.0)36.
ANI and dDDH analyses
To elucidate species affiliation of the isolated genomes, we retrieved all validly described and representative 
genomes of four identified genera from the NCBI database using the command-line tool ‘bit’39. We calculated 
the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to perform pairwise 
nucleotide-level comparisons. For ANI calculations, we employed FastANI v.1.33, which is a rapid alignment-
free computational method, with the novel species as a query against other genomes. To estimate the in-silico 
DNA–DNA hybridization, we used the recommended formula 2 of the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator 
(GGDC) v.3.0 with the BLAST + alignment ­tool40. To further evaluate the genetic relatedness of the genomes of 
the genera Sporosarcina, ANI based analysis was used. All available genomes on the NCBI GenBank database 
under the genera Sporosarcina (n = 93) were retrieved using ncbi-genome-download (v.0.3.1). An all-vs-all ANI 
analysis of the genomes was conducted and drawn using ANIclustermap (v.1.2.0).
Phylogenetic analysis
The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the novel species were extracted from their WGS. Phylogenetic trees were con-
structed for each genus by incorporating publicly available 16S sequences of all the species within the respective 
genus. In cases where only the WGS was publicly available, a blast wrapper script was employed to extract the 
16S sequence. The trees were rooted using a related species within the same family. The DECIPHER package 
was used to align and trim the 16S ­sequences41. To build phylogenetic trees, the phangorn package was ­used42 on 
maximum likelihood with AIC values and 1,000 bootstrap ­replicates42. The trees were visualized using Interac-
tive Tree of Life (iTOL)43.
We created a whole genome-based phylogenies to identify closely related species of the isolated genomes. 
We used GToTree v.1.7.0744, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based command-line tool which aligns identified 
single copy genes using Muscle v.3.8 and produces concatenated protein alignment. For the Arthrobacter and 
Leifsonia genomes, we used 138 single-copy gene (SCG) sets of Actinobacteria, while for the Paenibacillus and 
Sporosarcina genomes, we used 119 SCG sets of Firmicutes. IQTREE v.2.2.0.3 with ModelFinder-Plus was then 
used to construct the phylogenetic tree from the protein alignment with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap ­replicates45–47. 
We further retrieved 4,552 complete, non-anomalous, representative genomes of bacteria from NCBI Reference 
Sequence (RefSeq) database and constructed a phylogenetic tree of life along with the novel species using 16 
SCG-set as previously ­described48 (data not shown). Genomes containing at least 40% of the total 16 SGC targets 
were placed in the phylogenetic tree. All the trees were further annotated and visualized using interactive Tree 
Of Life (iTOL) v.6.749.
Mapping metagenome sequence reads from ISS to isolated novel species
To investigate the presence of the isolated novel species in environmental samples from ISS, we retrieved paired-
end metagenomics reads from two microbial tracking (MT) missions, MT-1 (n = 42) and MT-2 (n = 64), from 
the NCBI Short Read Archive with project accession ­PRJNA4385454 and ­PRJNA7812778, respectively. Quality 
filtering of the metagenomes was performed using Trimmomatic v.0.39 with a sliding window of 4 bases and an 
average quality per base cutoff of ­2050. We used MetaCompass v.2.051 to perform reference-guided assembly of 
the aligned metagenome reads against isolated genomes of novel species. We quantified the number of reads that 
aligned to the isolated genomes and assessed the breadth of the coverage of the assembled reads in each sample. 
We further tried to bin the contigs using MetaBAT v.2.12.1, but were unable to resolve any MAGs.

Genome annotation and prediction of secondary‑metabolite biosynthetic potential
The gene prediction and annotation of the novel genomes were performed using the Rapid Annotations based on 
Subsystem Technology (RAST) online server using RAST-tk annotation ­scheme52. The Resistance Gene Identifier 
(RGI) v6.0.1 web portal which utilizes the CARD v3.2.6 database was used to identify antibiotic resistance genes 
and markers in the novel species from ISS environments with only “Perfect” and “Strict” matches. Secondary 
metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were identified within each novel genomes using antiSMASH v.7.0.0 
with a “strict” detection ­system53. The identified BGCs were curated for functional annotation using MIBiG v.3.1 
JSON file via an in-house Python ­script54.
Results
The six strains isolated during this study belonged to five novel species spanning four bacterial genera. Among 
the six strains, four were non-spore-forming members and two strains formed endospores. Based on 16S rRNA 
gene similarities, not all strains were identified into a novel bacterial species, but ANI/dDDH analyses allowed 
them to be placed into five distinct bacterial species. They were: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, Leifsonia 
virtsii ­F6_8S_P_1AT, Leifsonia williamsii ­F6_8S_P_1BT, Paenibacillus vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT, and Sporosarcina 
highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T. In addition, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG ­53480T was generated and compared 
with the genome of S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits.
Genome characteristics and relatedness indices
Table 1 summarizes the assembly statistics for all six strains. The draft genomes of the novel bacterial species 
were assembled using high-quality sequences, and their assembly quality varied from a single contig to 49 scaf-
folds. The non-spore-forming strains had high GC contents, ranging from 68% to 71.4%, whereas spore-forming 
strains, such as P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT (46.1%) and S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T (41.6%), had low GC con-
tent. The total number of predicted genes was 2166 for S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T and 4861 for P. vandeheii 
­F6_3S_P_1CT. However, the non-spore-forming bacterial species had ~ 3444 to 3850 coding regions (Table 1). 
In addition to the novel species, the complete genome of S. thermotolerans CCUG ­53480T was generated and 
compared to S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T strain since both shared > 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities.
Table 2 presents the similarities among closely related members of the novel species based on ANI, dDDH, 
and two marker genes (16S rRNA and gyrB). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all five novel species described in 
this study exhibited > 99% similarities to previously established species. However, the gyrB gene sequence simi-
larities of the novel species with the closely related species ranged from 88.6 to 92.8% and could serve as a genetic

marker to distinguish the novel species. Moreover, ANI indices (< 95%) and dDDH values (< 70%) fell below 
the threshold levels of bacterial species identity and confirmed that the examined ISS strains were novel species.
Phylogeny
The comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, isolated from the air particles col-
lected from ARED during Flight 2, revealed a high similarity (> 99.6%) to most established Arthrobacter species. 
This suggests that the 16S rRNA gene may not be an adequate marker for distinguishing members within this 
genus. However, upon analyzing the gyrB gene sequences of this phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were 
found to be below 85.9%. Furthermore, strain IIF3SC-B10T displayed low values for digital dDDH (24.5%) and 
ANI indices (82.9%). These findings provide additional evidence supporting its classification as a novel species.
In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree encompassing all Arthrobacter species (Fig. 1A), with Micrococcus 
antarcticus as the outgroup, strain IIF3SC-B10T clustered together with officially named species such as A. agilis, 
A. cheniae, A. bussei, and A. antioxidans (Fig. 1A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 1B), constructed using a 
concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 59 genomes containing 138 single-copy core genes common to all 
Actinobacteria, A. burdickii was found to be distinct from the A. ruber and A. cheniae clades. Instead, it exhibited 
closer similarity to the unrecognized species A. sedimenti (ANI 93.8%).
The 16S rRNA gene sequences of L. virtsii ­F6_8S_P_1AT, isolated from crew quarters in Flight 6, exhib-
ited > 98.9% similarity to L. soli and L. shinshuensis, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker 
for distinguishing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences of the members of this 
phylogenetic clade, the similarity values were below 91.7%. However, the strain ­F6_8S_P_1AT exhibited low 
dDDH values (< 28.3%) and ANI indices (86.3%), providing further evidence that it belongs to a novel species. 
In the 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic tree of all Leifsonia species, with Rathayibacter tritici as the outgroup, strain 
­F6_8S_P_1AT was placed within a clade that also included the validly described species L. aquatica, L. xyli, L. 
lichenia, L. shinshuensis, and L. soli (Fig. 2A). However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B), which was constructed 
using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters of eight available genomes containing a total of 138 single-copy 
core genes common to all species in the Actinobacteria, L. virtsii was separated from all these Leifsonia species. 
The next closest member was L. soli (ANI 86.3%).
In addition to L. virtsii, two strains were identified as L. williamsii based on their gyrB sequence similarity 
(91.6%), ANI index (84.3%), and dDDH value (24.7%), which were below the species threshold level. Surpris-
ingly, despite the high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between L. virtsii and L. williamsii (99.2%), the 16S 
rRNA gene tree (Fig. 2A) placed them in different clades, supported by 88% bootstrap values. Notably, the L. 
williamsii strains were isolated from the same crew quarter location as L. virtsii, and they even originated from 
the same culture plate of R2A medium. Initially, there was a suspicion that they might be clones from the same

colony, but further analysis using WGS and gyrB sequencing confirmed that they were distinct novel species. 
In contrast to the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, the WGS-based tree (Fig. 2B) clearly differentiated L. williamsii 
from L. virtsii.
The 16S rRNA gene sequences of P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT, isolated from the ARED’s surface during Flight 6, 
exhibited 99.5% similarity to P. pabuli, indicating that the 16S rRNA gene is not a suitable marker for distinguish-
ing members of this genus. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, P. pabuli also exhibited 94.9% similarity 
with P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT. Since it was established that ~ 95% gyrB as cut-off value for species delineation, 
WGS was performed which showed that ANI index was only 88.4%. Based on low ANI index and dDDH value 
(34.6%), P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT is differentiated from P. pabuli and described as a novel species. The 16S 
rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 3A) showed that P. xylanivrans, P. taichungensis, and P. paubli formed a tight 
clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 3B), which was constructed 
using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 244 genomes containing a total of 119 single-copy core 
genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, P. vandeheii was separated from all these Paenibacillus species 
and was found to be closer to the P. xylanivorans (ANI 92.8%).
The strain ­F6_3S_P_2T, another spore-forming bacterium belonging to the genus Sporosarcina and isolated 
from the ARED surface during Flight 6, displayed a 99.8% similarity to S. thermotolerans based on the 16S rRNA 
gene. This finding highlights the difficulty in classifying spore-forming microorganisms using the 16S rRNA gene 
marker. Hence, the WGS of S. thermotolerans CCUG ­53480T was needed to identify the phylogenetic position of 
S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T. Upon comparing the gyrB gene sequences, S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T exhibited 
an 87.0% similarity with S. thermotolerans CCUG ­53480T. Furthermore, the ANI index between the genomes of 
­F6_3S_P_2T and S. thermotolerans CCUG ­53480T was only 85.3%. Considering the low ANI index and dDDH 
value (29.8%), S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T can be identified as a novel species, distinct from S. thermotolerans. 
In the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny (Fig. 4A), S. thermotolerans, S. luteola, and S. saromensis formed a closely 
related clade with > 99% similarities among them. However, S. koreensis did not cluster within this clade, despite 
having a 16S rRNA gene similarity with S. highlanderae. On the other hand, in the WGS-based tree (Fig. 4B), 
constructed using a concatenated alignment of gene clusters from 15 genomes containing 119 single-copy core 
genes common to all species in the Firmicutes, S. highlanderae was separated from all other Sporosarcina species. 
Instead, it exhibited closer similarity to S. thermotolerans (ANI 85.3%).
Phenotypic characterization
The cell size (Fig. 5), colony morphology, biochemical characteristics based on Vitek-2 (Supplemental Table S1) 
and BioLog GNIII (Supplemental Table S2), fatty acid profiles (Supplemental Table S3) and chemotaxonomic 
features (Supplemental Figure S1) of all five novel species are presented. A. burdickii can be phenotypically dif-
ferentiated from other closely related Arthrobacter species since maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, turanose, and ace-
toacetic acid were not utilized as sole carbon substrate (Table 3). The Leifsonia species did not show any specific

phenotypic characteristics that could be used to differentiate them from other closely related Leifsonia species; 
hence, molecular phylogeny is essential (Table 4). P. vandeheii was able to grow at 8% NaCl which can be used 
as discriminative test. Oxidase test was also positive whereas P. tundrae, P. xylanexedens, and P. amylolitus were 
negative. In addition, P. vandeheii can be differentiated by the utilization of Tween 40, turanose, γ-hydroxybutyric 
acid, l-malic acid, and l-serine as sole carbon source from P. taichungensis and P. paubli which are negative 
(Table 5). S. highlanderae could grow at 4% NaCl only, but S. thermotolerans, S. luteola, and S. saromensis were 
able to withstand > 7.5% to 10% NaCl concentration (Table 6).
Chemotaxonomic characterization
The novel actinobacterial species, namely A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, L. virtsii ­F6_8S_P_1AT and L. williamsii 
­F6_8S_P_1BT, were found to contain diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified glycolipid 
as their major polar lipids. Additionally, A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significant amount 
of an unidentified phospholipid (PL1), a characteristic that sets it apart from Leifsonia species. P. vandeheii 
­F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited a complex polar lipid profile, which included phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidyl-
glycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, two unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified 
aminophospholipid. On the other hand, S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T was found to contain phosphatidylglycerol, 
diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine two unidentified phospholipids and an identified lipid. The 
polar lipid profiles of new species are in excellent agreement with the data published earlier for Arthrobacter55, 
Leifsonia56, Paenibacillus57,58, and Sporosarcina59.
Based on this polyphasic taxonomy, the five novel species are described, and their detailed phenotypic, FAME 
profile, chemotaxonomic, and molecular characteristics are given below.

Leifsonia williamsii sp. nov.
Leifsonia williamsii (wil.li.ams’i.i. N.L. gen. n. williamsii, named in honor of a NASA astronaut; Jeffrey Williams).
Colonies are circular, convex, smooth, yellow and 1.0–1.5 mm in diameter on TSA medium after 72 h at 25 °C. 
Cells are aerobic, Gram-stain-positive, motile, rods, 0.2–0.3 µm in width and 0.8–1.7 µm in length. Tolerates 
up to 5% NaCl. Grows at 4–45 °C, with optimum growth at 25 °C, and at pH 5.2–9.0. Positive for oxidase and

Abundance of novel species in ISS metagenomes
We conducted an analysis of metagenomic reads obtained from two microbial tracking (MT) missions, encom-
passing seven flights across eight locations on the ISS, with the objective of identifying novel microbial species 
and potentially retrieving MAGs. To assess the presence of viable and intact cells of the novel species, we utilized 
propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment on the samples as previously ­described7,8. Our findings revealed that 
the majority of the metagenomes had less than 0.1% of their total reads mapped to the novel species. Among 
all the species analyzed, P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest mapping, with a maximum of 1.05% 
of total reads from a sample collected during Flight 2 near the port crew quarters (location 8) during MT-1. 
Therefore, we can conclude that none of these novel species are dominant in the ISS. Considering the limited 
proportion of reads mapped to the novel species, we proceeded to perform read assembly to explore the breadth 
of coverage against the isolated genomes. Interestingly, reads mapped to L. virtsii ­F6_8S_P_1AT and L. williamsii 
­F6_8S_P_1BT from Flight 6 at location 8 exhibited a breadth of coverage of 59.4% and 80.7% respectively, despite 
representing a small fraction of the total reads (Fig. 6). However, apart from these cases, the overall breadth of 
coverage for the genomes was quite low, averaging at 0.21% hence, no MAG was generated. We also analyzed 
the PMA untreated samples and observed the similar pattern in the distribution of the breadth of coverages. 
Additionally, we noticed 84.4% breadth of coverage for L. williamsii ­F6_8S_P_1BT during Flight 7 at location 
8 from where the strain was isolated. Despite the presence of a high breadth of coverage for Leifsonia genomes 
across multiple samples, we were unable to obtain MAGs due to the failure of achieving the minimum coverage 
depth threshold of 4X.
Functional characterization of the novel species
To investigate the genetic characteristics of the six novel strains, we performed a comprehensive genome annota-
tion using RAST-tk (Table 7; Supplemental Table S4). The subsystem mapping results are as follows: A. burdickii 
IIF3SC-B10T (283 subsystems), L. virtsii ­F6_8S_P_1AT (273 subsystems), L. williamsii ­F6_8S_P_1BT (262 sub-
systems), L. williamsii ­F6_8S_P_1CT (262 subsystems), P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT (324 subsystems), and S.

highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T (307 subsystems). Among the annotated subsystems, the top categories based on 
average gene counts included amino acids and derivatives (260 genes), carbohydrate metabolism (232 genes), 
cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (136 genes), and protein metabolism (171 genes).
Further analysis of these organisms from the ISS revealed that, on average, they possess 46 genes related 
to virulence, disease, and defense. Two mechanisms were predicted as the primarily function of these genes: 
resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and invasion and intracellular resistance. A. burdickii IIF3SC-
B10T, in particular, is the only species that harbors the sarcosine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.1) gene, which is involved 
in the osmotic stress response. On the other hand, P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T, 
both belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, possess a specific mechanism to respond to bacitracin-induced stress 
through the bceABRS four-component system. Notably, these two species also possess additional stress response 
mechanisms for periplasmic stress via the intramembrane protease RasP/YluC. While exploring other factors, 
it was observed that A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T does not possess any genes associated with motility. However, the 
other novel species have genes related to motility, including flagellar biosynthesis proteins. Among all the species, 
only P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT has the chemotaxis subsystem.
We conducted further investigations into the metabolic potential of these novel species and made some 
noteworthy observations. A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T was found to possess a significantly higher number of genes 
related to aromatic compound metabolism, while having fewer genes associated with iron metabolism com-
pared to the other species characterized in this study. With the exception of P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT, all the 
other species exhibited the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, only P. vandeheii 
­F6_3S_P_1CT, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2), can utilize glutathione as a 
sulfur source.
Considering the concerns regarding spore-forming bacteria and their resistance to sterilization processes 
in the ISS, we further explored the spore-forming capabilities of these novel species. As expected, a significant 
number of genes associated with dormancy and sporulation were predicted in P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT and 
S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T genomes. Between them, P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT exhibited the highest number 
of 40 genes, primarily associated with spore germination and spore maturation processes. In contrast, the other 
species are non-spore forming and do not possess specific proteins associated with sporulation.
Figure 6.   Box plots showing breadth of coverage of the consensus genome constructed from mapped reads 
aligned to the novel species (percent coverage was less than 1% in all cases). Due to high variations in the 
breadth of coverages of Leifsonia genomes, a broken Y-axis was used. The reads were collected from eight 
locations on the ISS across seven separate time points/flights as part of the Microbial Tracking project(s).

Antimicrobial resistance properties of the novel species
In the isolated five novel species, we searched for antibiotic resistance genes against the CARD ­database60 and 
calculated the percentage identity with the reference sequences. Overall, these genomes showed potential resist-
ance to seven drug classes, including rifamycin and tetracycline antibiotics. Interestingly, we found that all of 
these genomes contained genes from vancomycin resistance gene clusters with an identity ranging from 30.7% 
to 51.5%. Among other identified resistance genes, we discovered the presence of rifampicin monooxygenase 
(RIFMO) in Leifsonia species with a 63% match, which catalyzes the inactivation of the antibiotic rifampicin.
In P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT, we identified a set of markers, including Llm 23S ribosomal RNA methyltrans-
ferase (LlmA_23S_CLI) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which exhibited high sequence identities 
of 84.67% and 87.91%, respectively. LlmA_23S_CLI was originally detected in Paenibacillus sp. LC231, a strain 
isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, NM, ­USA61. Additionally, strain ­F6_3S_P_1CT was found to possess two genes,

qacG and qacJ, which are part of a small multidrug resistance efflux pump conferring resistance to quaternary 
ammonium compounds (QACs).
Furthermore, in P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT and S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T, we identified the presence of 
tetracycline-resistant ribosomal protection genes tetB(P) and tet(Q), respectively, with approximately 30% simi-
larity. These provide resistance by preventing the binding of the antibiotic tetracycline to the bacterial ribo-
some. Moreover, these genomes also encode orthologues of the antibiotic-inactivating enzyme fosfomycin thiol 
transferase. The genomic mining predicted the presence of AMR genes but the confirmation of the phenotypic 
resistance requires further investigation.
Production of secondary metabolites
To explore the potential for producing secondary metabolites in the newly discovered species, we utilized ant-
iSMASH, a bioinformatics tool for predicting putative BGCs. This analysis revealed a total of 16 cluster types, 
including βlactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters (Table 8). In A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, 
we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161, known for its effectiveness against 
multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and ­fungi62. Furthermore, in the isolated Leifsonia species, we 
found two well-known gene clusters: T3PKS-alkylresorcinol and NAPAA (non-α poly-amino acids) ε-Poly-l-
lysine (ε-PL), both with a 100% match. Among the analyzed species, Leifsonia species shared a partially matched 
carotenoid BGC with P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT. However, several unique cluster types, including cyclic-lactone-
autoinducer, lanthipeptide, lassopeptide, NRP-metallophore, opine-like-metallophore, and proteusin, were iden-
tified exclusively in P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT. Notably, within the ­F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we also identified BGCs 
paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%). Lastly, S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T exhibited one phosphonate, one 
T3PKS, and one terpene BGC, although these clusters have not yet been fully characterized.
Discussion
New launch technology and new investment in human exploration of space by governments and private indus-
try are leading to a revitalization of the idea of long-term space habitation. Missions to the moon are already 
underway, and missions to Mars are planned for the near future. Such missions will be measured in multiple 
years rather than in months and will have no or little resupply from Earth. In such cases, the microbiome of

the space vessel or habitat will need to be monitored for multiple reasons: the spread of pathogens through 
the air or on surfaces which could infect ­humans63 or ­plants64 as well as the spread of antimicrobial resistance 
­genes65, the health of human commensal microbiomes (and potential overgrowth of secondary pathogens), and 
the potential for biofouling of fluid lines or water supplies via microbial ­overgrowth66. Also, with no resupply 
from Earth there is no ability to gain access to Earth’s massive microbial biodiversity. Unless specific microbes 
are stocked as supplies before ­launch1, the microbes found on the spacecraft or habitat are the only ones which 
could be used for the many commercial purposes that microbes are used for on Earth: antibiotic or therapeutic 
discovery, manufacturing of drugs, food, and vitamins, plant growth enhancement, probiotics, etc. Biological 
in-situ resource utilization may also require bioremediation or bioconversion of raw, potentially toxic materials 
collected from moons, other planets, or asteroids/comets.
Whether or not the microbiome of a space habitat can be controlled and repurposed to this extent depends 
on a number of factors, including (1) whether the microbial diversity of such a space habitat would be sufficient 
to include all the traits desired for the many purposes listed above, (2) accurate detection and identification 
of already-known microbes and taxonomic placement of unidentified microbes, including whether shotgun 
metagenomic sequencing would detect the presence of problematic microbes from low biomass surfaces, and (3) 
characterization of potential phenotypic traits based on genomic predictions. Like the proverbial mustard seed, 
perhaps we inadvertently carry a planet’s worth of microbial diversity wherever we travel. The novel microbes 
described herein are not necessarily any more noteworthy than those which might be isolated from an office 
building on Earth [though they are likely far more resilient given the harsh ­conditions67 of the space environ-
ment], and yet each hosts significant potential for affecting human ­health5 or for use in assisting plant ­growth68, 
bioremediation or manufacturing, and offers a glimpse into the genetic and metabolic potential of the microbial 
diversity of the ­ISS69.
The most abundant cultivable microbes on ISS surfaces include common, well-studied human commensals 
such as Staphylococcus, Rhodotorula, Penicillium, and Micrococcus species. However, there are many more that 
have only been isolated once aboard the ISS and which are at very low abundance—potentially shed from indi-
vidual astronauts, from experiments such as plant grow-ins, from new pieces of cargo, or from the vast microbial 
diversity of the human gut—which can be considered a part of the rare microbiome. Although individually rare, 
members of this community collectively play significant roles in ecosystem functioning and stability, including 
functional redundancy which enhances the resilience and stability of ecosystems by ensuring that multiple micro-
bial species can perform essential ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and symbiotic 
interactions. The novel bacterial species described during this study belong to rare microbial species since their 
incidence in the shotgun metagenomes was very low, and only the two Leifsonia species had sufficiently high 
breadth of coverage of mapped metagenomic reads from the ISS crew quarters to have been definitively identified 
using shotgun metagenomic sequencing without culturing as well.
Previous to using a WGS approach, the diversity of the ISS cultivable microbiome was significantly under-
estimated due to reliance on only 16S-based taxonomic identification. However, for many bacterial genera, 
16S rRNA gene sequencing strategy fails to differentiate new species with significantly different phenotypic 
traits. For instance, there is 99.8% similarity between the 16S rRNA genes of S. highlanderae ­F6_3S_P_2T and 
S. thermotolerans CCUG ­53480T, with a mere 3 base pair substitutions. Without access to the whole genome, S. 
highlanderae would be categorized as S. thermotolerans, even though it is not a thermophile. Upon accessing all 
93 Sporosarcina genomes from the NCBI database and generating an ANI heatmap (Supplemental Figure S2), it 
was evident that this clade contains at least five novel genera and 56 species which are yet to be described. This 
inference was based on ANI values of less than 70% for 14 Sporosarcina genomes, encompassing S. highlanderae, 
S. thermotolerans, and S. luteola and further emphasizes that the 16S rRNA gene on its own is not a reliable tool 
for differentiating among members of the Sporosarcina genus. Placing these 93 genomes into their phylogenetic 
affiliation require more study.
Upon examining 337 ISS bacterial genomes (plus six novel strains) belonging to 36 bacterial species (plus 
five novel species), it was observed that non-dominant, rare, and phylogenetically undescribed species predicted 
to produce natural products. As their genetic and phenotypic potential remains uncharacterized, exploration of 
the rare microbiome can lead to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds, enzymes, and metabolic pathways. 
Many of these rare microorganisms have untapped biotechnological potential, with applications in fields such 
as medicine, agriculture, industry, and environmental remediation. Studying the rare microbiome can uncover 
valuable resources for the development of new biotechnological tools and processes.
In the case of A. burdickii IIF3SC-B10T, we identified a moderately matched thiopeptide antibiotic called 
TP-1161, known for its efficacy against multidrug-resistant Gram-stain-positive bacteria and ­fungi62. Leifso-
nia species contain alkylresorcinol, which exhibits various activities including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, 
antimicrobial, antioxidant, and genotoxicity ­effects70. Additionally, alkylresorcinol plays a role in bacterial cyst 
formation during unfavorable environmental ­conditions71. On the other hand, ε-PL is responsible for antimi-
crobial activity against food spoilage and food-poisoning ­bacteria72.
In addition, A. burdickii and P. vandeheii also harbor metal-dependent β-lactamase superfamily-I and III 
proteins, which are known for their involvement in the hydrolysis of β-lactam ­antibiotics73. This enzyme family 
plays a significant role in conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins. 
Furthermore, multidrug resistance efflux pumps such as the acriflavine resistance protein and Multidrug And 
Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) family of Multidrug Resistance (MDR) efflux pumps were found to be 
present in Leifsonia species and spore-formers. These efflux pumps contribute to bacterial resistance by actively 
pumping out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds from the cell, including antibiotics and toxic compounds, 
thereby reducing their intracellular concentrations and promoting bacterial survival. The acriflavin resistance 
protein (AcrA) is a crucial component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, which confers resistance to acriflavin 
and other antimicrobial compounds. Its role in antibiotic resistance, multidrug efflux, intracellular homeostasis,

biofilm formation, and potentially bacterial virulence underscores its significance in bacterial survival and adap-
tation. Understanding AcrA’s function may aid in the development of strategies to combat antibiotic resistance 
and improve therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Given its involvement in 
antibiotic resistance and multidrug efflux, AcrA has emerged as a potential target for the development of novel 
antimicrobial ­agents74. By inhibiting the function of AcrA or other components of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, 
it may be possible to overcome bacterial resistance and enhance the effectiveness of existing antibiotics.
Identification of fosfomycin resistance protein (fosB) in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes in 
this study is crucial for effective infection control measures and the development of strategies to combat the 
spread of antibiotic resistance. It has been reported that fosB is significant due to its impact on the treatment of 
bacterial infections, the emergence of multidrug resistance, the potential for horizontal gene transfer, and its 
implications for public ­health75.
Streptothricin acetyltransferase was present in both Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina genomes and it was 
reported that streptothricin is a valuable antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against microorganisms and 
can help reduce crop losses and increase agricultural ­productivity76. Its significance extends beyond its direct 
antimicrobial properties, finding applications in research, agriculture, and drug development. Understanding 
streptothricin’s mode of action and resistance mechanisms contributes to our knowledge of antibiotics and aids 
in the development of novel strategies to combat bacterial infections. Streptothricin has shown efficacy in agri-
cultural practices, particularly in plant and fungal disease ­management76.
The ribosome protection-type tetracycline resistance-related proteins, group 2, are crucial determinants of 
resistance to tetracycline antibiotics in both Gram-stain-negative and positive ­microbes77. Their ability to protect 
ribosomes from the inhibitory effects of tetracycline enables microbial survival and growth in the presence of 
the antibiotic. The presence of these proteins in spore-forming novel species during this study and not in non-
spore-forming bacteria needs further research.
Choloylglycine hydrolase plays a critical role in bile acid metabolism, enterohepatic circulation, and the 
regulation of the bile acid ­pool78 and predicted only in the S. highlanderae genome. Its activity influences the 
composition and function of the gut microbiota and has implications for host health and ­disease79. Understanding 
the significance of this enzyme provides insights into bile acid metabolism ­disorders80 and potential therapeutic 
approaches for related conditions.
Multiple genes for bioremediation of toxic material, enhanced plant growth, and survival in extreme condi-
tions are predicted in the genomes of these novel species. Except for P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT, all the other 
species possess the capability to perform polyhydroxybutyrate metabolism. However, P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT 
stands out as it can utilize glutathione as a sulfur source, due to the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 
(EC 2.3.2.2)81.
Within the P. vandeheii ­F6_3S_P_1CT strain, we identified paeninodin (60%) and bacillopaline (100%), which 
were originally characterized in Paenibacillus dendritiformis ­C45482 and Paenibacillus mucilaginosus ­KNP41483, 
respectively. Furthermore, this strain harbors a siderophore gene cluster (100%) responsible for producing the 
antimycobacterial agent ­bacillibactin84. The siderophore cluster also facilitates the conversion of iron from Fe3+ 
to Fe2+, which is a more usable form for the microbe and its plant host under iron-limited conditions. Sidero-
phore synthesis gene clusters are rare in Paenibacillus species and are believed to have been acquired through 
horizontal gene transfer ­events85.
Genome mining resulted in identifying key functional genes of the novel species described in this study are 
listed in Table 7. Among all the novel species, mining of A. burdickii genome shows metal-dependent hydrolases 
of the β-lactamase superfamily III (MBL-III) enzyme. The MBL-III enzymes have shown potential in bioremedia-
tion processes aimed at the degradation of environmental ­pollutants86. The ability of MBL-III enzymes to degrade 
diverse chemical compounds, including pesticides, herbicides, and aromatic compounds, makes them valuable 
tools in the cleanup of contaminated ­environments87. These MBL-III enzymes can contribute to the removal and 
detoxification of pollutants, reducing their impact on ecosystems. Similarly, only in the genome of A. burdickii, 
DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator is predicted as shown in Arthrobacter sp. H-02-388 which plays 
a crucial role in cellular responses to heavy metal exposure, including detoxification, metal homeostasis, stress 
response, and environmental adaptation.
In the genome of L. virtsii, organomercurial lyase is predicted which is reported to play a crucial role in the 
detoxification of organomercurial compounds, contributing to the protection of organisms and ecosystems by 
­actinobacteria88. Its significance lies in the detoxification of toxic organomercurials, environmental protection, 
potential applications in bioremediation, insights into enzyme mechanisms, and biotechnological applications. 
Understanding and harnessing the capabilities of organomercurial lyase can aid in addressing mercury pollution 
and developing sustainable solutions for environmental and human health ­challenges88.
The magnesium and cobalt efflux protein (CorC) plays a significant role in maintaining metal ion homeo-
stasis, protecting against metal toxicity, facilitating adaptation to metal-rich environments, and contributing to 
bacterial stress response. Its activity is important for cellular functions and can also impact antibiotic resistance. 
The identification of CorC in only three Leifsonia genomes during this study, while not observed in other novel 
species, holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms employed by actino-
bacterial group to regulate metal ions and adapt to diverse environmental conditions.
In summary, the rare microbiome is instrumental in maintaining ecosystem stability, adapting to environmen-
tal changes, facilitating ecological interactions, spurring biotechnological innovation, and bolstering conservation 
efforts. Investigations into, and preservation of, the rare microbiome enhance our understanding of microbial 
diversity and ecosystem dynamics, thereby contributing to the sustainable management of the ecosystems. Con-
servation strategies should consider the preservation of rare microorganisms, as their loss could precipitate 
cascading effects on ecosystem functioning and resilience. Our study of novel microbes and predicted bioactive 
compounds contributes to our understanding of the microbial ecosystem on the ISS and lays the groundwork

for further investigation into the potential implications of these novel species for the health and well-being of 
the ISS crew, as well as future space missions. The presence of specific genes and proteins in these novel species 
underscores their adaptive capabilities and potential resistance mechanisms against a variety of environmental 
challenges, including exposure to antibiotics. A deeper understanding of the genetic composition and functional 
capabilities of these novel species provides valuable insights into their survival strategies and could contribute to 
the development of improved antimicrobial therapies and strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.
