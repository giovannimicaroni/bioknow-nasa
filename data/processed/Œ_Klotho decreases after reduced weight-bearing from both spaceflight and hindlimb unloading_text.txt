Alpha(α)Klotho, a soluble transmembrane protein, facilitates calcium-phosphorus homeostasis through feedback between bone
and kidney and is a potential systemic biomarker for bone-kidney health during spaceﬂight. We determined if: (1) plasma αKlotho
was reduced after both spaceﬂight aboard the ISS and hindlimb unloading (HU); and (2) deﬁciency could be reversed with exercise.
Both spaceﬂight and HU lowered circulating plasma αKlotho: plasma αKlotho recovered with exercise after HU.

INTRODUCTION
Atrophy of skeletal elements has long been identiﬁed as a hazard
for the success of long-duration missions and astronaut quality of
life1. US astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS)
exhibit loss of bone density when comparing pre- and post-ﬂight
DXA scan measurements2,3. Bone density reduction for a Mars
mission has been estimated of up to 36%4. Recovery from bone
degradation appears to be incomplete5,6.
The role of the kidneys in skeletal homeostasis is complex.
Recent research interest includes the interplay between αKlotho
and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23)7. Alpha Klotho is secreted
predominantly in the kidneys, whereas FGF23 is secreted by
osteocytes8.
FGF23
binds
to
αKlotho,
and
increases
urine
phosphorous excretion9. Both are required, as seen in mice that
demonstrate phosphate retention if either component is deﬁ-
cient10. FGF23 also increases calcium reabsorption7. Through
these mechanisms, FGF23 eliminates excess phosphorus and
increases plasma calcium, with subsequent decreased calcitriol
synthesis and parathyroid hormone (PTH) release. In non-weight-
bearing climates with known bone density loss, αKlotho and
FGF23 may play a role in skeletal homeostasis.
The current spaceﬂight countermeasures aimed at preventing
bone loss provide incomplete protection6,11. The Advanced
Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) is utilized for exercise aboard
the ISS12. Use of the ARED as a single countermeasure largely
maintains preﬂight skeletal health over a 6-month mission in
orbit11, but bone loss is observed by 1 year post-ﬂight, indicating
progressive atrophy despite a return to full weight-bearing and
from astronauts also receiving bisphosphonate therapy11. Addi-
tionally, a device as large and complex as ARED is likely not
feasible on an exploration class mission due to limitations in mass
and habitable space. These ﬁndings add concerns for the current
ability to preserve bone health outside low earth orbit.
Currently, no reliable real-time analysis of biomarkers or skeletal
imaging
on
orbit
exists.
Identiﬁcation
of
novel
circulating
biomarkers for musculoskeletal health, such as αKlotho, could
prove crucial to protective measures as the space community
turns its eyes towards Mars.
This pilot investigation measured circulating αKlotho levels in
mice after exposure to two reduced weight-bearing conditions:
microgravity aboard the ISS, and after hind limb unloading (HU)13.
Importantly, musculoskeletal degradation has previously been
described in hindlimbs from these same mice after 35 days in
microgravity and HU14,15, observing recovery of joint health upon
return to full weight-bearing with exercise15. Likewise, this study
examined if deﬁcits in circulating αKlotho after periods HU could be
recovered after return to full-weight bearing, with/without perform-
ing exercise. Changes in α-Klotho after acute bouts of exercise are
inconsistent when examining resistance vs aerobic exercise (ref. 16),
with long term exercise exhibiting elevated αKlotho in sedentary
individuals (ref. 17). This hypothesis-generating research aims to
assess if αKlotho can serve as a circulating biomarker for bone
status, both in-ﬂight and upon return to weight-bearing.
Data are presented mean(SD). Plasma αKlotho in pg/ml was
~50% lower (Fig. 1) after 35 days in orbit aboard the ISS from the
FLIGHT mice vs GROUND. No differences were observed between
groups for FGF23 or inorganic phosphorus (Pi) concentration
(Table 1). Additionally, gastrocnemius muscle mass (g) was lower
(p = 0.0035) in FLIGHT vs GROUND after time in orbit aboard the
ISS (Table 1). For the hind limb unloading study, plasma αKlotho
after 30 days of tail suspension [HU-30day] was 36% lower vs
plasma αKlotho from mice that remained full weight bearing
[GROUND-30day; p < 0.01; Fig. 2]. Likewise, αKlotho was lower in
mice after the initial 30 days of HU vs all mice that were full-
weight bearing throughout the entire 80 day study, with or
without exercise [GROUND-No exercise; GROUND-Climbing; and
GROUND-Running; p < 0.05 for all comparisons)]. In contrast, after
returning to full weight-bearing from the 30 day period of HU,
plasma αKlotho levels remained lower in the mice that performed
no exercise [HU-No Exercise] vs plasma from the full weight
bearing mice as measured on Day 30 (p < 0.05). Additionally, these
mice that had not performed exercise after the 30 day period of
HU were also signiﬁcantly lower than all GROUND groups on Day
80, regardless of exercise (GROUND-No exercise; GROUND-
Climbing; GROUND-Running). In contrast, running exercise for
49 days after the initial 30 day HU period [HU-Running] resulted in
partial recovery of plasma Klotho, with no difference vs the full

weight bearing group at Day 30 (GROUND-30 Day), but still having
lower concentration (p < 0.05) vs GROUND-No Exercise. Climbing
exercise [HU-Climbing] for 49 days provided full recovery of
αKlotho (Fig. 2), being similar to all GROUND groups. No
differences were observed between any groups for FGF23
concentration (Fig. 3). Moreover, Pi level between GROUND-
30day and HU-30day was similar (Table 1). Sample limitation
prevented the assessment of other groups.
A reduction in plasma αKlotho levels was observed in both
FLIGHT and HU mice vs controls. While a mechanistic/causal link
between weight-bearing conditions and αKlotho are not deter-
mined, both reduced weight-bearing conditions did result in
lowered αKlotho. For HU mice, levels of αKlotho increased
following exercise, with partial recovery in the running group
and full recovery in the climbing group, suggesting an important
relationship between exercise/potentially elevated weight-bearing
and αKlotho level improvement. These data are aligned with
recovery of joint health upon a return to full weight-bearing with
exercise15. Moreover, for FLIGHT mice, where muscle masses were
collected, the decrease in αKlotho post-ﬂight occurred with
reduced gastrocnemius mass, which itself is not unexpected but
αKlotho may also be affected by skeletal muscle activity18.
When considering the importance αKlotho plays in maintaining
musculoskeletal skeletal health, viewed within the context of the
adverse effects of microgravity on bone, as well as muscle, these
ﬁndings suggest an important link between this hormone level
and skeletal health. Histologic changes of bone with altered
kidney physiology in relation to these hormonal changes are
needed to better understand this relationship. The similar changes
in αKlotho found in both FLIGHT mice and HU mice suggest that
HU mice may provide an appropriate terrestrial analog for
examining the relationship between αKlotho and health along
the musculoskeletal tissue-kidney axis.

approved IACUC protocols from Wake Forest School of Medicine,
NASA Ames, and the Kenney Space Center have been published15.
All mice were male, C57BL/6 (Jackson Labs) that were 10 weeks at
the start of each study.
ISS mission
Groups included FLIGHT and GROUND control15. This investigation
had access to n = 4–5 plasma samples/group collected after
35 days on orbit; all available samples were analyzed for this study.
HU study
Groups included weight-bearing GROUND mice, or HU via tail
suspension, as described15. On Day 30, plasma was isolated from a
cohort of GROUND (GROUND-30day) and HU (HU-30day) mice.
Remaining HU mice were then removed from tail suspension and
were thus weight-bearing the remainder of the study. All mice that
were previously GROUND or HU were enrolled into one of 3 exercise
groups, as described15, from Days 31–80, performing: 1] no exercise;
2] climbing exercise 3X weekly, or; 3] running exercise 3X weekly in
order to determine if recovery was possible with aerobic (running) or
a resistance (climbing) regimen, yielding the following six groups:
GROUND-No exercise; GROUND-Climbing; GROUND-Running; HU-No
exercise; HU-Climbing; and HU-Running. Climbing exercises were
performed 3X/week,. This investigation had access to n = 4 plasma
samples/group, all of which were analyzed.
Blood was collected in [K2]ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-
containing syringes by cardiac puncture and centrifuged for 10 min at
3000 rpm at 4 °C; Plasma was isolated and ELISA was used to detect
αKlotho (R&D Systems™#DY5334) and FGF23 (Abcam #ab213863); a
commercial Pi kit was also used (Pointe Scientiﬁc #P7516-500).
