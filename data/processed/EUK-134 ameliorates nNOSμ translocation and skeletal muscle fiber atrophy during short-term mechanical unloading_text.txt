January 29, 2014; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00371.2013.—Reduced mechanical
loading during bedrest, spaceﬂight, and casting, causes rapid morpho-
logical changes in skeletal muscle: ﬁber atrophy and reduction of
slow-twitch ﬁbers. An emerging signaling event in response to un-
loading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)
from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-
permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the
role of redox signaling in nNOS translocation and muscle ﬁber
atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer-
344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded
(HU), and hindlimb-unloaded  EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-
134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle
ﬁber atrophy and muscle ﬁber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOS
immunolocalization at the sarcolemma of the soleus was reduced with
HU, while nNOS protein content in the cytosol increased with
unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol
was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated de-
phosphorylation at Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading
elevated oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolem-
mal localization of Nox2 subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox,
effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our ﬁndings are consistent
with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOS translocation
from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early
event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve
as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in
skeletal muscle ﬁbers.

SKELETAL MUSCLE IS A HIGHLY specialized and adaptable meso-
dermic tissue capable of rapid remodeling in response to
changes in mechanical loading and stretch (28, 38). Transmit-
tance and detection of loading in skeletal muscle are paramount
in regulating differentiation, cell growth, and protein turnover.
The ability to sense and relay loading (i.e., mechanotransduc-
tion) is, in part, performed by proteins adjacent to and spanning
cell membranes (i.e., sarcolemma) in skeletal muscle (47).
Mechanical unloading that occurs with limb casting, splinting,
bed rest, and spaceﬂight, elicits a substantial loss of force-
generating capacity, linked to a diminishment in muscle ﬁber
cross-sectional area or atrophy (12, 23). The unloading pheno-
type also includes a shift of a portion of skeletal muscle ﬁbers
from slow-twitch to fast-twitch (12). Muscle atrophy that
occurs with unloading is coupled to a net loss of contractile
proteins, a function of increased protein degradation combined
with a decrease in protein synthesis (12, 23). Recent studies
emphasize the importance of proteolytic pathways, including
ubiquitin proteasome, calpains, autophagy, and caspase-3 in
triggering the early stages of atrophy (4, 10, 11, 26, 34, 35, 39).
For example, elevation of ubiquitin ligases with unloading is
initiated via dephosphorylation of FoxO3a and activation of
nuclear factor-B (NF-B) (26, 34, 42).
Elegant experiments by Suzuki et al. (42) ushered in a new
paradigm, whereby disassembly of skeletal muscle in response
to mechanical unloading is accelerated by translocation of
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the sarcolemma to
the sarcoplasm. The mu ()-splice variant of nNOS is a key
signaling protein located in the dystrophin-glycoprotein com-
plex (DGC) of skeletal muscle (29, 42), anchored through
binding of a PDX motif at its NH2 terminus to  and -syn-
trophins, and, thus, to dystrophin and dystrobrevin (13, 29).
Fourteen days of mechanical unloading of the soleus resulted
in movement of nNOS to the sarcoplasm, where nNOS
directly led to dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32, and
stimulated ubiquitin ligases and atrophy (42). Interestingly, the
loss of nNOS from the DGC also occurs in Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD), where it may exacerbate further
disruption of the DGC proteins, thus increasing susceptibility
to muscle damage and inﬂammation (19, 43). Furthermore,
knockout of the nNOS gene has been recently shown to elicit
myopathy and a reduction in contractile force (29). In addition,
new data from Ito et al. (15) demonstrate that nNOS activation
of the NADPH oxidase isoform Nox4 contributes to hypertro-
phy when skeletal muscle is overloaded. These data suggest in
total that nNOS may serve as an effector of dynamic changes
in mechanical loading, regardless of whether loading is in-
creased or decreased.
While the mechanisms underlying translocation of nNOS are
unknown, increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
subsequent oxidative stress is possible. For example, oxidative
stress from NADPH oxidase and possibly mitochondrial
sources play a role in damage in the mdx mouse model of
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where nNOS that is lost from
the sarcolemma contributes directly to pathology (17, 45).
Elevated skeletal muscle ROS from mitochondrial sources
during mechanical unloading has been reported by Powers and
colleagues (27). Recent data suggest that the Nox2 isoform of

NADPH oxidase, a gp91phox containing NADPH oxidase, is
important in stretch-induced Ca2 dyshomeostasis and damage
(17, 45). NADPH oxidase is a family of membrane-bound
oxidoreductases in nonphagocytic and phagocytic cells that
produce superoxide anions (O2·) in response to mechanical
strain, hypoxia, and damage (17). Elevated oxidative stress
from mitochondria and possibly Nox2 could result in a loss or
translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma (21, 41).
Therefore, we hypothesized that translocation of nNOS
during an early stage of mechanical unloading would be linked
to changes in oxidative stress and downstream dephosphory-
lation of FoxO3a at Thr-32. We further postulated that atten-
uation of oxidative stress would mitigate translocation of
nNOS from the sarcolemmal region and signiﬁcantly amelio-
rate two predominant phenotypic changes that begin early in
mechanical unloading: 1) muscle ﬁber atrophy and 2) ﬁber-
type shift from slow to fast. Previous antioxidant supplemen-
tation studies using nonspeciﬁc scavengers have yielded
inconsistent ﬁndings in reducing morphological responses
to unloading (3, 6, 20). In contrast, transfection of the
antioxidant enzyme catalase yielded signiﬁcant protection
against atrophy (9). To test the importance of redox signal-
ing, we used a novel cell-permeable, saline-manganese
compound (EUK-134), which mimics the catalytic function
of superoxide dismutase (SOD) coupled with catalase. In
addition, to target redox signaling that is active early in the
unloading process, and, therefore, involvement in initiation
of atrophy, we chose a 54-h period of hindlimb unloading
when oxidative stress is peaking (4).
METHODS
Animals. Young adult (4–6 mo) Fischer-344 (F344) rats were used
to model disuse via hindlimb unloading. Animals were housed and
cared for in accordance with National Institutes of Health policy
(NIH; DHEW publication no. 85–23, revised 1985). Procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Texas A&M University and meet all federal requirements, as deﬁned
in the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and the Public Health Service
Policy and the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rat
chow and water were provided ad libitum, and the animals were
maintained in a temperature-controlled room (23  2°C) with a
12:12-h light-dark cycle. Rodents are valuable mammalian models for
muscle wasting that occur in human disuse and unloading, with
changes in muscle ﬁber cross-sectional area, weakness, and ﬁber-type
shift from slow to fast, resembling responses in humans.
Hindlimb unloading. An adaptation of the rodent hindlimb unload-
ing model (7) was utilized to induce mechanical unloading. Brieﬂy,
the hindlimbs of the hindlimb unloading (HU) group were elevated to
a spinal orientation of 55° above horizontal. We secured the tail with
ﬂexible, orthopedic tape around the middle one-third of the tail. The
tail harness was attached to a linear mobile system with the line and
adjusted, so that the hindlimb paws were suspended, while the rats
were free to ambulate around the cage with their forelimbs for food
and water.
Experimental design. A hindlimb unloading period was chosen to
target the early phase of skeletal muscle remodeling during hindlimb
unloading. Markers of atrophy and oxidative stress are ﬁrst seen in the
hindlimb unloading model for limb muscles at 2–3 days (4). We used
a cell-permeable, catalytic saline-manganese compound developed by
Eukarion (EUK-134) as an intervention for elevated oxidative stress.
Adult F344 rats were divided into three groups (n 	 8/group): loaded
controls (CON), 54 h of hindlimb unloading, and hindlimb unloading  3
mg·kg1·day1 ip of the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 (HU-
EUK). This dosage used for EUK-134 was similar to that used by
Bianca et al. (5). Administration of EUK-134 commenced 24 h prior
to hindlimb unloading. The EUK series mimics the antioxidant en-
zymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase and, thus, remove
superoxide anions (O2·) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). SOD/cata-
lase mimetics have high speciﬁcity for O2·, H2O2, and low toxicity
with potential for translational use (32). EUK-134 had no effect on
endogenous antioxidant enzyme (e.g., MnSOD and Cu, ZnSOD)
protein levels (data not shown).
Skeletal muscle preparation. The soleus was chosen as a model of
skeletal muscle response to mechanical unloading. As a postural
muscle with a high percentage of Type I (slow-twitch) ﬁbers, the
soleus is susceptible to rapid atrophy and remodeling when exposed to
mechanical unloading (7). Following a dose of pentobarbital sodium
(100 mg/kg), the soleus muscles were carefully dissected, cleaned,
rinsed with Krebs-Ringer solution, laid along the longitudinal axis on
a polyurethane splint, and then frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid
nitrogen for histological analysis or directly in liquid nitrogen for
protein assays. Muscle samples were ground into homogenates with a
glass-on-glass pestle at a 26:1 dilution of lysis buffer cooled in
melting ice (4°C). The lysis buffer contained 20 mM HEPES free
acid, 10 mM HEPES Na salt, 350 mM mannitol, 10% glycerol, 25
mM KCL, and 0.5 mM EDTA. Homogenates were centrifuged 10 min
at 3,000 g at 4°C, and supernatant 1 was removed as the soluble
fraction. The pellet was resuspended (9:1 vol/vol) in buffer containing
20 mM HEPES free acid, 20 mM HEPES Na salt, 350 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM EDTA, and then centrifuged at
12,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant 1 was then centrifuged at
20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatant 2 from this spin served as the
cytosolic fraction and was veriﬁed using MnSOD. The remaining
pellet was the crude membrane fraction, which was resuspended in
buffer containing 20 mM HEPES free acid, 20 mM HEPES Na salt,
150 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM MgCl2, and
0.5 mM EDTA. Protein content was assessed using a Pierce BCA
protein assay kit.
Fiber-type analysis and morphology. We adapted a method for
ﬁber-type identiﬁcation previously described by Kanatous et al. (16).
Transverse muscle sections from the soleus of six animals per group
were cut (10 m) in a cryotome at 15°C and then air-dried for 30
min. Sections were placed in acidic (pH 	 4.25) or alkaline (pH 	
10.4) preincubation medium. The sections were rinsed thrice in 100
mM Tris buffer (pH 	 7.8) with 18 mM CaCl2 for 2 min each. Slides
were then placed in an ATP incubation solution (pH 	 9.4) for 25 min
at room temperature, and rinsed 3 times in 1% CaCl2 solution.
Sections were counterstained in 0.1% toluidine blue solution for 90 s
and then brieﬂy washed in dH2O. Sections were dehydrated in 95%
ethanol, twice in 100% ethanol, and then cleared in xylene 2 times (5
min each). Coverslips were then mounted with Vectamount (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Type I ﬁbers stain lightly with alka-
line preincubation. Type II ﬁbers have differential lability under acidic
conditions where Type IIa stain lightest and Type IIb/d ﬁbers stain
medium blue. Delp and Duan (8) previously estimated the ﬁber-type
distribution in Fischer-344 rats as 84% Type I, 7% Type IIa, and 9%
Type IId.
Muscle cross-sectional areas were measured, recorded, and cali-
brated against a stage micrometer. Images were captured on a Zeiss
Axioplot Vision-series microscope, and quantiﬁed using the NIH
ImageJ program. Six soleus muscles per group were analyzed with
each ﬁber cross-sectional area in square micrometer units calculated
using ImageJ against the stage micrometer standard. There were

400–600 ﬁbers/muscle quantiﬁed, with three groups of six samples,
for a total of nearly 9,000 ﬁbers analyzed for morphology and ﬁber
type.
Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. For histochemical and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays, muscle samples were mounted
and embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) medium. Cross
sections were cut at a temperature of 15°C in a Shandon Cryotome

FSE (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA) and dried for 30 min. For
visualization via hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) staining, each section
had a brief gentle rinse of dH2O after drying. Brieﬂy, soleus sections
were then incubated with alum hematoxylin for 4 min at room
temperature and rinsed with tap water to enhance bluing of nuclei.
Differentiation was induced to remove background with 75% ethanol
and 0.3% glacial acetic acid (acid-alcohol solution) for 15 min in a
Coplar jar. Following another brief rinse in tap water, sections were
incubated in eosin Y for 4 min at room temperature. Samples were
then dehydrated with two changes of 95% ethanol and two short
incubations (2 min) in 100% ethanol. Slides were cleared in xylene
and sealed under a cover slip in mounting media (Vector Laborato-
ries). Images were captured on an Olympus IX-51 (Olympus Imaging
America, Center Valley, PA) inverted epiﬂuorescence microscope.
For immunohistochemistry assays, muscle cross sections were cut
at 15°C and ﬁxed in acetone for 60 min. Sections were then blocked
in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 10% serum from a source matched
with the host of the secondary antibody. The appropriate primary
antibody for nNOS (1:50 dilution; Cayman 160870), gp91phox (1:
100; SC-5827; speciﬁc for Nox2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), and p47phox (1:100; Santa Cruz SC-7660) were applied in
blocking buffer and placed on each section for an hour. After washing
in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, biotinylated secondary antibody from
Vector Laboratories was applied to the sections (1:200 dilution) and
incubated in PBS buffer for 30 min. Cross sections were stained for 30
min with Vectastain Elite ABC reagent and incubated in NovaRed
peroxidase substrate solution (Vector Laboratories) for 5 min.
For nNOS localization, IHCs were also run using a TSA (tyramide
signal ampliﬁcation) kit (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) to enhance
localization of both sarcolemmal and cytosolic locations of nNOS, as
recommended by Punkt et al. (31). Within each protein of interest,
slides from samples in all three groups were completed during the
same day. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axioplot Vision-series
microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). Membrane
protein localization for p47phox and gp91phox was quantiﬁed using
an edge ﬁlter macrodeveloped for the NIH ImageJ software program.
Samples in each group were analyzed under identical conditions.
Immunoﬂuorescence. Soleus sections were cut 10 m thick in a
cryostat at 15°C and placed onto microscope slides. Sections were
dried for 30 min and ﬁxed in methanol (20°C) for 10 min, then
acetone (20°C) for 10 min. After 20 min of air-drying, samples were
washed for 5 min 3 times in PBS. Sections were then blocked in TBS
with 0.05% Tween 20, and 10% goat serum for 15 min. After air
drying for 10 min, primary antibodies (1:100 dilution) for 4-hy-
droxynonenal (Calbiochem; no. 393206) and laminin (Sigma; no.
L8271) were applied and incubated for 60 min in blocking buffer at
25°C. After three 10-min washes in PBS, sections were incubated in
the appropriate secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) with a ﬂuoro-
chrome attached (e.g., goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, goat anti-
mouse Alexa Fluor 594) for 30 min at room temperature. Sections are
washed thrice in PBS, and air-dried for 20 min. Slides were then
mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade medium (Invitrogen/Life Tech-
nologies, Grand Island, NY). Images were captured on a Zeiss
Axioplot Vision series microscope. The antibody used for 4-hy-
droxynonenal is speciﬁc for any protein adducted or attached to
4-HNE, a stable breakdown product of lipid peroxidation. Therefore,
visual 4-HNE adducts were used as a marker of damage or alteration
of muscle proteins by oxidative stress. 4-HNE and laminin localiza-
tion staining for all three groups were completed in a single day’s run
under the same conditions. We also veriﬁed sarcolemmal localization
of Nox2 subunits (gp91phox, p47phox) using -sarcoglycan, a mem-
brane protein integrated into the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.
Membrane protein localization for 4-hydroxynonenol (4-HNE) was
quantiﬁed using an edge ﬁlter macro developed for the NIH ImageJ
software program. Cell membranes were traced using the mem-
brane-binding protein laminin as a standard. Each sample among
groups was analyzed using the same procedure. The edge ﬁlter
width was set at 5 m.
Western immunoblot. Protein abundance was determined by West-
ern immunoblot analysis in the cytosolic and crude membrane frac-
tions. Twenty micrograms of protein were loaded on 10% polyacryl-
amide gels, and electrophoresed using a Bio-Rad Protein III gel-box.
Brieﬂy, separating gel (375 mM Tris·HCl; pH 	 8.8; 0.4% SDS; 10%
acrylamide) and stacking gel (125 mM Tris·HCl; pH 	 6.8; 0.4%
SDS; 10% acrylamide monomer) solutions were made, and polymer-
ization was initiated by TEMED and ammonium persulfate. Separat-
ing and stacking gels were quickly poured into a Bio-Rad Protein III
gel-box (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Soleus samples in sample buffer
(Tris pH 	 6.8 with 2% SDS, 30 mM DTT, 25% glycerol) were then
loaded into the wells of the gels, and electrophoresed at 150 V. The
gels were transferred at 30 V overnight onto a nitrocellulose mem-
brane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS
with 0.1% Tween-20 for 6 h and then incubated in the appropriate 1°
Ab. Antibodies for nNOS (BD: 610309) and FoxO3a phosphorylation
at Thr-32 (Cell Signaling: 9464) (1:1,000) were incubated for 12 h at
room temperature. Following three washings in PBS with 0.1%
Tween-20, membranes were incubated in a horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibody for 90 min. Then an enhanced chemi-
luminescence detection system (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) was used
for visualization. Densitometry and quantiﬁcation were performed
using the NIH ImageJ software program. The product of blot intensity
and area was used to identify abundance. To ensure equal loading of
protein, Ponceau-S-staining was performed for each membrane to
verify loading, and the lane background reading was subtracted from
each protein blot density reading. Membranes were stripped and
reprobed for GAPDH or dystrophin when normalizing for abundance
vs. a control protein. Both GAPDH and -actin were tested as loading
controls. Neither GAPDH nor -actin exhibited any mean differences
in protein abundance (Fig. 10).
Statistics. A one-way ANOVA was conducted for protein content,
mean muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), and ﬁber-type with Fisher-
LSD run post hoc to determine group mean differences. Analyses
were veriﬁed for normal distribution with variance homogenously
distributed among groups. A Chi-square test was used for determining
group differences among muscle ﬁber CSA proﬁles. Statistical sig-
niﬁcance was set at P  0.05.
RESULTS
Alterations in soleus muscle morphology with 54 h of me-
chanical unloading are regulated by oxidative stress. In the
ﬁrst experiment, we tested the hypothesis that reactive oxygen
species were a causal factor in the unloading-induced pheno-
type: reduction of muscle ﬁber cross-sectional and partial shift
of ﬁber type from slow-to-fast twitch. Previously, nitric oxide
synthase inhibition was shown to regulate muscle hypertrophy
and ﬁber-type shift in response to overloading (15, 38). In
addition, inhibition or genetic ablation of nNOS substantially
reduced proteolysis and muscle ﬁber atrophy during mechan-
ical unloading (42). nNOS may, indeed, be responsible for
guiding skeletal muscle remodeling in response to a dynamic
change in mechanical loading (42).
Body masses (means  SD) were not statistically different
among ambulatory control (435.1  17.6 g), hindlimb un-
loaded (437.4  22.4g), and hindlimb unloaded  EUK-134
(415.8  22.5 g). While the EUK-134 trended lower, their
mass also trended lower prior to the commencement of the
study. Soleus-to-body mass ratio trended lower for HU (158.6 
11.4 mg/kg) than CON (165.5  15.6 mg/kg) or HUEUK
(163.8  9.27 mg/kg) but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
Total protein concentration was signiﬁcantly lower in HU

(1,160  126 g/g) than CON (1,649  90 g/g), suggestive
of greater water and/or reduced protein levels during the early
phase of mechanical unloading. However, HU  EUK total
protein content (1,302  175 g/g) was not signiﬁcantly lower
than that of controls.
We quantiﬁed muscle CSA and observed that the ﬁber
cross-sectional area proﬁle (Fig. 1A) for the soleus exposed to
hindlimb unloading shifted to the left, illustrating a marked
reduction in muscle ﬁber cross-sectional area (Fig. 1B). The
greatest number of soleus ﬁbers was found in the 1,800–2,400
m2 range after unloading, in contrast with the 3,000–3,600
m2 range in the ambulatory control group. Remarkably,
muscle ﬁber atrophy was virtually completely abolished by
EUK-134 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we found that EUK-134
reduced muscle ﬁber atrophy primarily in Type I ﬁbers (Fig. 1,
A and B) but offered no protection in Type IIa and Type IIb/d
ﬁbers (Fig. 1, C and D).
To determine whether EUK-134 affected muscle mass and
ﬁber cross-sectional area, independent of unloading, we con-
ducted a set of follow-up control experiments. We tested 10
additional rats under loaded, ambulatory conditions, in which
rats received three saline or EUK-134 injections over a 78-h
period. This strategy covered the 54-h unloading period plus
the injection, given 24 h prior to HU. Body weights, soleus
mass (Fig. 2A), and the ratio of muscle mass to body mass (Fig. 2B)
were not different between the saline and EUK-134 groups. In
Fig. 1. Oxidative stress elicits muscle ﬁber
atrophy with mechanical unloading. Fifty-
four hours of hindlimb unloading reduced
muscle ﬁber size as displayed by ﬁber cross-
sectional area (CSA) distribution (A) for
CON, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and HU-
EUK rats (n 	 8/group). EUK-134 protected
against the left shift in muscle ﬁber CSA
distribution, indicating that oxidative stress
was causal in ﬁber atrophy in the early phase
of unloading. Muscle ﬁber atrophy was ap-
parent in slow-twitch of Type I ﬁbers of the
soleus (B) (P  0.01), but not in Type IIa
ﬁbers (C) or Type IIb/d ﬁbers (D) of the
soleus.a,bLetters that differ are signiﬁcantly
different from each other (P  0.05).

mass or ﬁber cross-sectional area in ambu-
latory rats. Seventy-eight hours EUK-134 or

soleus muscle mass (A), soleus mass/body
mass ratio (B), or soleus muscle cross-sec-
tional area (C).

addition, means for skeletal muscle ﬁber cross-sectional area
(Fig. 2C) did not signiﬁcantly differ between saline and EUK-
134-injected rats when loaded with normal ambulation. These
data are consistent with the notion that EUK-134’s effects on
skeletal muscle mass were speciﬁc to the unloading protocol.
We tested the hypothesis that unloading-induced shift of
skeletal muscle ﬁber-type from slow to fast was dependent on
oxidative stress. Representative ATPase stains with acid and
alkaline preincubation that are labile for Type II and Type I
ﬁbers, respectively, are displayed in Fig. 3A. Mechanical un-
loading caused a signiﬁcant reduction in the percentage of
Type I ﬁbers, as expected (Fig. 3B). In addition, hindlimb
unloading also caused an elevation in the percentage of Type
IIa- (Fig. 3C) and Type IIb/d (Fig. 3D)-positive ﬁbers. Re-
markably, EUK-134 virtually halted the unloading-induced
reduction in slow-twitch or Type I ﬁbers within the rat soleus
(Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with the effect on Type I ﬁbers,
EUK-134 also prevented elevation of fast-twitch Type IIa (Fig.

To our knowledge, these are the ﬁrst data to indicate that redox
signaling plays a signiﬁcant role in the ﬁber-type shift that
occurs in response to mechanical unloading.
EUK-134 attenuates nNOS translocation with hindlimb
unloading. In the next set of experiments, we tested the
hypothesis that perturbations in the location of nNOS would
be reduced by EUK-134. Hematoxylin-and-eosin stains are
presented in Fig. 4A. Using immunohistochemistry, we ini-
tially observed substantial delocalization of nNOS from the
sarcolemma as a result of short-term hindlimb unloading (Fig.
4, B and C). Suzuki et al. (42) had previously reported that
nNOS leaves the sarcolemma and is dispersed through the
sarcoplasm after 14 days of hindlimb unloading. Figure 4B
features IHCs for nNOS without tyramide signaling ampliﬁ-
cation (TSA), and Fig. 1C with TSA. Utilizing both methods,
we found that localization of nNOS at the sarcolemma was
dramatically reduced in the soleus by 54 h of hindlimb unload-
ing. However, cytosolic nNOS localization (29) was more
readily observed with TSA with the greatest positive staining
in the sarcoplasm within the HU  saline group. Remarkably,
3 days of injections with EUK-134 virtually prevented the loss

of nNOS-positive staining from the sarcolemmal region in
Fischer-344 rats (Fig. 4, B and C). Indeed, there was robust
positive staining of nNOS on the soleus muscle ﬁber periphery
in the EUK-treated group, similar to ambulatory control rats
injected with saline. Thus, we provide the ﬁrst evidence that
dislocation of nNOS may occur in less than 3 days of
mechanical unloading in the rat soleus muscle.
nNOS protein abundance measured via immunoblot paralled
our IHC ﬁndings. nNOS levels in the membrane fraction
levels, when equated for dystrophin, signiﬁcantly decreased in
the hindlimb unloading group when compared with ambulatory
controls (Fig. 4, D and E). Treatment with EUK-134 prevented
the reduction in membrane nNOS levels observed with HU,
consistent with localization results visualized in Fig. 4, B and
C. In contrast, nNOS protein abundance in soluble, cytosolic
fraction, equated per GAPDH levels, increased signiﬁcantly in
the HU group (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, EUK-134 prevented the
unloading-induced increase in cytosolic nNOS protein abun-
dance. Our immunohistological and protein localization data,
therefore, clearly demonstrate that nNOS is, indeed, translo-
cated away from the sarcolemma within the ﬁrst 54 h of
mechanical unloading. Furthermore, translocation of nNOS
with mechanical unloading appeared to be redox-signaling
dependent.
EUK-134 protects against unloading-related reduction in
FoxO3a phosphorylation (Thr-32). Important regulators of
muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading include FoxO3a
via dephosphorylation and NF-B via phosphorylation of its
inhibitor regulator IB (IB) (35). Suzuki et al. (42) dem-
onstrated that dephosphorylation and activation of FoxO3a
was dependent upon nNOS translocation from the sarco-
lemma to the cytosol. Given that EUK-134 attenuated nNOS
translocation with 54 h of HU, we tested the hypothesis that
EUK-134 would also attenuate loss of phosphorylation at
Thr-32 for FoxO3a. Levels of FoxO3a phosphorylation
(Thr-32) signiﬁcantly decreased with the short-term unload-
ing protocol (Fig. 5), as expected. EUK-134 treatment
resulted in an increase in phosphorylation levels at Thr-32
for FoxO3a during HU that were signiﬁcantly greater than
the soleus of unloaded rats injected with saline. In addition,
FoxO3a phosphorylation was not signiﬁcantly different in
the HU group injected with EUK-134.
Unloading-induced elevation of oxidative stress and Nox2 is
reduced by EUK-134. To determine whether EUK-134, indeed,
ameliorated unloading-induced oxidative stress in the soleus
muscle, we tracked 4-HNE-positive imaging. Previously, ele-
vation of oxidative stress in response to mechanical unloading
has been reported in both hindlimb unloading and mechanical
ventilation models (23, 24, 26). In the current study, we found
that 4-HNE protein adducts increased in the soleus following
54 h of hindlimb unloading (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, there was
increased localization of 4-HNE around the sarcolemma with
short-term unloading, using laminin immunoﬂuorescence in
parallel images to conﬁrm localization (Fig. 6B). Furthermore,
elevation in soleus 4-HNE ﬂuorescence caused by hindlimb
unloading was partially abrogated by EUK-134 treatment (Fig.
6A), conﬁrming the inhibitory effect of EUK-134 on oxidative
stress.
We also measured NF-B using an ELISA technique previ-
ously outlined (22). However, we saw no effects of HU or
EUK-134 (data not shown), suggesting the importance of
NF-B likely increases as unloading duration increases.
Given the potential for high oxidative stress in the sarcolem-
mal microenvironment (14) during mechanical unloading,
4-HNE oxidation, and upregulation of Nox2 noted in DMD
(46), we also determined immunolocalization of two Nox2
subunits: gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox. Short-term hindlimb
unloading, indeed, elevated immunostaining intensity at the
sarcolemma of the p47phox-positive in the soleus of F344 rats
(Fig. 7, B and D). The EUK-134 group displayed lower
gp91phox-positive sarcolemmal localization, while p47phox
sarcolemmal intensity levels in the EUK-134 group were not
signiﬁcantly different than controls (Fig. 7, A–C). Membrane-
positive staining for gp91phox was demonstrated using immu-
noﬂuorescence against -sarcoglycan as our membrane pro-
teins. gp91phox, -sarcoglycan, merged images, and negative
control are pictured in Fig. 8. We also determined p47phox
protein abundance using Western immunoblot analysis (Fig. 9).
p47phox levels were signiﬁcantly upregulated in both HU
groups. Combined with our DHE data, this is, to our knowl-
edge, the ﬁrst evidence that the Nox2 isoform of NADPH
oxidase in skeletal muscle is elevated in the ﬁrst 3 days of
mechanical unloading.
Both GAPDH and -actin were tested as loading controls.
Neither GAPDH nor -actin exhibited any mean differences in
protein abundance (Fig. 10).
DISCUSSION
In this study, EUK-134, a mimetic of superoxide dismutase
and catalase, attenuated the mechanical unloading or “space-

twitch ﬁber-type shift. EUK-134 protection of unloading-in-
duced muscle atrophy was linked to abrogation of nNOS
translocation away from the sarcolemma. Furthermore, EUK-
134 also prevented dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32,
previously shown to be regulated by nNOS translocation.
EUK-134 reduced oxidative stress and upregulation of Nox2.
A discussion of the principle ﬁnding follows.
EUK-134 attenuation of nNOS translocation and morpho-
logical changes. Our data indicate that unloading-induced
translocation of nNOS away from the sarcolemma is part of
an early adaptation to alterations in mechanotransduction dur-
ing the unloading process. Moreover, given that EUK-134
mitigated unloading-related upregulation of oxidative stress,
we propose nNOS translocation in response to mechanical
unloading in skeletal muscle is a redox-dependent phenome-
non. nNOS translocation has previously been associated with
increased FoxO3a activation and MuRF-1 activation and mus-
cle atrophy during ground hindlimb unloading (42) and during
91 days of spaceﬂight (33). In contrast, a new publication
indicates that nNOS is necessary in triggering an anabolic
signaling pathway involving Nox4 and mTOR, which responds
to overloading and regulates muscle hypertrophy (15). Further-
more, nitric oxide and NF-B were also found to be essential
for stretch-induced proliferation of myoblasts (40). Indeed,
inhibition of nitric oxide synthase has been shown to attenuate
muscle remodeling and ﬁber-type shift in response to altered
mechanical loading, whether the magnitude be increased or
decreased (15, 38, 42). Therefore, redox signaling may couple

with nNOS to regulate remodeling of skeletal muscle morphol-
ogy in response to dynamic changes in loading. In contrast,
nitric oxide appears not to be requisite for basal proliferation of
myoblasts and development (1, 39).
Intervention with EUK-134 not only mitigated unloading-
induced atrophy, but also appeared to arrest a shift away from
the slow-twitch phenotype in the rat soleus. This was an
unexpected ﬁnding, but potentially signiﬁcant, in understand-
ing regulation of slow- and fast-twitch ﬁbers in response to use
and disuse. For example, Smith et al. (38) reported that inhi-
bition of nitric oxide synthase abrogated a ﬁber-type shift from
fast to slow in the plantaris with increased loading as a result
of ablation of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, as they
are all plantar ﬂexor muscles. Therefore, we postulate that
nNOS translocation may contribute to a shift in ﬁber type from
slow to fast. We did note that EUK-134 protection against
muscle ﬁber atrophy was conﬁned to Type I ﬁbers. These
ﬁndings could be consistent with preferential response of Type
I ﬁbers by mechanical unloading or an unloading-induced shift
in muscle ﬁber type from slow-twitch ﬁbers, which are para-
doxically larger in the soleus (Fig. 1). It is possible that the
time course of the study (54 h) may be too short to elicit
morphological alterations in Type II ﬁbers. In addition, the
shift from slow- to fast-twitch ﬁbers may seek to preserve
cross-sectional area. Thus, additional study is warranted.
EUK-134 protection of FoxO3a phosphorylation. EUK-134
ameliorated the reduction in phosphorylation of FoxO3a at
Thr-32 caused by hindlimb unloading (Fig. 5), thus reducing a
trigger of proteolysis and ﬁber atrophy (9). Previously, Suzuki
et al. (42) demonstrated that translocation of nNOS and cyto-
solic nitric oxide release by nNOS were required to dephos-
phorylate FoxO3a in the rat soleus during 14 days of mechan-
ical unloading. FoxO3a activation stimulates upregulation of
the ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 (42). Therefore,

protection against FoxO3a dephosphorylation at Thr-32 by
EUK-134 is consistent with a pathway, whereby oxidative
stress participates in translocation of nNOS with mechanical
unloading, directly leading to FoxO3a activation, as well as
increased proteolysis through ubiquitin ligases (e.g., MuRF-1),
leading to ﬁber atrophy (42).
Oxidative stress and mechanical unloading. Our results are
consistent with the hypotheses that oxidative stress 1) is ele-
vated early during mechanical unloading in skeletal muscle and
2) contributes signiﬁcantly to the atrophy as a consequence of
unloading. Protective effects of EUK-134 were speciﬁc to
changes caused during the unloading protocol, as EUK-134
injections had no effect on normally loaded skeletal muscle
mass or morphology (Fig. 2). Furthermore, elevated oxidative
stress, as detected with 4-hydroxynonenal, was attenuated with
EUK-134, which corresponded with sparing of muscle ﬁber
atrophy.
Elevation of oxidative stress after 54 h of mechanical un-
loading of the rat soleus is consistent with previous studies that
indicate oxidative stress is elevated during the ﬁrst few days of
mechanical unloading. Localization of 4-HNE adducts near the
sarcolemma (Fig. 6) suggests a source nearby (e.g., Nox2,
subsarcolemmal mitochondria). Previously, Abrogast et al. (4)
reported that oxidative stress was elevated in unloaded skeletal
muscle after 1–3 days. Bowman-Birk inhibitor complex (BBIC),
which exhibits antiproteasome and antioxidant properties, sig-
niﬁcantly reduced unloading-induced ﬁber atrophy and reduc-
tion of force-generating capacity (4). In addition, Powers and
colleagues (48) also demonstrated that elevation in oxidative
stress occurs in just 12–24 h of unloading in the diaphragm
muscle during mechanical ventilation. In a series of studies,
oxidative stress was found to be causal in stimulating apoptosis
and muscle ﬁber atrophy in the unloaded diaphragm muscle
(25, 26, 34, 48). Recently, transfection of catalase in the soleus
has been shown to reduce soleus muscle atrophy during leg
immobilization, while lowering oxidative stress (9).
It should be noted that evidence supportive of a contribution
of oxidative stress in eliciting muscle atrophy with unloading
has not been consistent across studies. Indeed, while some
antioxidant strategies have been successful in reducing skeletal
muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading (4, 25, 30), other
interventions have not (6, 20). For example, administration of
BBIC signiﬁcantly attenuated muscle atrophy in limb muscles
(4), while Trolox was less successful (6). Vitamin E reduced
unloading-induced atrophy when preinjected for 21 days (3),
while a broad, nonspeciﬁc cocktail of antioxidants was inef-
fective (20).
However, more recent, mechanistic studies indicate that
ROS play an important role in unloading-induced atrophy. For
example, catalase transfection suppressed activation of

FoxO3a and NF-B, while attenuating one-half of the soleus
mass loss during 7 days of unloading (9). Inhibition of mito-
chondrial oxidative stress using SS-31 also signiﬁcantly ame-
liorated muscle atrophy in a casting model of mechanical
unloading (27). The reasons underlying differential responses
to antioxidant strategies have not been resolved, but length of
time, localized effects, speciﬁcity, and catalytic vs. scavenger
approaches could all play a role. It is also possible that
antioxidant therapeutics may be more effective in the early
phase of mechanical unloading (1–7 days) than in later phases
(14 days).
While redox regulation of subsarcolemmal proteins, includ-
ing nNOS in skeletal muscle remains poorly understood, there
is growing acceptance that ROS sources participate in subcel-
lular regulation of microenvironments, including Nox2 signal-
ing in caveolae and lipid rafts (18, 44). We found increased
Nox2 subunit localization at the membrane (Fig. 4) and ele-
vated protein abundance of p47phox (Fig. 9); however, we
cannot conclude a causal relationship. In addition, it is possible
that Nox2 could serve to amplify or augment mitochondrial
ROS (27), recently established as a causal factor in disuse-
related atrophy.
Study limitations. Recent studies have suggested that the
cytokine TNF- may play a signiﬁcant role in apoptosis and
ubiquitin ligase activation in skeletal muscle during mechani-
cal unloading (2). It is possible that EUK-134 might play a
protective role in unloading-induced atrophy by suppressing
TNF- levels, possibly via NF-B. However, we found no
change in NF-B activity with unloading or EUK-134 at this
stage of mechanical unloading.
It is possible that under high levels (mM) of H2O2 EUK-134
may oxidize to oxo-EUK and quench nitric oxide (·NO) (37).
While H2O2 levels in skeletal muscle are believed to exist in
the high-nM to low-M range, future experiments could spe-
ciﬁcally inhibit iNOS as a source of RNS. In addition, high
levels of EUK-134 at the tissue level may also remove or
prevent the production of peroxynitrite (OONO). Thus, it is
possible that nNOS may contribute to its own dislocation. It is
also possible that mechanical unloading affects nNOS via
transcriptional regulation rather than posttranslational mecha-
nisms or interaction with other proteins (e.g., caveolin-3).
These provocative questions should be foci of future investi-
gations.
In summary, translocation of nNOS during short-term
mechanical unloading in the rat soleus was reduced by the
SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 and linked to protection
against muscle ﬁber atrophy and ﬁber-type shift from slow to
fast. In addition, prevention of nNOS translocation by EUK-
134 was directly associated with protection against dephos-
phorylation of FoxO3a. Finally, EUK-134 reduced oxidative
stress and normalized Nox2 levels. Our results suggest that loss
of nNOS from the sarcolemma is an early, redox-dependent
event in the response to mechanical unloading, linked to
morphological changes in skeletal muscle phenotype.
