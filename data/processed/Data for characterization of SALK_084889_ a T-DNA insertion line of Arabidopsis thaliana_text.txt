In this article we report the identiﬁcation of T-DNA (transfer DNA)
insertion sites within two different gene regions in the genome of
an Arabidopsis mutant line, SALK_084889. The T-DNA positions are
in the 30 UTR (untranslated region) of DREB2A (Dehydration-
responsive element-binding protein 2A) (AT5G05410) and pro-
moter of LOX1 (Lipoxygenase 1) (AT1G55020) as determined by
DNA-PCR and sanger sequencing. The expression levels of DREB2A
and LOX1 were also analyzed using quantitative realtime PCR
(qPCR) in SALK_084889 and wild type Arabidopsis (Col, Columbia).
Further, the comparison of drought and heat tolerance between
Col and SALK_084889 were conducted by stress treatments. The
present data indicate that in SALK_084889, the expression of
DREB2A is not downregulated under normal growth conditions
but can be affected only in roots under drought treatment, while
LOX1 is signiﬁcantly downregulated in both roots and shoots
under all tested conditions. These data are original and have not
been published elsewhere.

Experimental
features
DNA-PCR was employed to identify the T-DNA insertion sites in SALK_084889
genome within DREB2A 30 UTR and LOX1 promoter region, respectively. Then
SALK_084889 plants were subjected to qPCR to examine the expression levels of
DREB2A and LOX1. The drought and heat responses of SALK_084889 were also
performed.

Value of the data
 T-DNA insertion lines provide important resource for genetic analysis based on mutagenesis in
plant research. SALK lines are the most widely used T-DNA insertion lines for the model plant
Arabidopsis. Accurate assessment of insertions is critical for understanding the value of the
insertion lines.
 SALK_084889 is annotated as a T-DNA insertion line of DREB2A, a key regulator of drought and heat
response in Arabidopsis. We characterized DREB2A expression in normal and drought conditions in
this line, which is relevant for analysis of DREB2A mutants in further investigation.
 The LOX1 gene plays a critical role in multiple bioprocesses associated with lipid peroxidation. Our
data identiﬁed a T-DNA insertion within promoter of LOX1 and showed the knock-out expression of
LOX1 in SALK_084889. These are valuable information for mutation analysis of LOX1.

2. Experimental design, materials and methods
Arabidopsis seeds of wild tyoe (Col) and SALK_084889 were obtained from Arabidopsis Biological
Resource Center. SALK_084889 was reported as a T-DNA insertion line of DREB2A (AT5G05410) gene
[1]. For identiﬁcation of T-DNA insertion sites, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown in soil at 22 °C
under constant light condition. Eight randomly selected SALK_084889 seedlings were subjected to
DNA-PCR to conﬁrm all seeds are homozygous. For DREB2A, the gene speciﬁc primers DREB2A-F and

DREB2A-R were used to amplify wild type allele band while LBb1.3 and DREB2A-R primers were used
to amplify T-DNA band. For LOX1, the gene speciﬁc primers LOX1-F and LOX1-R were used to amplify
wild type allele band while LBb1.3 and LOX1-R primers were used to amplify T-DNA band. The
amplicons of T-DNA bands of DREB2A and LOX1 were puriﬁed by subjected to sanger sequencing and
the alignment of sequences was performed using Vector NTI v10.0 program (InforMax Inc). For
Expression analysis, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown in 0.5  MS media (2.2 g of MS basal
salts (Sigma), 5 g of Sucrose, 0.5 g of MES, and 1 mL of 1,000  Gamborg vitamins (Sigma) per liter at
pH 5.75) at 22 °C under constant light condition. The 14 day old plants were harvested from MS plates
and directly preserved in RNALater (Ambion) [2]. For drought treatment, harvested Arabidopsis plants
were dehydrated on Whatman 3mm paper (Whatman) at 22 °C and 60% humidity under dim light for
2 h [3] prior to ﬁxation in RNALater. For RNA extraction, root and shoot tissues were dissected in
RNALater solution and then total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Quanti-
tative realtime PCR was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) and 2-ΔΔCt
method was employed to calculate the relative expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1. Three replicates
were used for each sample and UBQ11 (AT4G05050) gene was used as the internal control. For
drought and heat tolerance determination of SALK_084889, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown
in soil at 22 °C under constant light condition. For drought test, the 10 day old plants were transferred
to pre-dried soil and withhold water for 4 days prior to recovery by watering for 7 days [4]. For heat
test, the 7 day old plants were pre-incubated in 37 °C for 1 h and then treated at 49 °C for 1 h prior to

between Col and SALK_084889 (** po0.01).
