Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are persistent inhabitants of human spaceﬂight
habitats and represent potential opportunistic pathogens. The effect of the human
spaceﬂight environment on the growth and the frequency of mutations to antibiotic
resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was
investigated. Six cultures of the test organism were cultivated in biological research in
canisters–Petri dish ﬁxation units for 122 h on orbit in the International Space Station
(ISS) as part of the SpaceX-3 resupply mission. Asynchronous ground controls (GCs)
consisted of identical sets of cultures cultivated for 122 h in the ISS Environmental
Simulator at Kennedy Space Center. S. epidermidis exhibited signiﬁcantly lower viable
counts but signiﬁcantly higher frequencies of mutation to rifampicin (Rif) resistance in
space vs. GC cultures. The spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene leading to RifR was
altered in S. epidermidis isolates cultivated in the ISS compared to GCs. The results
suggest that the human spaceﬂight environment induces unique physiologic stresses
on growing bacterial cells leading to changes in mutagenic potential.

INTRODUCTION
Planning is currently underway for future long-duration missions through interplanetary space
to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars (NASA, 2015). Both the National Research Council
(NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high
priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration;
furthermore, these agencies have recognized the International Space Station (ISS) as the best
available platform to conduct research activities to address these challenges (International Space
Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), 2013; National Research Council [NRC], 2014).
Studies conducted during short- and medium-duration missions (from a few days up
to ∼1 year) in vehicles such as Spacelab, Soyuz, Shuttle, Mir, and ISS have provided a wealth of

Spontaneous rpoB Mutations in Spaceﬂight
information concerning astronaut health and function in the
spaceﬂight environment of low-Earth orbit (LEO; Taylor, 2015).
Based on the knowledge gained from these missions, NASA
has developed successful risk mitigation strategies. However,
long-duration missions (greater than 1 year) into interplanetary
space are more likely to expose astronauts to new and higher
risks to their health and performance than excursions to LEO,
primarily due to: (i) chronic exposure to microgravity; (ii)
increased exposure to ionizing radiation from solar and galactic
sources; and (iii) extreme conﬁnement and isolation (Reitz,
2008; NRC, 2011; Zeitlin et al., 2013; Taylor, 2015). One
particular concern for planners of long-duration missions is
the possibility of infectious disease (Scott-Conner et al., 2015;
Taylor, 2015). Prolonged exposure to the stresses of spaceﬂight
can lead to dysregulation of astronauts’ immune systems, thus
increasing their susceptibility to infectious disease (Crucian et al.,
2009; Guéguinou et al., 2009; Taylor, 2015). To minimize the
possibility of bringing infectious disease agents onboard, pre-
launch mitigation protocols are in place such as screening
astronauts for certain microbes and irradiation of food (NASA,
2010). However, the essential nature of the human microbiome
(Cho and Blaser, 2012) renders it impossible to remove all
potentially infectious microorganisms from astronauts. Indeed,
deterioration of astronauts’ immune systems in space has
led to increased reactivation of latent viral infections by
Varicella–Zoster, Epstein–Barr, and Cytomegalovirus during 12–
16 day Shuttle ﬂights (Mehta et al., 2014). Opportunistic
bacterial infections of the urinary tract, upper respiratory tract,
and subcutaneous tissue have been documented from Shuttle
missions STS-1 to STS-108 (Sams, 2009), and conjunctivitis,
respiratory tract, and dental infections were documented among
long-term inhabitants of space station Mir (Ball and Evans, 2001).
Numerous studies have been conducted to understand
how bacteria themselves respond to the human spaceﬂight
environment, with particular regard to the possibility of their
enhanced pathogenic potential or resistance to antimicrobial
treatments [reviewed extensively in Rosenzweig et al. (2014)].
In some spaceﬂight experiments, it has been observed that
spaceﬂight can lead to enhanced virulence in some bacteria
(Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa), but not in others (S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus
aureus MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes;
note: in S. typhimurium, both cases have been observed in
diﬀerent spaceﬂight experiments; reviewed in Rosenzweig et al.,
2014). Taken together, the data suggest that the combined
phenomena of altered astronaut immunity and heightened
virulence of some microbes in the spaceﬂight environment might
lead to an increased incidence of astronaut infections by some
opportunistic pathogens during extended missions (Klaus and
Howard, 2006).
Space stations start out as basically clean environments,
but
upon
habitation,
they
are
rapidly
colonized
by
numerous
environmental
and
astronaut-associated
species
of microorganisms, which proceed to adapt and evolve in
response to selective pressures unique to the spaceﬂight
environment (Novikova, 2004; van Tongeren et al., 2007).
A number of opportunistic pathogens have been isolated from
space station crew quarters and from astronauts, including both
Gram-positive genera (Bacillus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus,
and Streptococcus) and Gram-negative genera (Citrobacter,
Enterobacter,
Escherichia,
Flavobacterium,
Haemophilus,
Klebsiella, Morganella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Serratia,
Stenotrophomonas, and Yersinia; Ilyin, 2005; Klaus and Howard,
2006). From studies of astronauts on space stations Mir and
ISS, it was documented that the microbial diversity of the
upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was lowered during
spaceﬂight, while the proportion of opportunistic pathogens
increased. In addition, extensive exchange of microbial ﬂora
of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts has been
documented among astronauts sharing conﬁned space habitats
[reviewed in Taylor and Sommer (2005)]. Recent microbial
monitoring of the ISS environment revealed that Bacillus
and Staphylococcus spp., are the most ubiquitous organisms
cultured from the ISS, being especially abundant in samples
taken from crew quarters, vacuum debris, and HEPA ﬁlters
(Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska et al., 2015). Not
surprisingly, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequently
encountered organism in the ISS microbiome, due to its close
association with humans as a skin commensal (Venkateswaran
et al., 2014).
As on Earth, antibiotics are the predominant treatment of
choice for bacterial infections on human spaceﬂight missions.
Knowledge about the eﬃcacy of antimicrobial interventions to
treat infections during spaceﬂight is limited, given the diﬃculty
to assess the interplay between pharmacokinetics of antibiotics
or the physiologies of host and microbiome, both of which are
altered in the spaceﬂight environment (Wotring, 2012; Taylor,
2015). Decreased susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics has
been observed in the space environment during experiments
performed on Salyut 7 (Tixador et al., 1985) and the Space
Shuttles Challenger (Lapchine et al., 1986) and Discovery (Tixador
et al., 1994).
Mutation is a common mechanism by which bacteria become
resistant to antibiotics. A body of evidence indicates that the
spectrum of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance can
be altered by the environment to which microbes are exposed
(Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Nicholson and Park, 2015),
including the spaceﬂight environment (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the
experiments described here, we chose to study mutations leading
to resistance to the antibiotic rifampcin (Rif), because: (i) Rif is
a clinically relevant antibiotic used singly and in combination
to treat a wide variety of infections; and (ii) RifR mutations are
easily identiﬁed by nucleotide sequencing, as they reside within
small regions of the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNA
polymerase (Severinov et al., 1993).
Taken together, the above observations indicate that the
possibility must be considered of antibiotic-resistant strains
emerging, and potentially becoming dominant types, in the
microbiomes of crew members. Therefore, to explore the
development of antibiotic resistance in a potential opportunistic
pathogen during long-term human habitation in space, the

of mutation to RifR, were measured after spaceﬂight on the ISS
and compared to asynchronous ground controls (GCs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strain, Media, and Growth
Conditions
The strain used was S. epidermidis strain ATCC12228 obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA.
Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY)
medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5;
yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; and ﬁnal pH 7.
For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. As
appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif; Sigma–Aldrich) was
added to TSY at a ﬁnal concentration of 5 µg/mL.
Sample Preparation
Staphylococcus epidermidis cells were prepared by overnight
growth in TSY liquid medium and a calibration curve was
constructed relating Optical Density at 660 nm (OD660) to viable
cell titer. Overnight cultures were diluted in TSY to a working
concentration of 108 CFU per mL prior to use. Aliquots of 0.1 mL
(∼107 CFU) of the suspension were applied to the bottoms of
sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon cat. no. 1007) and
air-dried for 48–72 h at room temperature prior to use.
BRIC Spaceﬂight Hardware
The experiments described here utilized BRIC spaceﬂight
hardware, which has been described in detail previously (Paul
et al., 2012). BRIC canisters hold six 60-mm diameter Petri
dish bottom halves in small subcompartments called Petri dish
ﬁxation units (PDFUs). Each PDFU allows for injection of
medium, referred to as actuation, to initiate bacterial growth. For
ﬂight (FL) experiments, one BRIC canister was used containing
six PDFUs. Immediately, adjacent to the FL canister was deployed
a HOBO
R⃝
temperature data logger (Onset Computer Co.,
Bourne, MA, USA). Post-ﬂight asynchronous GC experiments
were conducted using the same hardware and conﬁguration as
in the FL experiment. Each PDFU was loaded with a Petri dish
containing air-dried cells, and 13 mL of sterile TSY medium
was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination,
all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use
and PDFUs were assembled using aseptic technique within a
biological containment hood.
Spaceﬂight Timeline
The BRIC–PDFU payload described above was the 18th BRIC
mission to space, and was designated BRIC-18. The BRIC-
18 hardware payload was launched on the third SpaceX cargo
resupply mission to the ISS (SpaceX-3) on April 18, 2014, using
the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule conﬁguration. The
Dragon capsule docked with the ISS on April 21, 2014. The
BRIC canister was transferred to the ISS on April 22, 2014 and
stowed in the US laboratory module. Actuation of the PDFUs
was performed on April 30, 2014 at 10:08 EDT (Figure 1A) and
samples were incubated at ISS ambient temperature (Figure 1B)
until May 5, 2014 at 12:04 PM EDT, resulting in a total incubation
time of 122 h. Growth was terminated by transfer of the BRIC
canister to the onboard −80◦C MELFI freezer. Samples were
returned to Earth in the Dragon capsule on May 18, 2014 and
were maintained in the frozen state until return to Kennedy Space
Center (KSC) for de-integration and further processing.
Ground Control Timeline
Asynchronous GC experiments were performed in a BRIC
canister according to the timeline determined during the
FL experiment. Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS
Environmental Simulation Chamber following the temperature
regime recorded during ﬂight (Figure 1B), and growth was
terminated by transfer to a −80◦C freezer, where samples were
stored until further processing.
Post-Experiment Sample Processing
Both FL and GC BRIC canisters were transferred from
storage at −80◦C to a +4◦C refrigerator and allowed to
thaw overnight. Petri dishes were removed from PDFUs and
cells were resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas.
Resuspended cultures were transferred to sterile 50-mL conical
centrifuge tubes, and the total volume recovered was measured.
For viable counts, aliquots from cultures were diluted serially
10-fold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY, and colonies
counted after incubation at 37◦C for 24 h to obtain CFU/mL. To
obtain the total CFU per PDFU, the CFU/mL were multiplied
by the volume of liquid recovered. To select for RifR mutants,
cultures were concentrated by centrifugation, plated without
dilution onto TSY + Rif plates, and colonies counted after
incubation at 37◦C for 24 h. The frequency of mutation to RifR
was calculated by dividing the total number of RifR mutants by
the total number of viable cells from each culture. Individual RifR
mutants were streak-puriﬁed on TSY + Rif plates and processed
for DNA sequencing.
DNA Sequencing and Analyses
Primers used for PCR ampliﬁcation of two RifR regions of the
S. epidermidis rpoB gene are listed in Table 1. The corresponding
rpoB regions were ampliﬁed by PCR directly from cells as
previously described (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002) and their
nucleotide sequences determined at the University of Florida
Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR).
Multiple rpoB sequences were aligned using the online Clustal
Omega server1 to identify the position of mutations relative to the
wild-type rpoB sequence obtained in parallel from S. epidermidis
ATCC12228.
Statistical Analyses
Non-parametric statistical parameters and tests of signiﬁcance
(Kruskal–Wallis) were computed on log10-transformed data
using Kaleidagraph version 4.5.2 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA,
USA).

RESULTS
Temperature Data in FL vs. GC
Experiments
Temperature data were logged at 10-min intervals during the FL
and GC experiments and the data are presented in Figure 1B.
The average temperature recorded during the growth period in
FL was 25.1 ± 0.12◦C until 107 h, at which time the immediately
adjacent FL HOBO unit malfunctioned for the duration of the
experiment (Figure 1B). However, the HOBO malfunction did
not aﬀect the course of the FL experiment, as other HOBO units
in nearby BRIC canisters functioned correctly and conﬁrmed
a nominal temperature proﬁle (data not shown). The average
temperature in the GC experiment was 24.8 ± 0.16◦C, diﬀering
from the FL experiment by only 0.3◦C. The HOBO unit in the GC
experiment performed nominally for the entire 122 h duration of
the experiment (Figure 1B).

counts were signiﬁcantly higher in the GC cultures (Figure 2A).
To determine the frequency of mutation to RifR, cells from the FL
and GC cultures were concentrated by centrifugation and plated
onto TSY + Rif. FL cultures of S. epidermidis exhibited a 24-fold
higher frequency of mutation to RifR than did GC cultures, and
this diﬀerence was found to be highly signiﬁcant (Figure 2B).
Spectrum of RifR rpoB Mutations in FL
vs. GC Experiments in S. epidermidis
Chromosomal DNA was isolated from a total of 67 FL and 57
GC RifR mutants, and the N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III
of their rpoB genes were ampliﬁed by PCR and sequenced. The
data are presented in Tables 2 and 3 and summarized graphically
in Figure 3. Examination of the data revealed notable diﬀerences
in the mutational spectrum within rpoB between the FL and GC
samples.
N-Cluster
No mutations were detected in the N-cluster of the S. epidermidis
rpoB gene in either the FL or GC samples.
Cluster I
All of the RifR mutations identiﬁed in both FL and GC samples
of S. epidermidis were found to occur in Cluster I (Table 2;
Figure 3). In agreement with previous reports (Severinov et al.,
1993; Campbell et al., 2001; Nicholson and Maughan, 2002;
Perkins et al., 2008), the most common amino acid changes in
Cluster I leading to RifR were found at amino acids Q469, H482,
and S487. At codon Q469, both FL (3/8) and GC (4/4) samples
exhibited C-to-A transversions in the ﬁrst position leading to a
Q469K substitution (Table 2; Figure 3). However, FL samples
also exhibited two changes at the second position of codon
Q469; an A-to-T transversion and an A-to-G transition, leading
to the amino acid substitutions Q469L and Q469R, respectively
(Table 2; Figure 3). Together, these two mutations accounted for

5/8, or 63% of the total mutations found in FL samples, but were
not represented at all in GC samples.
At codon H482 were found the majority of RifR mutations in
GC samples (40/57 total, or 70%). In comparing the spectrum
of RifR mutations between FL and GC samples, it was observed
that all of the RifR mutations identiﬁed in the GC samples were
found to occur at the ﬁrst position of codon H482, either C-to-G
transversions leading to substitution H482Y (33/35, or 94%), or
C-to-T transitions leading to H482D (2/35, or 6%). FL samples
also exhibited these same mutations (4/6, or 67% for H482Y; 1/6
or 17% for H482D, respectively; Table 2; Figure 3). In addition,
a single mutation was identiﬁed at the second position of codon
H482 only in FL samples; this was an A-to-G transition resulting
in an H482R substitution (Table 2; Figure 3).
At codon R485, G-to-A transitions were detected at the second
position in both FL and GC samples, leading to an R485H amino
acid substitution at a slightly higher frequency in GC samples
(7/57 total, or 12%) than in FL samples (3/67 total, or 4.5%;
Table 2; Figure 3).
At codon, S487 was found the majority of RifR mutations in
FL samples (47/67 total, or 70%). The largest proportion of RifR
mutations in both FL samples (42/47, or 89%) and GC samples
(8/10, or 80%) were found to consist of C-to-T transitions at the
second position, resulting in the S487F substitution (Table 2 and
Figure 3). The remaining mutations at S487 consisted of C-to-
T transitions at the second position, resulting in the amino acid
substitution S487Y, found in 5/47 (11%) of FL samples and 2/10
(20%) of GC samples, respectively.
Double Mutations in FL Samples
Sequence analysis of RifR mutations in S. epidermidis rpoB
revealed two double mutations in FL samples that were not
detected in GC samples (Table 2 and Figure 3). The ﬁrst resulted
in the double amino acid change D472Y + S487C and the second

resulted in the double amino acid change E461Q + Q469K. While
the single amino acid changes D472Y and Q469K have both been
associated with RifR in other species, namely E. coli (Severinov
et al., 1993) and Bacillus subtilis (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002),
at present it is unclear if single mutations in rpoB leading to the
E461Q or S487C substitutions by themselves can confer RifR in
S. epidermidis.
Distribution of RifR rpoB Mutations by PDFU
Examination of Table 2 indicated that in some PDFUs an
unusually high number of repeats of the same RifR mutant were
found. For example, 12 out of 17 RifR mutants sequenced from
FL PDFU-1 were S487F, and 7 out of 10 mutants sequenced from
GC PDFU-2 were H482Y (Table 2). These data suggested that
some of the populations in both FL and GC samples contained
“jackpots,” i.e., cultures in which the progeny of early-arising RifR
mutants became over-represented in the ﬁnal culture (Foster,
2006), which may have skewed the results reported in Table 2
and their interpretation. We therefore re-analyzed the data by
counting each type of mutation as either “present” (at least once)
or “absent” in each PDFU, the results of which are presented
in Table 3. When re-examined in this way, diﬀerences in the
distribution of RifR mutants in FL vs. GC samples were still
apparent. For example, the Q469L mutation was found in three
FL PDFUs, but in zero GC PDFUs (Table 3). Conversely, present
in nearly all GC PDFUs were the H482Y (6/6) and R485H (5/6)
mutations but these mutations were present in only two FL
PDFUs (Table 3). In addition, it appeared that the mutation
leading to S487F was predominant in both FL (6/6) and GC (5/6)
PDFUs, suggesting that mutation at this site was not aﬀected by
spaceﬂight (Table 3).
Transition vs. Transversion Mutations in
FL and GC Samples
As reported above, diﬀerences were observed in the location
of rpoB mutations in FL vs. GC samples in S. epidermidis
RifR mutants. These observations prompted us to examine the
nature of nucleotide changes (i.e., transition vs. transversion
mutations) in cells cultivated in spaceﬂight and on the ground.
Examination of the distribution of transitions and transversions
in S. epidermidis samples revealed the G:A and C:T transitions,
and C:A and C:G transversions, were found both in FL and
GC samples (Table 3). However, FL samples also exhibited A:G
transitions and A:T, G:T, and G:C transversions that were not
found in GC samples. Thus, the spectrum of mutational classes
(transitions vs. transversions) was also altered in FL vs. GC
samples.
DISCUSSION
The observations that (i) astronaut immune function becomes
dysregulated during long-term spaceﬂight (Guéguinou et al.,
2009; Crucian et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015); (ii) certain opportunistic
bacteria can upregulate virulence functions in spaceﬂight
(Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015); and (iii) spaceﬂight can
alter the antibiotic resistance proﬁles of bacteria (Lapchine et al.,
1986; Tixador et al., 1994) have underscored the importance
of studying the causes and consequences of the development
of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human spaceﬂight
environment. Understanding how microgravity aﬀects the
development of not only bacterial antibiotic resistance, but of
bacterial growth and metabolism in general, has been diﬃcult
to achieve despite substantial interest in the topic (reviewed in
Nickerson et al., 2004; Klaus and Howard, 2006; Horneck et al.,
2010). This results from the inherent limitations of performing
microbiological research in spaceﬂight, due to infrequent
opportunities to access spaceﬂight habitats, and limitations on the
ability to perform large-scale, well-controlled, multireplicate, on-
board experiments in the spaceﬂight environment. In particular,
DNA damage, repair, and mutagenesis of bacteria inhabiting
the human spaceﬂight environment remains largely unexplored.
Previous studies of antibiotic resistance in microgravity have
focused mainly on transient physiologic changes leading to
increased or decreased antibiotic susceptibility (Tixador et al.,

1985, 1994; Lapchine et al., 1986; Klaus and Howard, 2006). In
contrast, the experiments reported here address the heritable
emergence of antibiotic resistance in a microbe exposed to
spaceﬂight stress resulting from mutations in genes encoding an
important antibiotic target, RNA polymerase.
Cell Numbers Achieved during
Spaceﬂight
Experiments have been conducted in which the growth of
various bacterial species, cultivated under otherwise-matching
conditions of hardware, media, inoculation, etc., has been
compared in spaceﬂight vs. GCs. A number of these studies have
shown increased ﬁnal cell density during spaceﬂight, while others
have not observed signiﬁcant diﬀerences between spaceﬂight and
1 xg conditions (reviewed in Benoit and Klaus, 2007; Horneck
et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2014).
Attempts have been made to explain the phenomenon of
bacterial growth to diﬀerent densities in spaceﬂight vs. GCs.
Benoit and Klaus (2007) suggested that microgravity abolishes
convective mixing in liquid culture and that for some unknown
reason non-motile cells grow better under these non-mixing
conditions (Benoit and Klaus, 2007). According to their model,
the movement of motile cells was proposed to mix the liquid
medium, thus negating the lack of convective mixing in
microgravity and leading to equal growth of motile cells in
microgravity and 1 xg (Benoit and Klaus, 2007). However,
Kim et al. (2013) recently explored the role of phosphate
and/or oxygen availability, carbon source, and motility on
the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in spaceﬂight
vs. GCs. They found that the carbon source used (citrate
vs. glucose) did not result in signiﬁcantly diﬀerent growth
in space vs. ground, but that cultivation under phosphate
or oxygen limitation led to increased growth in spaceﬂight;
furthermore, increasing phosphate concentration or aeration
resulted in equal growth of cells in space vs. GCs (Kim
et al., 2013). In addition, the eﬀect of motility was tested by
comparing the growth of the wild-type P. aeruginosa strain with
a non-motile mutant harboring a deletion in the motABCD
genes encoding the ﬂagellar motor proteins. No signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in growth of the strains in space vs. ground was
found, failing to support the “motility” hypothesis (Kim et al.,
2013). The authors concluded that growth of P. aeruginosa to
higher density in spaceﬂight was largely determined by oxygen
and/or phosphate limitation, i.e., culture conditions (Kim et al.,
2013).
In the experiments described here, we observed that
S. epidermidis cells grew to signiﬁcantly lower densities in FL
samples than in GC samples. To the best of our knowledge,
bacterial growth to a lower ﬁnal concentration in spaceﬂight
vs. GC samples has not been reported. The reason for this
observation is not known, but our results also do not support the
“motility” hypothesis, as S. epidermidis is a non-motile bacterium
and grew to lower cell density in FL vs. GC samples, not higher

Spontaneous rpoB Mutations in Spaceﬂight
as would be predicted. It is unlikely that availability of nutrients
was limiting in these experiments, as the medium used (TSY
containing 10% glycerol) is a rich medium. However, diﬀerences
in diﬀusion of oxygen/CO2, nutrients, and/or potentially toxic
end products in FL vs. GC cultures cannot be ruled out (see
Possible Mechanisms).
Frequency and Spectra of Mutations to
RifR in FL vs. GC Samples
Few experiments have been performed to measure both the
frequency and spectra of mutations in the same gene of microbes
exposed to spaceﬂight in comparison to GCs, and none using
S. epidermidis. In an earlier spaceﬂight experiment on space
station Mir, it was noted that the frequency of mutation to
streptomycin resistance (StrR) by B. subtilis spores was not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between FL vs. GC samples, but that the
spectrum of StrR mutations in the rpsL gene was found to
diﬀer substantially (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the experiments
reported here, we observed that S. epidermidis cells behaved
somewhat diﬀerently, in that they both mutated to RifR with a
signiﬁcantly (24-fold) higher frequency in FL samples than in
GC samples, and also displayed diﬀerences in their spectra of
rpoB mutations. Although direct comparison between these two
experiments (each using diﬀerent organisms, growth conditions,
and target genes) would be risky, the common ﬁnding of altered
mutational spectra in both cases is intriguing and warrants
further testing.
Comparison of Simulated Microgravity
vs. Spaceﬂight
Opportunities for true spaceﬂight experiments are very limited,
and it is impossible on the Earth’s surface to generate
a true microgravity environment. In response, investigators
have turned to a number of ground-based systems that
have been designed to simulate the eﬀects of microgravity
(reviewed in Anken, 2013). Among these, clinostats utilizing
the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system have become widely
used as spaceﬂight culture analogs (Nickerson et al., 2003;
Anken, 2013). In some cases, alterations in bacterial gene
expression and virulence have been found to correlate well
between
clinorotation
and
actual
spaceﬂight
experiments,
but not in other cases (reviewed in Rosenzweig et al.,
2014).
In a previous communication, we measured growth and
mutation frequency to RifR in S. epidermidis cells grown in
RWVs (Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2014). In the RWV system,
cultures of S. epidermidis grew to signiﬁcantly higher titers in
the vertical (i.e., simulated microgravity) orientation than in
the horizontal (i.e., 1 xg) orientation (Fajardo-Cavazos et al.,
2014). In stark contrast, in the present study, we found that
S. epidermidis cells grew to signiﬁcantly lower titers in space. We
found further discordance when the frequency of mutation to
RifR was compared between the spaceﬂight and RWV studies.
In the present study, S. epidermidis FL cultures showed a
highly signiﬁcant increase in mutation to RifR than did GC
samples, but in the RWV study, there was no statistical diﬀerence
in mutation frequencies to RifR in vertical vs. horizontal
RWVs (Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2014). These results lead us to
conclude that in the S. epidermidis model system described
here, RWV experiments are of little value in predicting or
modeling the behavior of this organism under spaceﬂight
conditions.
Possible Mechanisms
How does cultivation in spaceﬂight change the frequency and
spectrum of rpoB mutations conferring RifR to S. epidermidis?
In the experiments reported here, cells were exposed as
nearly
as
possible
to
matched
conditions
of
hardware,
temperature, growth medium, incubation time, and times
in stasis both before growth (as air-dried ﬁlms) and after
growth (frozen at −80◦C). The two major factors prevailing
in spaceﬂight are decreased gravity and increased ionizing
radiation.
In orbit, objects inside or attached to the ISS are in free-
fall such that the apparent gravitational force they experience
is very small (around 1 µg). Microgravity aﬀects a bacterial
culture in a number of ways, for example: (i) buoyancy or
sedimentation of cells is eﬀectively negated; (ii) the rate of heat
and mass transfer via passive convection becomes negligible,
and in fact transfer of heat, nutrients, and waste toxins in a
static culture becomes dominated by the rate of diﬀusion; and
(iii) liquid behavior at solid surfaces and air–water interfaces is
altered in microgravity, as surface tension, viscosity, capillary
action, and wetting are removed from gravitational inﬂuence
(Rosenzweig et al., 2014). The net result is that the same cells
cultivated in matched hardware, medium, etc., in FL vs. GC
could in fact be residing in two very diﬀerent environments.
Often, an increase in mutation rate can be a response to
environmental stress (Galhardo et al., 2007), suggesting that cells
in FL samples might be experiencing stress. One way of testing
this hypothesis would be to measure global gene expression by
performing whole-transcriptome, -proteome, and -metabolome
analyses on FL vs. GC cultures, experiments which are currently
in progress.
At the altitude of ISS orbit (∼400 km), the interior of the
vehicle is exposed to ionizing radiation consisting mostly of
high-energy photons and atomic nuclei (Anonymous, 2002). The
S. epidermidis FL samples inhabited the ISS interior for 30 days.
Ongoing dosimetry indicates that the dose rate of ionizing
radiation inside the ISS during this period amounted to ∼13–
14 mGy, compared to the global average background radiation
dose on Earth of ∼0.25 mGy during the same period (Puchalska
et al., 2014). This dose is likely an overestimate for the FL
samples, as they were also stored within lockers, inside aluminum
BRIC canisters and aluminum-and-epoxy PDFUs. Nevertheless,
FL samples were almost certainly exposed to a higher ionizing
radiation dose than their GC counterparts. In support of the
notion that FL samples may have received ionizing radiation hits,
we observed two double mutations in rpoB from FL but not from
GC samples; interestingly, induction of multiple closely linked
mutations are a hallmark of ionizing radiation (Eccles et al.,
2011).

Spontaneous rpoB Mutations in Spaceﬂight
Broader Implications of the Results
In
this
communication,
we
report
that
cultivation
of
S. epidermidis in the human spaceﬂight environment of the ISS
led to (i) an increase in the mutation frequency to RifR and
(ii) alterations in the spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene
which result in RifR. The results reported here with S. epidermidis
appear to support previous results obtained using B. subtilis on
space station Mir (Yatagai et al., 2000), and lead us to propose
that exposure of bacteria to the human spaceﬂight environment
can result in an alteration of the location of mutational hotspots
within the target genes encoding antibiotic resistance factors.
Further experiments using a greater variety of microorganisms
will be needed to test this hypothesis.
The target gene used in this study, rpoB, encodes the β subunit
of the enzyme RNA polymerase, a multisubunit enzyme which
makes contacts with every transcribed gene in the bacterial
genome. We and others have previously shown that single
point mutations in rpoB leading to RifR can profoundly alter
the global pattern of gene expression in bacteria and lead to
(i) changes in growth, transformation, sporulation and spore
resistance properties (Maughan et al., 2004; Moeller et al., 2012);
(ii) activation of otherwise cryptic phenotypes (Perkins and
Nicholson, 2008); and (iii) artiﬁcial triggering of the stringent
response (reviewed in Alifano et al., 2015). It will be important
to determine how the novel mutational changes in rpoB reported
in this communication aﬀect the physiological properties of the
resulting mutants, such as their: growth and survival properties
on environmental surfaces and in the host; communicability;
pathogenic potential; and resistance to multiple antibiotics.
Management of microbial antibiotic resistance in conﬁned
environments on Earth, such as hospitals, prisons, military
barracks, nursing homes, etc. has proven diﬃcult. The results
reported here suggest that our Earth-based understanding of the
emergence of antibiotic resistance may not be wholly applicable
to the human spaceﬂight environment. Research into the
biology of spaceﬂight has uncovered alterations in crewmember
immune function, microbial diversity, and in altered regulation
of microbial physiologic responses, leading in some cases to
increased virulence and antibiotic resistance (reviewed in Ott
et al., 2012). In addition to the above factors, elucidation
of the spaceﬂight-speciﬁc genetic mechanisms leading to the
emergence of antibiotic resistance is needed to inform mitigation
strategies for crew health and mission success. As more humans
embark on longer sojourns into space, the more important these
considerations will become.
