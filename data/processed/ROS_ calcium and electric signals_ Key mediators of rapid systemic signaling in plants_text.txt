Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are essential for plant survival during episodes of environmental
stress. Recent studies highlighted a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in mediating systemic responses
and SAA during light stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These studies further identiﬁed the RESPIRATORY BURST
OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein as a key player in mediating rapid systemic ROS responses. Here, we report that
tissue-speciﬁc expression of RBOHD in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells of the rbohD mutant restores systemic ROS
signaling, systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of light stress. We further
demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF are both required for local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of
Arabidopsis. Taken together, our ﬁndings highlight a key role for RBOHD-driven ROS production at the vascular bundles of
Arabidopsis in mediating light stress–induced systemic signaling and SAA. In addition, they suggest that the integration
of ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic signals, during systemic signaling, occurs at the vascular bundles.
INTRODUCTION
Plants and other multicellular organisms are able to transmit
different chemical and physical signals over long distances,
sometimes traversing their entire length. These signals coordinate
theresponseoftheentireorganismtodifferentstresses, pathogens,
and/or other stimuli and are thought to play a key role in the accli-
mation, defense, and adaptation of different organisms to their
environment (Choi et al., 2017; Takahashi et al., 2018; Kollist et al.,
2019; Wang et al., 2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). In plants,
a plethora of chemical and physical signals are transmitted from
a single leaf or root tip subjected to stress (i.e., a local tissue) to the
entireplant(i.e.,systemictissues).Thesesignals,collectivelytermed
systemic signals, include different chemicals and volatiles, such as
salicylic acid, abscisic acid (ABA), and methyl jasmonate, as well as
small peptides, and physical signals such as electric signals and
hydraulic waves(Galvez-Valdivieso etal., 2009; Szechy´nska-Hebda
et al., 2010; Devireddy et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al.,
2018;Takahashietal.,2018;Wangetal.,2019).Inrecentyears,arole
for two interlinked signal transduction molecules, that is, Ca21 and
reactive oxygen species (ROS), was identiﬁed in the systemic re-
sponse of plants to different abiotic stimuli such as excess light
stress or wounding. These two signals were further shown to
propagate from cell to cell over long distances in plants and were
termedtheCa21andROSwaves(Milleretal.,2009;Choietal.,2014;
Toyota et al., 2018; Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018; Fichman et al.,
2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020).
The ROS wave is essential for coordinating systemic metabolic
responses that generate different metabolic signatures in different
parts of the plant (Choudhury et al., 2018); for coordinating sys-
temic transcriptomic responses that activate transcriptional
networks essential for plant acclimation (Zandalinas et al., 2019);
and for coordinating systemic physiological responses, such as
changes in stomatal aperture (Devireddy et al., 2018, 2020). In
addition, the ROS wave is required for successful plant accli-
mation to light and heat stresses (Suzuki et al., 2013; Devireddy
et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al., 2019, 2020). The initiation, propa-
gation, and maintenance of the ROS wave in response to abiotic
stress is dependent on the plasma membrane–localized RE-
SPIRATORYBURSTOXIDASEHOMOLOGD(RBOHD;AT5G47910)
protein (Miller et al., 2009; Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018; Fichman
and Mittler, 2020). However, genetic evidence in the form of
complementation studies, as well as cell biology studies eluci-
dating the role of RBOHD in different plant tissues during systemic
signaling, has thus far been lacking. RBOHD belongs to a family of
10 different proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), able to
produce superoxide radicals at the apoplast in response to
a cytosolic calcium and/or phosphorylation signal (Suzuki et al.,
2011; Kadota et al., 2015; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). The su-
peroxide radicals generated at the apoplast by RBOH proteins are
dismutated spontaneously, or via superoxide dismutases present
in the apoplast, to generate H2O2 that can enter cells via aqua-
porins (Mittler et al., 2011; Gilroy et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017;
Mittler, 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2017; Clemente-Moreno et al.,
2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020; García et al., 2020). Of the 10

RBOHs in Arabidopsis, RBOHD and RBOHF (AT1G64060) are the
two primarily expressed in aboveground vegetative tissues (Torres
et al., 2002; Kwak et al., 2003; Morales et al., 2016).
Based on their relative speed, as well as their physical and
chemical properties, four different systemic signals are thought to
copropagate, or at least interact with each other, during rapid
systemic signaling in plants. These include the ROS, Ca21, hy-
draulic, and electric waves (Mittler et al., 2011; Gilroy et al., 2016;
Choi et al., 2017; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Calcium waves and
electrical signals are dependent on the function of the calcium-
permeable glutamate receptor-like (GLR) GLR3.3 and GLR3.6
channels (Mousavi et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al.,
2018; Wudick et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020), and calcium and ROS
waves were proposed to be linked through the function of RBOHD
(Mittler et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2016). RBOHD was further shown
to be required for the propagation of certain electric signals in
response to light stress (Suzuki et al., 2013). Although it is un-
known how hydraulic waves are linked to electric, ROS, and
calcium waves, it was proposed that different mechanosensitive
channels (Basu and Haswell, 2017) could sense hydraulic waves
at systemic tissues and convert them into calcium signals (Choi
et al., 2017; Kollist et al., 2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Cal-
cium signals can further inﬂuence ROS signals via the function of
different calcium binding proteins and kinases/phosphatase
molecular switches or by directly binding to the E and F helices
(EF)-hand domains of RBOHD (Suzuki et al., 2011; Kadota et al.,
2015; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Although the Ca21, hydraulic,
and electric waves were recently shown to propagate through the
vascular bundles of plants, utilizing plant tissues such as phloem,
xylem parenchyma, and bundle sheath cells (Mousavi et al., 2013;
Sade et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Shao
et al., 2020), the cell types and tissues through which the ROS
wave propagates in plants are currently unknown (Fichman and
Mittler, 2020; Fichman et al., 2020).
RESULTS
Complementation of Systemic ROS Signaling in the rbohD
Mutant with RBOHD Driven by Different
Tissue-Speciﬁc Promoters
The RBOHD protein is expressed in almost all tissues of Arabi-
dopsis, including epidermis, mesophyll, stomata, and vascular
bundles (Hao et al., 2014; Morales et al., 2016). To determine in
what tissues its expression is vital for systemic ROS signaling in
response to a local treatment of excess high-light (HL) stress,
we attempted to complement the rbohD mutant with different
binary vectors driving the stable expression of RBOHD using its
native promoter or different tissue-speciﬁc promoters (Figure 1;
Supplemental Figures 1 and 2; Supplemental Table 1). The tissue-
speciﬁcpromoterschosenforouranalysisweresuccessfullyused
in previous studies to drive the expression of different proteins in
their corresponding tissues (Funk et al., 2002; Hooker et al., 2002;
Yoshimoto et al., 2003; Endo et al., 2007; Avci et al., 2008;
Mustroph et al., 2009; Dhondt et al., 2010; Sawa and Kay, 2011;
Cui et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Matías-Hernández et al., 2016). In
addition, to conﬁrm that the RBOHD protein, expressed under the
control of the different tissue-speciﬁc promoters (Supplemental
Table 1), accumulates in these tissues, we generated a second set
of transgenic plants in which the RBOHD protein was tagged with
the green ﬂuorescence protein (GFP) at its N terminus, and we
determined that the GFP signal was present in the correct tissues
associated with the different tissue-speciﬁc promoters (Supplemental
Figure1;notusedinFigures1to3).Toimageexcesslightstress–driven

ROS imaging technique we recently developed that is based on the
oxidation of dichloroﬂuorescein (DCF), fumigated as an 29,79-di-
chloroﬂuorescein (H2DCFDA) dye, into plants prior to the stress
treatment (Fichman et al., 2019; Zandalinas et al., 2020).

restored light stress–induced local and systemic ROS responses
(evidentbyaccumulationofoxidizedDCF;Figure1;Fichmanetal.,
2019). By contrast, complementation of RBOHD expression using
an epidermis-speciﬁc promoter (CER6; Hooker et al., 2002;
Mustrophetal.,2009)ormesophyll-speciﬁcpromoter(CAB3;Endo
et al., 2007; Matías-Hernández et al., 2016) only partially restored
light stress–induced local and systemic ROS responses, whereas
complementation of RBOHD expression using a bundle sheath–
speciﬁcpromoter(SCR;Dhondtetal.,2010;Cuietal.,2014)failedto
restore light stress–driven ROS responses (Figure 1). Comple-
mentation of local and systemic ROS responses to the wild-type
levels (evident by accumulation of oxidized DCF) was however
achieved using a xylem parenchyma–speciﬁc promoter (XCP1; Funk
et al., 2002; Avci et al., 2008) or phloem-speciﬁc promoter (Sultr1;3;
Yoshimoto et al., 2003; Sawa and Kay, 2011; Figure 1; Supplemental
Figure2).TheresultspresentedinFigure1andSupplementalFigures
1 and 2 demonstrate that RBOHD expression in the xylem paren-
chyma or phloem isessential for systemic ROS signaling in response
to a local treatment of excess light stress. Restoring whole-leaf
systemic ROS responses via expression of RBOHD in such a lim-
ited number of cells of the rbohD mutant (evident by accumulation of
oxidized DCF; Figure 1; Supplemental Figures 1 and 2) further
suggests that, under the conditions studied in Figure 1, other ROS-
producing mechanisms might be involved in generating ROS in
systemic tissues. These could include RBOHF or other apoplastic
oxidasesand/orcytosolic,mitochondrial,peroxisomal,orchloroplastic
ROS-producing mechanisms (Mittler, 2017; Kollist et al., 2019).
Complementation of Local and Systemic Zat12 Expression
in the rbohD Mutant with RBOHD Driven by Different
Tissue-Speciﬁc Promoters
To determine whether the complementation of systemic ROS sig-
naling in the rbohD mutant also restored systemic transcript ex-
pression in response to excess light stress, we determined the
expression of the ZAT12 gene (AT5G59820) in local and systemic
tissues of the different control and complemented lines using the
ZAT12 promoter:luciferase reporter. The zinc ﬁnger protein ZAT12
was initially identiﬁed as a central regulator essential for light stress
responses and acclimation in Arabidopsis (Iida et al., 2000). Further
studies determined that ZAT12 plays an important role in the re-
sponse of plants to many other abiotic stresses (Davletova et al.,
2005). As shown in Figure 2, compared to the wild type, the systemic
expression of ZAT12 in response to local application of HL stress,
detected under the same experimental conditions used to visualize
the ROS wave in Figure 1, was suppressed in the rbohD mutant. By
contrast, local expression of ZAT12 was not. This ﬁnding demon-
strated that ZAT12 expression is triggered in local tissues in-
dependent of RBOHD. By contrast, the systemic expression of
ZAT12wasdependentonRBOHDduringsystemicresponsestolight
stress. Similar to our ﬁndings with systemic ROS signaling in the
different RBOHD tissue-speciﬁc complementation lines (Figure 1;
Supplemental Figure 2), light stress–induced systemic expression of
Zat12 could be restored to the wild-type levels only upon expression
of RBOHD in the rbohD mutant using its own native promoter or the
xylem parenchyma– or phloem-speciﬁc promoters (Figure 2). The
results presented in Figure 2 demonstrate that RBOHD expression in
thexylemparenchymaorphloemisessential forsystemictranscript
expression of the key light stress–response gene ZAT12 during the
systemic response of Arabidopsis to a local treatment of HL stress.
Complementation of SAA in the rbohD Mutant with RBOHD
Driven by Different Tissue-Speciﬁc Promoters
The rbohD mutant is unable to acclimate its systemic tissues to light
stressfollowingalocaltreatmentofHLstressappliedtoasingle(local)
leaf (Suzuki et al., 2013; Devireddy et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al.,
2019). Because RBOHD expression in the xylem parenchyma or
phloem cells restored systemic ROS signaling and systemic ex-
pressionofZAT12intherbohDmutant(Figures1and2;Supplemental
Figure2),itcouldpotentiallyrestoreSAAfollowinglocalapplicationof
HL stress. We therefore tested all complemented lines described in
Figure 1 for SAA following a local HL stress treatment. For this
purpose, we used an SAA assay based on measuring excess light
stress–induced systemic leaf injury in the presence or absence of
a short light stress pretreatment applied to a single local leaf (Suzuki
et al., 2013; Devireddy et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al., 2019, 2020). As
shown in Figure 3, complementing the rbohD mutant with RBOHD
expressed via its native promoter, or the xylem parenchyma- or
phloem-speciﬁc promoters, restored HL stress–driven SAA to the
rbohD mutant. By contrast, complementing RBOHD expression in
the rbohD mutant using the epidermis-, mesophyll-, or bundle
sheath–speciﬁc promoters failed to restore SAA to light stress
(Figure 3). The results presented in Figures 1 to 3 reveal that ex-
pression ofRBOHD atthe xylem parenchyma or phloem cellsof the
rbohD mutant is sufﬁcient to restore systemic ROS signaling,
Figure 3. Complementation of Light Stress–Induced SAA in the rbohD
Mutant with RBOHD Driven by Different Tissue-Speciﬁc Promoters.
Light stress–induced systemic leaf cell injury (measured as electrolyte
leakage) of the wild type (Columbia-0 [Col]), rbohD, and the different rbohD
complemented Arabidopsis plants was determined. Systemic leaves were
either untreated, nonpretreated, and unstressed (untreated, unstressed) or
subjected to light stress following a pretreatment of one local leaf with light
stress (pretreated, stressed). SAA is evident by a low level of electrolyte
leakage in light-stressed systemic leaves (pretreated, stressed), which is
similar to that of untreated and unstressed leaves (untreated, unstressed).
Ten different plants each from two independent complemented lines for
each construct (nos. 1 and 2) were subjected to light stress, and cell injury
was measured in systemic leaves by electrolyte leakage. Student’s t test,

expression of the ZAT12 light stress–response regulator, and SAA,
to the rbohD mutant. Taken together, these ﬁndings underscore
a key role for RBOHD, present at the vascular tissues (phloem or
xylem parenchyma) of Arabidopsis, in mediating the systemic re-
sponse of plants to light stress.
BecausetheexpressionofRBOHDinsuchalimitedsubsetofcells
had such a dramatic effect on systemic ROS signaling, transcript
expression and SAA (Figures 1 to 3; Supplemental Figure 2), other
ROS-producing mechanisms might be required for mediating ROS
accumulation in many of the other plant cells that do not express
RBOHD in the rbohD mutant. Potential clues to the existence of such
additional players in the systemic ROS signaling response of Ara-
bidopsis to light stress include our current and previous ﬁndings that
lowlevelsofsystemicROS(evidentbyaccumulationofoxidizedDCF)
can still be detected in the rbohD mutant (Figure 1; Fichman et al.,
2019). Assuggested above, one potential candidate for this function,
based on its expression pattern and function (Torres et al., 2002;
Kwak et al., 2003; Morales et al., 2016), is RBOHF.
RBOHD and RBOHF Are Both Required for Mediating
Systemic ROS Signaling in Response to a Local HL
Stress Treatment
To test whether RBOHF is also required for systemic ROS sig-
naling during the responseof Arabidopsis plantsto lightstress, we
subjected the wild type, rbohD, rbohF, and rbohD rbohF double
mutants (Torres et al., 2002; Kwak et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2009) to
a local HL stress treatment and imaged local and systemic ROS
levels (evident by accumulation of oxidized DCF) in these plants.
As shown in Figure 4, rbohD, rbohF, and rbohD rbohF were all
deﬁcient in systemic ROS signaling in response to a local appli-
cation of excess light stress. Interestingly, the low residual ROS
levels, detected in the rbohD mutant (evident by accumulation of
oxidizedDCF;Figure1;Fichmanetal.,2019),canalsobedetected
in the rbohF mutant (albeit weaker). By contrast, no residual ROS
levels were detected in the rbohD rbohF double mutant (Figure 4).
Fluorescence microscopy imaging of ROS levels (evident by DCF
oxidation), conducted on petioles of local and systemic leaves of
the different mutants following local application of light stress
(Figure 5), revealed that low levels of ROS could be found at the
vascular bundles of the rbohD or rbohF mutants at the local or
systemic tissues in response to light stress. By contrast, ROS
levels were undetected by ﬂuorescence microscopy at the
vascular bundles of local or systemic leaves of the rbohD rbohF
double mutant (Figure 5). Although excess light-driven ROS was
primarily detected at the vascular tissues of local and systemic
leaves of the wild-type plants, in local leaves high ROS levels
were also detected at other cell layers, such as the epidermis
(Figure 5). While the detection of ROS at the epidermis was
evident in the wild type and the rbohF mutant, similar levels were

notdetectedintherbohDor therbohD rbohF doublemutant.The
ﬁndings presented in Figures 4 and 5 support a model in which
RBOHD and RBOHF cooperate to drive local and systemic ROS
signaling (evident by DCF oxidation) at the vascular bundles of
Arabidopsis during light stress and indicate that RBOHD might
also control ROS levels at the epidermis of local leaves. Because
the lack of RBOHD was sufﬁcient to block the spread of
a systemic ROS wave response from the local to the systemic
leaves, even when H2O2 was directly applied to the local leaf
(Supplemental Figure 3A), the suppressed systemic response of
the rbohD or the rbohD rbohF double mutants may not simply
result from the lack of ROS responses at the local tissue.
Systemic ROS signaling may therefore require RBOHD ex-
pression at the local, as well as systemic tissues (Suzuki et al.,
2013). Future studies using the different tissue-speciﬁc pro-
moters (Figures 1 to 3; Supplemental Figure 2) to drive RBOHF
expression in different tissues of the rbohF mutant are likely to
sharpen our understanding of RBOHF function in mediating the
ROS wave. Nonetheless, such studies are not likely to alter the
key ﬁndings of this study revealing that expression of RBOHD in
phloem and xylem parenchyma cells is required for transmitting
the ROS wave during the systemic response of Arabidopsis to
light stress.
DISCUSSION
A perpetual cell-to-cell process of ROS-induced ROS production,
that is, the ROS wave, propagates from a local tissue subjected to
stress to the entire plant and is required for the induction of dif-
ferent acclimation transcripts, metabolites, and physiological
responses in systemic tissues that results in SAA of systemic
tissues to stress (Miller et al., 2009; Mittler et al., 2011; Choudhury
et al., 2018; Devireddy et al., 2018, 2020; Kollist et al., 2019;
Zandalinas et al., 2019, 2020; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). This
process was originally found to depend on a single protein,
RBOHD (Miller et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019). The ROS wave
results in enhanced ROS production in almost all cells of the plant
(Fichman et al., 2019), and this pattern is in agreement with the
tissue-speciﬁc expression map of RBOHD (Hao et al., 2014;
Morales et al., 2016), suggesting that RBOHD in all plant tissues is
involved in ROS production during this process. However, our
current ﬁndings that restoring RBOHD expression solely in the

xylem parenchyma or phloem cells of the rbohD mutant is sufﬁ-
cient to restore systemic whole-plant ROS signaling (Figure 1;
Supplemental Figure 2) strongly suggest that other ROS-
producing pathways and mechanisms might be involved in this
response. Indeed, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, RBOHF that is
present in the rbohD mutant is also required for this response.
Although the expression pattern of RBOHF is not identical to that
of RBOHD, it still covers almost all aboveground plant tissues
(Morales et al., 2016). It is therefore possible that, at least at the
vascular bundles or veins of Arabidopsis, RBOHD and RBOHF
cooperate in driving whole-plant ROS production during the
systemic response to a local application of light stress. In the
absence of one of them, ROS do not accumulate to high enough
levels to trigger a whole-plant ROS signaling response (Figures 4
and 5), while in the presence of both, the ROS wave that prop-
agates through the vascular bundles of plants can trigger a whole-
plant ROS signaling response that results in the induction of
systemic stress-response transcript accumulation and SAA
(Figures 1 to 5). Of course, other ROS-producing mechanisms
such as apoplastic oxidases and/or cytosolic, mitochondrial,
peroxisomal, or chloroplastic ROS-producing mechanisms
(Mittler, 2017; Kollist et al., 2019) could also participate in this
process. RBOH-dependent ROS production in response to light
stress was recently reported in bundle sheath strands of rice
(Oryza sativa; Xiong et al., 2020), further supporting our ﬁndings
that ROS-mediated signaling at the vascular bundles or veins of
plants plays a key role in systemic responses to light stress
(Figures 1 to 5).
The ﬁndings that restoring RBOHD expression in the xylem
parenchyma or phloem is sufﬁcient to restore whole-plant sys-
temic ROS signaling further suggestthat RBOHDfunction inthese
twocelltypesiscomplementary. Interestingly,thefunctionofboth
GLR proteins GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 was previously shown to be
required for the propagation of electric signals, the calcium wave,
and potentially some ROS signal, but GLR3.3 is expressed in
phloem cells, and GLR3.6 in xylem parenchyma cells (Mousavi
et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Wang et al.,
2019; Lew et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2020). Taken together, our
results could suggest an interesting scenario in which RBOHD
and/or RBOHF function is required for the coupling of the ROS,
calcium, and electric waves (Choi et al., 2017; Fichman and
Mittler, 2020) in at least one of these tissues, or both, func-
tioning together with either GLR3.3 and/or GLR3.6 (Fichman
et al., 2020). In support of a link between the ROS wave and
electric signals are also our previous ﬁndings that the propa-
gation of certain types of electric signals is suppressed in the
rbohD mutant (Suzuki et al., 2013). Because hydraulic waves
are also thought to propagate through the vascular bundles
(Sade et al., 2014; Gilroy et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Fichman
and Mittler, 2020), our ﬁndings that RBOHD expression in xylem
parenchyma or phloem is sufﬁcient to restore whole-plant
systemic ROS signaling could further suggest that the ROS,
calcium, electric, and hydraulic waves are all integrated in these
tissues.
A key role for bundle sheath cells in mediating excess light
stress–induced systemic responses was previously reported in
Arabidopsis, highlighting veins as important hubs for ABA and
ROS signaling (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009; Kangasjärvi et al.,
2009; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). In support of this role, as well as
the ﬁndings described in our current study (Figures 1 to 5), are our
previous ﬁndings that systemic stomatal aperture closure re-
sponses occur faster the closer stomata are to leaf veins
(Devireddy et al., 2020). The expression of RBOHD in vascular
bundles may therefore drive ROS signaling in these cells, af-
fecting the stomata closest to them ﬁrst, during the systemic
response to light stress (Devireddy et al., 2020). This spatial
relationship could further be explained by an interaction be-
tween ABA signaling and ROS production occurring at the
vascular bundles (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009; Kangasjärvi
et al., 2009; Devireddy et al., 2018, 2020). Interestingly, al-
though bundle sheath cells were shown to play a key role in
systemic ABA and ROS signaling in response to abiotic stress
(Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009; Kangasjärvi et al., 2009), they
were not found by our analysis to be essential for mediating the
systemic ROS wave response (Figures 1 to 3). This ﬁnding could
suggest that the role of bundle sheath cells in mediating sys-
temic signaling is linked in Arabidopsis to that of phloem and/or
xylem parenchyma cells and that these different cell layers
could cooperate in the systemic response of plants to stress.
Phloem and/or xylem parenchyma cells could therefore me-
diate the ROS wave, while bundle sheath cells could integrate it
with ABA signaling.
Taken together, our ﬁndings reveal that in addition to Ca21,
electric, and hydraulic signals (Mousavi et al., 2013; Sade
et al., 2014; Toyota et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020), ROS signals
are also mediated through the plant vascular system. The
potential integration of all these rapid systemic signals (Gilroy
et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Fichman and Mittler, 2020;
Fichman et al., 2020) could therefore occur at the vascular
bundles of plants, underscoring the importance of these tis-
sues in mediating plant acclimation to different abiotic
stresses and other stimuli. Vascular bundles could therefore
serve as the central rapid systemic signaling super highway of
plants.
METHODS
Plant Material, Growth Conditions, and Constructs
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana cv Columbia-0), rbohD, rbohF, and
rbohD rbohF plants (conﬁrmed transposon insertion mutants; Torres et al.,
2002; Kwak et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2009) were grown in peat pellets (Jiffy-
7, Jiffy; http://www.jiffygroup.com/) at 23°C under short-day growth
conditions (10-h-light/14-h-dark cycle, 50 mmol m22 s21; Supplemental
Figure 4). For complementing the rbohD mutant, promoter fragments
representing between 579 to 3000 bp upstream to the 59 of the start codon
of CER6 (AT1G68530; Hooker et al., 2002; Mustroph et al., 2009), CAB3
(AT1G29910; Endo et al., 2007; Matías-Hernández et al., 2016), SCR
(AT3G54220; Dhondt et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2014), XCP1 (AT4G35350;
Funk et al., 2002; Avci et al., 2008), Sultr1;3 (AT1G22150; Yoshimoto et al.,
2003; Sawa and Kay, 2011), and RBOHD (AT5G47910; Supplemental
Table 1; Torres et al., 2002) were isolated by PCR from genomic DNA,
sequenced, ligated upstream to the RBOHD gene, and cloned into
pCAMBIA2301 vectors. Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 was trans-
formed with all constructs and used to generate transgenic homozygous
rbohD plants. Transgenic homozygous rbohD plants expressing the lu-
ciferase reporter under the control of the Zat12 promoter were obtained as

previously described by Miller et al. (2009) and complemented with the
different vectors for RBOHD expression as described above. A third set of
vectors for expressing RBOHD fused in frame to GFP (N-terminal fusion)
under the control of the different promoters described above were also
generated and characterized. Homozygous lines were obtained for all
constructs described above, and two to three different homozygous lines
were used for all GFP localization, ROS imaging, transcript expression
analyses using luciferase imaging, and SAA, as described below. At least
two different independent homozygous lines were used for each assay and
at least 10 different individual plants from each line were analyzed and
averaged (for a total of at least 20 different plants per time point per
treatment).
Light Stress, ROS, Luciferase and GFP Imaging, and Data Analysis
To image whole-plant ROS levels, plants were fumigated with 50 mM
H2DCFDA (excitation/emission, 495 nm/517 nm; Millipore-Sigma; Ortega-
Villasante et al., 2018) in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing
0.01% (v/v) Silwet L-77 (LEHLE seeds) using a portable mini nebulizer
(Punasi Direct) for 30 min as previously described by Fichman et al. (2019)
and Zandalinas et al. (2020). As a control for dye penetration, plants were
fumigated with 50 mM H2DCFDA for 30 min, followed by fumigation with H2
O2 as previously described in Supplemental Figures 3B and 3C, and by
Fichman et al. (2019) and Zandalinas et al. (2020). In addition, plants were
fumigated with 50 mM H2DCFDA for 30 min and then with 10 mM ascorbic
acid or 5 mM glutathione for 10 min and then with 1 mM H2O2 for 5 min
(Supplemental Figures 3B and 3C). For luciferase imaging, plants were
sprayed with 1 mM luciferin (sodium salt; GOLD BioTechnology) solution
accordingtoMilleretal.(2009).FollowingH2DCFDAorluciferinapplication,
localleaveswereexposed toalightintensityof1700mmolm22s21for2min
using a ColdVision ﬁber optic light-emitting diode light source (Schott;
Supplemental Figure 4) as described by Devireddy et al. (2018) and
Zandalinas et al. (2019, 2020). Imaging ROS accumulation (evident by DCF
oxidation) and luciferase activity in response to a local treatment of light
stress was conducted with an IVIS Lumina S5 platform using Living Image
4.7.2 software (PerkinElmer) as described by Miller et al. (2009), Fichman
et al. (2019) and Zandalinas et al. (2020). Because of the relatively young
age of plants used, the activity of luciferase controlled by the ZAT12
promoter was mainly detected at the edge of leaves (Miller et al., 2009;
Fichman et al., 2019). GFP localization and DCF imaging were also per-
formed by Lionheart FX ﬂuorescence (BioTek) and TCS SP8 (Leica) mul-
tiphoton confocal microscopes. All experiments were repeated at least
three times each with the wild type, rbohD, and two to three different
transgenic rbohD complemented lines.
Systemic Acquired Acclimation Assays
A single leaf was pretreated for 15 min with a light intensity of 1700 mmol
m22 s21. Plants were then incubated for 45 min under controlled con-
ditions. Following the recovery period, a systemic leaf was exposed to
alightintensity of1700mmolm22s21for 45min. Systemic leaveswerethen
analyzed for electrolyte leakage as described by Suzuki et al. (2013),
Devireddy et al. (2018), and Zandalinas et al. (2019, 2020). Control plants
wereuntreated (Suzuki etal., 2013;Devireddyet al.,2018; Zandalinasetal.,
2019, 2020).
Statistical Analyses
Results are presented as the mean 6 SD. Statistical analyses were per-
formed by two-tailed Student’s t test (asterisks denote statistical signiﬁ-
cance at P < 0.05 with respect to controls; Supplemental Table 2; Suzuki
et al., 2013; Choudhury et al., 2018; Devireddy et al., 2018; Fichman et al.,
