SUMMARY
Human expansion in space is hampered by the physiological risks of spaceﬂight.
The muscle and the liver are among the most affected tissues during spaceﬂight
and their relationships in response to space exposure have never been studied.
We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on
NASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceﬂight using GSEA, ORA,
and sparse partial least square-differential analysis. We found that lipid meta-
bolism is the most affected biological process between the two organs. A speciﬁc
gene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with glucose
sparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand process
gene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the muscle.
Our results show that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver
and muscle atrophy gene expression are two paired events during spaceﬂight,
for which dietary changes represent a possible countermeasure.
INTRODUCTION
The presence of humans in space has considerably increased since the beginning of space conquest and
the space population is expected to continue to grow with tourism and private research activities. The
NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back to the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is esti-
mated in the course of the 2030s (Bukley, 2020). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more as-
tronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanity’s understanding of the universe
and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live in
space. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The
Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving
force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight most
plausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which anticipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface
ranging from a small-sized crew to colony of thousands of people (Air Force Space Command, 2019). Over
ﬁfty years after the ﬁrst foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetary
species.
This endeavor is hampered by space stressors such as space radiation, microgravity, conﬁnement, isola-
tion, hostile conditions, and distance from Earth, that all induce physiological changes (Afshinnekoo
et al., 2020). These changes can be seen as physiological adaptation to the space environment, but they
can become maladaptive and deleterious over time and upon gravity re-exposure during a planetary
mission such as to Mars. Nine major spaceﬂight systemic and physiological health risks have been identi-
ﬁed: cardiovascular dysregulation, central nervous system impairment, increased cancer risk, muscle
degeneration, bone loss, liver dysfunction and lipid dysregulation, circadian rhythm dysregulation,
immune dysfunction, and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). Mus-
cle atrophy is a major risk for these missions as it impairs mobility, thus compromising critical mission
operations such as post-landing vehicle egress. Muscle atrophy is characterized by unbalanced protein
degradation and the loss of muscle mass. However, protein supplementation fails to counteract muscle
loss in sarcopenia, cachexia, and spaceﬂight-induced muscle atrophy (Gao and Chilibeck, 2020). Many
studies have documented spaceﬂight-induced muscle atrophy as a consequence of weightlessness and
decreased muscle solicitation (Fitts et al., 2000). Daily exercises as countermeasures succeed in slowing

down the process but the muscle still shrinks during missions. Despite the important advances in human
physiology in space, the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological changes are poorly under-
stood. Therefore, molecular analyses are needed to enable a new countermeasure approach to monitor
astronaut health and ensure safety of future habited space missions.
The liver and the muscle are among the most affected tissues during spaceﬂight. The liver and the muscle
are two master organs of the metabolism, with the muscle tissue representing up to 50% of the total body
mass. Consistently, astronauts and living organisms exposed to space environment display many features
of dysregulated metabolism.
Rats on the SpaceLab-2 mission displayed increased serum cholesterol levels (Popova et al., 1999). In
mice, activated lipotoxic pathways are associated with abnormal liver lipid accumulation and increased
lipid metabolism and lipid localization gene expression (Jonscher et al., 2016; Beheshti et al., 2019). Be-
heshti et al. recently showed using a multi-omic analysis that lipid dysregulation in mice liver and lipo-
toxic pathways was a speciﬁc response to space stressors alone (Beheshti et al., 2019). Dysregulated lipid
metabolism, especially lipid accumulation, is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty acid liver dis-
eases (NAFLD), liver dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry
et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). Of note, mice showed early signs of liver injury on a short space ﬂight
(STS-135), and subclinical diabetogenic changes have been shown to occur during spaceﬂight and bed-
rest studies (Jonscher et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2002). In mice ﬂown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, the
transcriptome response of the longissimus dorsi was mainly linked to metabolism, especially insulin
signaling and sensitivity, highlighting the impact of spaceﬂight on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle
(Gambara et al., 2017a). Glucagon and insulin, two hormones of glucose metabolism, were predicted to
be the common upstream regulators of spaceﬂight metabolic shift (Beheshti et al., 2019). In the Twin
Study, increased levels of lactic acid were found in the urine of the ﬂight astronaut, consistent with me-
tabolomics data showing an increased lactic acid/pyruvic acid ratio suggesting a metabolic shift (Garrett-
Bakelman et al., 2019). Interestingly, insulin resistance and liver diseases are associated with muscle at-
rophy and a potential reciprocal inﬂuence of insulin resistance and muscle disuse atrophy (Chakravarthy
et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Rudrappa et al., 2016; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). As such, metabolic
stress is a priority research for human space exploration (Bergouignan et al., 2016). The roles of the liver
and the muscle are often interlinked, and muscle-liver crosstalk are described in metabolic diseases
NAFLD, NASH, IR, and diabetes (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Soeters and Soeters, 2012). However, the rela-
tionship of the two organs in the response to space environment has not been yet elucidated.
In this study, we describe for the ﬁrst time the relationship of the response of both the liver and the muscle
of mice during spaceﬂight using the R software package mixOmics widely used in the omic ﬁeld. The mixO-
mics package enables datasets comparison, correlations, and associations visualization in various research
areas (Duruﬂe´ et al., 2021; Gonza´ lez et al., 2012).
RESULTS
Lipid metabolic processes are the most common biological processes affected in mice
quadriceps and liver during spaceﬂight
Previous studies showed that the muscle and the liver are differentially affected by metabolic changes dur-
ing spaceﬂight (da Silveira et al., 2020). Here, we ﬁrst investigated the commonalities between the two or-
gans. We chose to focus on the quadriceps, which is the most important in term of size and as such poten-
tially in terms of effects.
Transcriptomic data from C57BL/6J mouse liver and quadriceps from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1)
protocol were analyzed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method and visualized with Cyto-
scape software (Figure 1A). In the quadriceps, ‘‘fatty coA process’’ and ‘‘axon extension negative’’ were
the most enriched processes. In the liver, most enriched processes were related to mitochondria (‘‘proton
triphosphate gsea’’, ‘‘electron transport cytochrome’’, and ‘‘mitochondrial translational elongation’’) fol-
lowed by lipid metabolism-related processes (‘‘oxidation fatty acyl’’, ‘‘plasma lipoprotein particle’’, and
‘‘positive lipid process’’) (Figure S1A, Related to Figure 1). Similarly, lipid metabolism-related pathways
were also the most enriched reported by KEGG pathways over representation analysis in the liver (Fig-
ure S1B, Related to Figure 1).

Among the 24,961 transcripts identiﬁed in the liver samples and the 22,657 transcripts in the identiﬁed
quadriceps sample, the most enriched gene ontology biological processes altered by spaceﬂight assessed
by GSEA commonly shared were related to lipid metabolism (Figure 1A). ‘‘b-oxidation lipid’’, ‘‘plasma lipo-
protein particle’’, and ‘‘triglycerides neutral biosynthetic’’ genesets were upregulated in both organs, while
‘‘cholesterol alcohol biosynthetic’’ and ‘‘fatty acyl coa’’ displayed opposed expression patterns between
the two organs. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondria-related process genesets were also among
the most shared processes and were upregulated in the liver, while downregulated in the quadriceps.
Endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome-related process genesets were also among the most shared process
genesets, potentially suggesting impaired protein metabolism.
Both positively (upregulated) and negatively (downregulated) enriched KEGG pathways obtained by GSEA
for each organ were compared together in a Venn diagram (Figures 1B and 1C). Among the 70 pathways
analyzed, 11 pathways were common to the two organs. Again, lipid metabolism-related pathways were
the most represented among the common ones (Figure 1B), with ‘‘KEGG_BIOSYNTHESIS_OF_UNSATUR-
ED_FATTY_ACIDs’’ and the two short chain fatty acid metabolism pathways ‘‘KEGG_BUTANOATE_ME-
TABOLISM’’ and ‘‘KEGG_PROPANOATE_METABOLISM’’ (Figure 1C). Protein metabolism (‘‘KEGG_RIBO-
SOME’’, ‘‘KEGG_PROTEASOME’’, ‘‘KEGG_RNA_POLYMERASE’’) and DNA repair-related pathways were
also among the common downregulated pathways between the two organs. Thus, spaceﬂights induce a
strong transcriptional response of the metabolism, especially for lipid metabolism in the liver and in the
quadriceps.
Hypoglycemic signaling pathways genes are the most signiﬁcantly downregulated in mice
quadriceps during spaceﬂight
In the quadriceps, 972 genes were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed, among which 562 were downregu-
lated and 410 were upregulated. KEGG pathways over representation analysis (ORA) in the online software
Webgesalt reported 30 most enriched pathways (Figure 2A). Pathways involved in metabolism are partic-
ularly enriched, especially those regulating glycemia: HIF1, ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and PI3K-Akt
signaling pathways. Hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression was decreased in ﬂight mice
compared to ground control mice (Figure 2B). Interestingly, glucose transport processes were among
the most negatively enriched in GSEA reports, and glucose transport process gene expression was
decreased in ﬂight mice compared to ground control mice (Figures 2C and 2D).
We investigated the relationships between the downregulation of glucose transport process genes and the
downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathway genes using the supervised method sPLS-DA (sparse
partial least square-differential analysis) with the R-mixOmics package. We compared the reported genes
by the sPLS-DA performed at 100% (22657), 75% (16992), 50% (11328), and 25% (5664) (according to the pro-
cess suggested in Duruﬂe´ et al., 2021) transcript input in a Venn diagram, and we found that 3463 genes
were commonly reported with the strongest importance for discrimination (‘‘discriminating genes’’) (Fig-
ure S2A, Related to Figure 2). KEGG pathways ORA on these speciﬁc genes reported several enriched
pathways among which were the previously mentioned hypoglycemic signaling pathways. Moreover,
491 signiﬁcant differentially expressed genes (DEG) were still present among the 3463 sPLS-DA common
genes, and KEGG pathway ORA on these genes demonstrated fewer enriched pathways than on the orig-
inal analysis of the 972 DEG (Figure 2A) and on the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes (Figure S2A, Related to
Figure 2), but the hypoglycemic ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and HIF-1 signaling pathways were still among
the most enriched (Figure S2B, Related to Figure 2). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that in-
ﬂight mice and ground control mice groups were clearly discriminated by gene variability (Figure S2C,
Related to Figure 2), despite PCA being an unsupervised method. Finally, we found that glucose transport
process and hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression correlate (Figure 2E), and this correlation is
strong as indicated by the correlation intensity level shown on the correlation heatmap (Figure S2D,
Related to Figure 2).
Muscle glucose transport gene expression correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair,
autophagy, and translation processes gene expression
In the quadriceps, DNA repair, autophagy, and translation are among the most enriched processes and
pathways reported by GSEA and ORA. DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process genes are
decreased in inﬂight mice compared to ground control mice (Figures 3A–3C). Muscle glucose transport
gene expression strongly correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation

process gene expression as shown by the correlation circle plot (Figures 3D–3F) and the correlation heat-
map (Figures 3G–3I). These processes are both high energy demand processes. Thus, decreased energy
intake gene expression correlated with an energy-saving transcriptome in mice quadriceps during
spaceﬂight.
Lipid metabolic processes gene expression in the liver correlates with gene expression
changes in the muscle and muscle atrophy phenotype
Lipid metabolism pathways are among the most reported by GSEA and ORA (Figures 1 and S1). In addition,
discriminating genes after 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA and post DEG 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%
sPLS-DA still maintain this pattern as shown by KEGG ORA (Figures S3A and S3B, Related to Figure 4).
Of note, the two short chain fatty acid ‘‘butanoate’’ and ‘propanoate’’ were always among the most en-
riched KEGG pathways (Figure S3C, Related to Figure 4). Since fatty liver diseases are associated with IR
and diabetes, we investigated whether altered glucose transport gene expression was linked to liver lipid
metabolism. We found that glucose transport process gene expression strongly correlated with liver lipid

DISCUSSION
Despite the systemic and physiological health risk of spaceﬂight, it is a fact that humans have become a
space-faring species. Muscle atrophy has been shown to occur in both weightlessness and bed rest studies.

The decreased gravity load on the locomotive apparatus is often presented as the main driver of muscle
atrophy and bone loss. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were
impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceﬂight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed
that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceﬂight-induced physiological changes (da Silveira
et al., 2020). Mitochondria are complex organelles inside the cell where fundamental biomolecules are
metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and coupled to energy production by the electron
transport chain. Thus, mitochondria play a key role in metabolism and energy management. Here, we
found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the quadriceps and the liver
transcriptome in mice during spaceﬂight. Impaired lipid metabolism and fatty acid accumulation is asso-
ciated with muscle atrophy. Of note, butanoate and propanoate metabolism were the most affected in
the two organs analyzed, decreased in the liver while increased in the muscle. Butanoate and propanoate,
also known as butyrate and propionate, are short chain fatty acids produced in the intestinal lumen by bac-
terial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, especially resistant starch, dietary ﬁber, and to a lesser
extent proteins. Resistant starch is found in some grains, beans, and legumes. The gut microbiome is
disturbed during spaceﬂight; astronauts’ gut microbiome showed an alteration in the composition pattern
of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut (Venegas
et al., 2019), with the presence of different genus increasing or decreasing during spaceﬂight but also
showing a consistent decrease in bacteria from the taxa Pseudobutyrivibrio and Akkermansia, also known
to produce butyrate in the intestine (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Voorhies et al., 2019; Venegas et al.,
2019). Microbiome analysis from RR1 mice showed an overall increase of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes,
but the authors linked that to similar alterations that occur with aging (Jiang et al., 2019). This Firmicute
increase in older mice is seen as a sign of dysbiosis and this alteration was shown to be followed by a
70% decrease in butyrate levels (Spychala et al., 2018). The upregulation of butyrate and propionate path-
ways in the muscle can reﬂect a possible need for these fatty acids and derivatives. In this context, dietary
changes could represent a feasible countermeasure to spaceﬂight-induced physiological changes.
The TCA cycle activity and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ratio are decreased in muscle during spaceﬂight
suggesting disturbed energy production. Consistently, we found that spaceﬂight induced a hyperglycemic
response in mouse muscle involving the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathways downstream
of the insulin receptor (HIF, ErbB, AMPK, FoxO, and PI3K-Akt). This signaling response mostly affected
glucose import gene expression. In addition, high energy demand processes such as DNA repair, auto-
phagy, and translation gene expression were decreased in inﬂight mice quadriceps, suggesting a shift
toward an energy-saving mode in the muscle during spaceﬂight. The muscle is a high energy demand or-
gan. Since the muscle represent up to 50% of the total body mass, its metabolism radically affects glucose
availability in the body. Consequently, glucose sparing and energy saving by the muscle in detrimental con-
ditions can compensate for the energy needs of other such as the brain that requires stable and continuous
glucose supply. Oxidative stress and DNA damage overload, that can impair mitochondrial function and
the metabolism, are examples of detrimental conditions occurring during spaceﬂight (Afshinnekoo
et al., 2020; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Also, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to muscle at-
rophy (Abrigo et al., 2019). The HIF-1 signaling enriched pathways suggest that oxidative stress occurred in
RR1 inﬂight mice. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction promote insulin resistance and diabetes
(Bashan et al., 2009; Di Meo et al., 2017; Sivitz and Yorek, 2010). Our results, in line with previous space
studies, suggest an insulin resistance phenotype. Meanwhile, insulin resistance has been proposed as
an evolutionary mechanism to spare glucose that can beneﬁt survival in various states such as starvation,
immune activation growth, and cancer (Soeters and Soeters, 2012).
Insulin resistance and diabetes are often associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism and liver diseases.
Fatty acids inhibit the insulin signaling pathways by directly interfering in the signaling through diacylgly-
cerol or by overloading the TCA with the precursor acetyl CoA (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al.,
2014; Zhang et al., 2010). During spaceﬂight, liver lipid metabolic gene expression correlated with muscle
glucose import gene expression in RR1 mice. Insulin resistance, NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), and cirrhosis are associated with muscle atrophy and their severity correlates positively (Chakra-
varthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). During a stress starvation, fatty acids
together with ketone bodies become the primary source of energy for cells while peripheral organs such
as the muscle, but also the skin and bones, provide amino acids taken up by central organs such as the liver,
the spleen, immune cells, and healing tissues, ultimately leading to protein loss (Soeters and Soeters,
2012). During a spaceﬂight, all cells are exposed to space stressors such as radiation, endocrine system

perturbation induced by altered circadian rhythm or psychological issues, and microgravity, all promoting
oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, it has been shown that space-
ﬂight induces a shift from slow aerobic and highly enriched mitochondria muscle ﬁbers (‘‘slow ﬁber’’, ‘‘type
I’’) toward fast anaerobic and fast low-enriched mitochondria muscle ﬁber (‘‘fast ﬁber’’, ‘‘type II’’) (Gambara
et al., 2017b; Ulanova et al., 2015). Mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species. As such,
spaceﬂight-induced ﬁber shift and mitochondrial dysfunction can be seen as a biological mechanism to
decrease mitochondrial activity and mitigate oxidative stress. If mitochondrial stress is a central biological
hub during spaceﬂight, and if the mitochondria are the master organelle of metabolism regulation and en-
ergy management, we can then expect a general metabolic shift in the body toward a starvation-like
phenotype that promotes decreased mitochondrial activity, decreased metabolism and protein loss in
the muscle, and increased lipid metabolism in the liver, to the beneﬁt of all body cells during spaceﬂight.
Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle DNA repair, auto-
phagy, translation, and ﬁnally muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression. Butanoate and propanoate
metabolism-related genes were still among the one with the strongest correlation. Interestingly, sodium
butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation improve mitochondrial function, fat accumulation, insulin
resistance, diabetes, and liver diseases (Gao et al., 2009; Khan and Jena, 2016; Mollica et al., 2017; Ye
et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). Moreover, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplemen-
tation decreased muscle atrophy in various conditions (Chang et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2022; Walsh et al.,
2015). Thus, butyrate supplementation or dietary modiﬁcation to stimulate microbial production repre-
sents simple options to counteract muscle atrophy while preventing insulin resistance and lipid accumula-
tion during spaceﬂight.
Gambara et al. previously identiﬁed insulin- and glucose metabolism-linked transcripts as main DEG in
BION-M1 biosatellite ﬂown mice longissimus dorsi. In the present study, 17 and 13 differentially expressed
genes in the liver and the muscle, respectively, were common to the 89 previously identiﬁed (Gambara
et al., 2017a). Acas1a, Cpt2, Agt, Lcn2, and Prkcd, which were among the most DEG in Gambara’s study
were not found signiﬁcantly differentially expressed neither in the liver nor the quadriceps in the present
study. The present study is based on the analyses of discriminating genes identiﬁed by the spls-DA per-
formed with the mixOmics script. This method is designed to identify variations that are correlated, here
gene expression in the liver and gene expression in the quadriceps. Also, 31 over the 9753, among which
Agt and Cpt2, and 24 over the 3463 discriminating genes in the liver and the quadriceps, respectively, were
in common with the 89 of the Gambara’s study. These differences may reﬂect the variability of gene expres-
sion between the different muscle types. Nonetheless, in line with the literature, both converge to an
altered insulin transcriptome, thus highlighting a general adaptive response in muscle during spaceﬂight
despite different molecular pathways. Moreover, the present study highlights the importance of discrimi-
nating genes over DEG in deciphering omic data. We found that discriminating genes are mainly linked to
lipid metabolism in the liver and insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in the quadriceps. This means
that lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver correlates with insulin signaling and glucose metabolism
gene expression in the quadriceps in mice during spaceﬂight. We identiﬁed a cluster of lipid metabolism
processes-related genes in the liver, including Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Ser-
pina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1, correlating the most with glucose transport gene expression and potentially in-
sulin resistance in the muscle. Among these genes, some are already described for their insulin sensitivity.
Fabp2, Abcg5, and Abcg8 genes polymorphisms are associated with insulin sensitivity while Apom might
protect against insulin resistance (Gylling et al., 2004; Kurano et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2020).
Interestingly, Sestrin 1 (Sesn1), a well-known regulator of cell metabolism upregulated in longissimus dorsi
of BION-M1 mice, was reported as a discriminating gene in both the liver and the quadriceps (Gambara
et al., 2017a). Sestrin proteins are involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, autophagy,
and insulin signaling (Lee et al., 2013). Sesn1 together with the present lipid metabolism-related gene clus-
ter may thus account in insulin resistance research.
The liver inﬂuence on quadriceps gene expression we identiﬁed needs to be carried out by organ commu-
nication mechanisms and we identiﬁed hepatokines as the most likely effector. Hepatokines are proteins
secreted by the liver that can modulate signaling pathways associated with energy metabolism in the mus-
cle and inﬂuence the development of chronic metabolic diseases (Seo et al., 2021). Important for our
context, an increased blood concentration of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin increases insulin sensi-
tivity, muscle hypertrophy, and mitochondrial function and diminishes fat mass in the muscle (Seo et al.,
2021). Interestingly, increased concentration of Fetuin-A showed to have the inverse effect of the previously

described hepatokines (Jensen-Cody and Potthoff, 2021; Seo et al., 2021). The levels of Fetuin-A increase
after 60 day of bed rest, a ground model for microgravity effects, and we found in the literature a positive
correlation between the Fetuin-A levels and the gene expression of Serpina6 and Rdh7, two genes we iden-
tiﬁed in our gene cluster (Herrmann et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2020). Interestingly,
Fetuin-A, as well as FGF21 and ANGPTL4 genes are among the correlating genes in the liver of mice during
spaceﬂight reported by the liver versus quadriceps sPLS-DA. We hypothesize that the gene expression cor-
relation identiﬁed in our work likely involves an increased Fetuin-A production by the liver and a diminished
production of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin.
In conclusion, we described for the ﬁrst time a strong correlation between liver lipid metabolism gene
expression and the downregulation of hypoglycemic and energy demand process-related genes. In the
light of current knowledge, our result suggests that a starvation-like phenotype could promote a metabolic
shift toward an energy-saving mode, resource sparring, and lipid mobilization through a tight liver-muscle
crosstalk contributing to muscle atrophy during spaceﬂight. Dietary changes based on starch supplemen-
tation and microbiome modulation represent an affordable and sustainable countermeasure to support
our planetary goals and outer space settlement. Meanwhile, improving food habits and body energy moni-
toring is an overall human challenge both on Earth and beyond.
Limitations of the study
Sample size was only six mice to match sample availability in the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome.
Future space studies should be designed to match individuals for any factors (organs, environmental pa-
rameters, psychological parameters, etc.).
Here, we studied biological processes and pathways at a transcriptional level. Transcription regulation,
post-transcriptional stabilization, and post-translational modiﬁcations impact cell response from gene
expression to the ﬁnal protein activity. In addition, transcriptomics provides a static view of one single
moment in the cell. However, spatial repartition also impacts molecular dynamics, and a transcriptional
ecosystem theory has been deﬁned (Silveira and Bilodeau, 2018). To further understand the biological sig-
niﬁcance of the transcriptomic response to spaceﬂight in mice quadriceps, both functional analysis and
multi-omics studies are needed.
Additional factors account for inducing muscle atrophy during spaceﬂight. Circadian rhythm pathways
genes are among those enriched in both the quadriceps and the liver in mice during spaceﬂight
(Figure S1B, Related to Figures 1 and 2A), and circadian rhythm perturbation is associated with muscle at-
rophy (Choi et al., 2020). Astronauts experience continuous circadian rhythm stressors on board the ISS,
with sixteen sunsets per day and sustained artiﬁcial light exposure as the only illumination source. However,
assessing and deciphering circadian rhythm dynamics and correlation at molecular levels require proper
protocol and experimental design (Zeitgeber time method) that should be implemented in future space
biology research.
We used the method implemented in mixOmics between the same molecular variables. This method is a
powerful tool to compare any types of datasets. In this context, multiple variables comparisons, e.g., tem-
perature variation inside the spacecrafts, food intake levels, dietary type, cognitive performances, psycho-
logical parameters, and allowing multiscale comparisons, will considerably widen our understanding of
spaceﬂight’s impact on living organisms. The list of possible datasets combinations is inﬁnite, as much
as the number of studies which can raise from.

harvesting, disposal, and experiments have been previously conducted and performed by external exper-
imenters. Thus, animal procedures were performed according to the relevant guide-lines at each institution
and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Full experimental pro-
cedures are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ and https://

Brieﬂy, the study was conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2014 on twelves female
C57BL/6J mice, six in ﬂight mice (M23, M24, M25, M26, M27, M28) referred to as the FLT group, and six
ground controls mice (M33, M34, M35, M36, M37, M38), referred to as the GC group, for 37 days upon
12h day/night cycle, and fed with Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)63. The research platform
used for this experiment was NASA’s Rodent Research Hardware System also referred to as the Rodent
Research Habitat System. Mice were sacriﬁced with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation
on orbit on the ISS for the FLT group, and on the ground at the same time for the GC group. The entire
carcasses of 10 mice were stored at 80C until processing. Two FLT mice were dissected on-board the
ISS, and livers were isolated on-orbit and stored in the MELFI. Frozen FLT mice carcasses were then re-
turned on Earth by the SpaceX-4 spacecraft and delivered to the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) for
disposal. The ten frozen mice carcasses, GC and FLT, were dissected at room temperature, and harvested
samples stored at 80C.
RNA extraction from 20–30mg mice liver and muscle were realized at 4C using a lysis buffer (Qiagen, Va-
lenica, CA) and a beta-mercaptoethanol (1:100)/Buffer RLT solution, lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and
kept on ice. Samples were then homogenized for 20 s at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld
homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were
centrifuged for 3 min at room temperature to remove tissue debris. RNA from homogenates were further
puriﬁed using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and eluted in DNase/RNase-
free water. RNA concentrations were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA), and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA sequencing and library construction was performed on 1 mg
of RNA having RIN values of 7 or above, using Illumina HiSeq 4000 kit and experimental protocol.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
RNAseq data processing
Raw FASTQ ﬁles were proceed using the ‘‘GeneLab RNAseq data processing protocol’’ as reported at
https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/
and
https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.
gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168. On this work we used the mentioned protocol up to the step ‘‘Quanti-
ﬁcation data was imported to R (version 3.6.0) with tximport’’.
R
Differential Expression (DE) analysis has been performed using the R studio software Version 1.2.5001 and
the DESeq2 package version 1.30.1 that uses shrinkage estimation for dispersion and fold change. RSEM
expected counts were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. Sta-
tistical signiﬁcance of differentially expressed genes (FDR %0.05) were assessed using Benjamini-
Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure.
Biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis
For biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis, normalized count from RR1 mice quadri-
ceps and liver were processed by the DEseq2 package and assessed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathways Over Representation Analysis on the online Webgesalt platform, and for Gene
Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) and KEGG pathways GeneSets Enrichment by the Gene Set Enrich-
ment Analysis (GSEA) software. The Cytoscape software was used to build geneset networks from GSEA
results. GSEAs were run with a ‘‘Flight vs Ground Control’’ comparison setting. The ranked list of genes
was deﬁned by the signal-to-noise metric, and the statistical signiﬁcance were determined by 1000 permu-
tations of the gene sets. Enrichment importance were sorted according to the enrichment score calculated
by GSEA (Mu¨ ller, 2019). Venn diagrams were generated on the online platform Venny available at: https://
bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index2.0.2.html.

mixOmics
mixomics is a R package developed by Kim-anh Leˆ Cao, Se´ bastien De´ jean and collaborators to visualize
associations between paired omics datasets using correlation circles plots, heatmaps, and networks (Duru-
ﬂe´ et al., 2021; Gonza´lez et al., 2012; Rohart et al., 2017). In the present study we used mixOmics package
version 6.14.1. More information can be found on the online mixOmics platform available at: http://
mixomics.org/.
sPLS and sPLS-DA
Transcriptome from 6 matched NASA RR1 mice, 3 ground controls (M36, M37, M38) and 3 inﬂight (M25,
M26, M28), between the liver and the quadriceps were analyzed by sPLS (Partial Least Square) and sPLS-
DA (sparse Partial Least Square-Differential Analysis). Correlation circle and correlation network were
generated from sPLS-DA performed on 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of total normalized counts according
to the process suggested in Duruﬂe´ et al. (2021). This method is an internal method to validate that the
pattern of genes evaluated with the strongest importance for discrimination maintain across input reduc-
tion. These genes are referred to as to ‘‘discriminating genes’’ in this study. The correlation circle plot is a 1
sized radius were variable pools located between |0,5| and |1| have the strongest correlation. Correlation
heatmaps are generated from sPLS analyses. Post 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA DEG are DEG still
present in reported genes from 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA. R scripts used for this study are avail-
able at: http://mixomics.org/case-studies/spls-liver-toxicity-case-study/.
