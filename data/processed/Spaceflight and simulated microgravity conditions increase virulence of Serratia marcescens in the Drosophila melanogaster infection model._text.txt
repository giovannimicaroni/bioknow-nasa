While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceﬂight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood
and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is
growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by spaceﬂight and ground-based spaceﬂight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia
marcescens (strain Db11) was signiﬁcantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station
than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were
passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions
on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-ﬂown bacteria was similar in magnitude between
wild-type ﬂies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to
the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared
ﬂies infected with space-ﬂown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceﬂight bacteria grew at
a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in
pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need
to be characterized.

INTRODUCTION
As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is
considerable interest in understanding the changes in human
physiology under spaceﬂight conditions. Spaceﬂight includes not
only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation,
isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous
studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a signiﬁcant
impact on the ability of the immune system to respond
appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5
changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7 and
general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and
adaptive immune systems.8,9
This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important
when considering that there have been studies demonstrating
signiﬁcant effects of microgravity and spaceﬂight conditions on
the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17
Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause
persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have
been
shown
to
have
increased
growth
in
spaceﬂight,18,19
increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21
Investigations of the effects of spaceﬂight in humans have been
especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and
variability in experimental methodology.22 The fruit ﬂy (Drosophila
melanogaster) is a promising model for understanding the effects
of spaceﬂight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have
been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune
gene expression following spaceﬂight.23,24 Using invertebrate
models for investigating the human immune system has proven
both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short
generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with
high homology to humans.25,26 While invertebrates lack a
characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate
immune response of Drosophila melanogaster is highly similar to
humans,25,27,28 with about 75% of human disease-causing genes
with a functional homolog in the fruit ﬂy.25,29
The human opportunistic bacteria Serratia marcescens has only
recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence
and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31
Furthermore, S. marcescens has been found aboard the spacecraft
Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space
Station (ISS),32,33 suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should
be monitored closely for spaceﬂight-induced changes that may
pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be
more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. D. melanogaster has
been recently used as a model for studying S. marcescens, as there
are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught ﬂies
that are pathogenic.34–38 Importantly, the speciﬁc strains used in
this study are not pathogenic to humans,34 making this system an
ideal model for safely studying spaceﬂight-induced changes to S.
marcescens using a model system.
Studies in true spaceﬂight conditions are difﬁcult to perform
due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the
complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and

mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on
the effects of spaceﬂight on bacteria are also followed up with
ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39 which
allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In
this study, the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens was
sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceﬂight
conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both
as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity
conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to
investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be
replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study,
space-ﬂown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used
to infect D. melanogaster to investigate changes in space-induced
lethality, both in wild-type ﬂies, as well as in immune pathway
mutants. Results showed that both space-ﬂown and ground-based
microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or
LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence of Serratia
marcescens on D. melanogaster hosts. Interestingly, the increased
virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-ﬂown and
LSMMG-treated
bacteria
under
ground
conditions.
Taken
together, this suggests that spaceﬂight induces a physiological
change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of
the D. melanogaster host and that this effect can be reversed after
the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground.
RESULTS
Survival of D. melanogaster after infection with spaceﬂight
samples
Fly survival was signiﬁcantly lower when infected with spaceﬂight-
exposed Serratia marcescens samples compared to the ground
control bacterial samples (Fig. 1). For the ﬁrst spaceﬂight sample
(Space 1), survival was signiﬁcantly different from both Ground 1
(P < 0.0001) and Ground 2 (P < 0.0001) samples. The same was true
for the second spaceﬂight isolate (Space 2) when compared with
ground control samples. Full statistical results are reported in
Table 1. Space 1 and Space 2 were separate samples of bacteria
collected from two different plates after spaceﬂight, and both
showed increased virulence compared to ground control bacteria.
However they also showed differences between each other in
terms of the magnitude of their changes with Space 1 causing
greater virulence changes compared to Space 2 samples. This is
discussed later in the context of temporary/reversible physiologi-
cal changes induced by spaceﬂight vs genetic/heritable changes
in the bacteria (see below for “Host survival after injection of ﬁrst
ground subculture of spaceﬂight sample”).
In vivo growth of spaceﬂight S. marcescens in ﬂy host after
injection
In vivo growth of injected bacteria was not signiﬁcantly different
between space and ground samples at hours 0 (F = 0.9113,
P = 0.489), 6 (F = 0.5316, P = 0.6772) or 9 (F = 1.169, P = 0.3964)
post-injection. At hour 12 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space
1 sample was signiﬁcantly higher in the ﬂy host than the Ground
sample (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.0011). At hour 15 post-
injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 remained signiﬁcantly higher
than Ground (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.04), and Space 2
in vivo growth was signiﬁcantly higher than Ground (P = 0.006)
(Fig. 1b). Therefore, the kinetics of bacterial growth within the host
are different for the bacterial cultures returning from space
compared to the ground control samples, particularly 12 h and
onwards post-infection. In vitro growth of the space-ﬂown
bacteria, outside the host, show a similar increase in growth
kinetics at later time points compared to the ground control
bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Host survival after injection of ﬁrst ground subculture of
spaceﬂight sample
Given that two separate isolates of bacteria had shown increased
virulence after spaceﬂight exposure (Fig. 1), we wanted to assess
whether these changes were reversible physiological changes in
the bacteria induced by the stress of spaceﬂight or whether they
were genetically heritable changes induced, for instance, by
ionizing radiation exposure during spaceﬂight. After subculturing
spaceﬂight and ground samples of S. marcescens in normal Earth
gravity

survival
was
not
signiﬁcantly different from either Ground 1 (P = 0.995) or Ground
2 (P = 0.337) host injected samples. Similarly, Space 2 subculture-
infected hosts did not show signiﬁcant differences in survival from

Ground 1 (P = 0.5223) or Ground 2 (P = 0.113) infected hosts (Fig.
2a). Full statistical output is reported in Table 2. These results
suggest that the increased virulence detected after spaceﬂight
were temporary changes acquired by the bacteria during space-
ﬂight and that after subculturing under normal conditions on
Earth, these differences were no longer detectable after infection
of fruit ﬂy hosts.
In vivo growth after injection of ﬁrst ground subculture of
spaceﬂight sample
There was no signiﬁcant difference of in vivo growth of the
spaceﬂight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig. 2b) at hours 0
(F = 13.41, P = 0.146), 9 (F = 0.238, P = 0.866), 12 (F = 0.443,
P = 0.731) or 15 (F = 0.479, P = 0.708) hours post-infection. This
data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences
detected in virulence of the ﬁrst ground subcultures in the host
(Fig. 2a).
Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria
Since spaceﬂight opportunities are relatively infrequent, a model
that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity
conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel
(HARV) or the RWV.15,17,39 We used the RWV apparatus to assess
whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes
that we had measured from the spaceﬂight samples by simulating
the low ﬂuid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This
is done by rotating the vessel in a perpendicular orientation,
where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects
of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells.
In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force
vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed
to settle.11,13 Host survival was signiﬁcantly lower for hosts
infected with S. marcescens that was grown in LSMMG compared
to both the PBS Sham (ratio = 4.42, P < 0.0001) and the RWV
Control (Ratio = 3.37, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 3a). The RWV Control
consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity
but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the
LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to 1 g Earth’s gravity.11
Figure 3a therefore shows that we are able to recreate increased
virulence in S. marcescens bacteria by simulating microgravity on
Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the
spaceﬂight environment is at least one important factor to
consider in terms of increased virulence in S. marcescens.

In vivo growth of LSMMG S. marcescens
There was no signiﬁcant difference of in vivo growth between the
LSMMG and RWV-Control bacteria at hour 0 (F = 3.551, P = 0.128)
or at hour 6 post-infection (F = 7.493, P = 0.0544). However, there
was a signiﬁcant difference in CFU counts per ﬂy between the
LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours 9 (F = 20.428, P = 0.008), 12
(F = 12.455, P = 0.019), and 15 (F = 18.427, P = 0.009) post-
infection (Fig. 3b). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some
of the differences observed previously with the spaceﬂight
samples (Fig. 1b), where the bacterial samples that show increased
virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host
particularly at later time points.
Infection of Immune Deﬁciency (Imd) and Toll pathway mutants of
D. melanogaster
Since the increase in virulence of spaceﬂight bacteria was
accompanied by an increase in the rate of growth of the bacteria
within the ﬂy host, we wanted to determine whether this was a
result of a change that the bacteria were able to induce in the host
by weakening the hosts’ immune system for example, or whether
the bacterial physiology was altered to better withstand the host’s
immune defenses. In order to test this hypothesis, we used ﬂies
that were mutant in two of the major immune defense pathways
in ﬂies, the Imd and the Toll pathways.40,41 As expected, all Imd
mutant ﬂies (PGRP-LCΔ5, imd1, and relishE20) succumb to any Sm
infections (including ground control Sm) much more quickly than
either of the wild-type ﬂy lines (y1w* or w1118) as seen in Fig. 4a,
since the Imd pathway is known to be critical for defense against
infection with Gram-negative bacteria,42 such as Serratia marces-
cens. On the other hand, the Toll pathway is primarily known to be
important for defense against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal
infections. Therefore as expected, there is much less change in the
viability of Toll deﬁcient mutants (PGRP-SAseml and dif1) after
ground control Sm infections compared to wild-type ﬂies (Fig. 4c).
Compared to ground control Sm however, the spaceﬂight bacteria
Space 1 causes greater lethality in all of the ﬂy lines (compare Fig.
4b vs a, and 4d vs c). Therefore the data suggests that regardless
of the genotype of the ﬂy host, whether impaired for immune
function or robust wild-type lines, the space-ﬂown bacteria causes
greater lethality than ground control Sm. The statistical output is
shown in Supplementary Tables 2–6.
RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host
To further test whether infection with microgravity-treated
bacteria induced changes in gene expression in the ground-
reared host, RNA sequencing was performed for wild-type fruit
ﬂies after infection with either spaceﬂight or ground control
sample of S. marcescens. These results showed that there were few
signiﬁcant changes in host gene expression of known immune-
related genes when exposed to the two bacterial sample types
(Fig. 4e, Supplementary Table 1).
At the signiﬁcance threshold (q-values < 0.05), only eleven
transcripts were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed. However
principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abun-
dance across the treatments showed that there is signiﬁcant
overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few
differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground
bacteria-infected fruit ﬂy hosts (Fig. 4f). It is worth noting that,
since the ﬂies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18 h post-
injection, this may have biased the selection of ﬂies in which
infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this
late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both
conditions to a control sham condition shown by PCA supports
this idea.
Comparing the space bacteria-infected ground ﬂies to the
ground
bacteria-infected
ﬂies,
there
were
a
total
of
11
differentially expressed genes (see Fig. 4e and Supplementary
Table 1 for gene details). Out of these 11 differentially expressed
genes, only AttA (Attacin-A) is known to be directly related to the
immune response.43 The gene AttA is an antimicrobial peptide
that is expressed in the fat body in response to Gram-negative
pathogens.43 The most highly overexpressed gene is lola (long-
itudinals lacking), a gene that is involved in axon growth and
guidance in the central and peripheral nervous systems.44 The
next most highly overexpressed gene is vsg (visgun), a gene linked
to alcohol sensitivity.45 Among the most underexpressed genes is
eEF2, is a translation elongation factor,46 and CG31650 with
unknown function. The underexpressed RhoGEF2 has been
recently linked to wound repair, but is primarily involved in the
regulation of actin and myosin dynamics through interacting
effector proteins.47 While only one of these genes is directly
related to the host immune pathway, follow-up studies will be
conducted to elucidate the potential role of these additional
differentially expressed genes in the host.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that ﬂies infected with a bacterial
pathogen that had been grown during spaceﬂight was signiﬁ-
cantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig. 1). This trend
persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions,
suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating
the differences in virulence seen in the spaceﬂight bacteria strains
(Fig. 3). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the
ﬁrst subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the
differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after
being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig. 2). This is
consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceﬂight-
induced changes to pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia
coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus reverted
upon return to Earth conditions.10
We also sought to understand whether the host immune
system may be responding differently to spaceﬂight-altered
bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that
space-ﬂown pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared
to their ground-reared counterparts,15,16 less is known about how
the host immune system may be inﬂuenced differently by space-
ﬂown pathogens. This is also the ﬁrst study in spaceﬂight and in
simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes
of the pathogen S. marcescens in a live host, as previous studies in
the ﬁeld of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on
Salmonella15 and other microbes.48–50 Utilizing common immune
pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the
Imd or Toll pathways were altered, infection with spaceﬂight
sample decreases survival of ﬂies compared to infection with
ground sample of S. marcescens (Fig. 4). Studies in spaceﬂight and
modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed
to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered
by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.51 Other studies have shown
that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then
tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on
the speciﬁc pathogen used.52 Similarly in our study with ground-
reared ﬂy host, while there appear to be few genes that are
differentially expressed after injection with spaceﬂight-exposed
Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria,
most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to
be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 4c,
Supplementary Table 1). This antimicrobial peptide is known to
respond to Gram-negative pathogens,43 so an increase in
expression in response to S. marcescens is expected. However,
the increase in expression in space-infected ﬂies compared to
ground-infected ﬂies may be due to the increase in bacterial load
in the space-infected individuals.

Because there is a signiﬁcant increase of in vivo growth seen in
both spaceﬂight samples and LSMMG samples, it may be possible
that some of these host genes may have an unknown interaction
with the immune system that facilitates the faster proliferation of
microgravity-experienced bacteria after infection. However given
that the space-ﬂown bacteria have faster growth kinetics in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. 1) as well as in vivo, the current results
indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following
infection of bacteria altered by spaceﬂight and LSMMG are likely
due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host
immune response of ground-reared ﬂies.
This study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that spaceﬂight inﬂuences
the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on a
solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell
density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension
during spaceﬂight (reviewed in Huang et al.,53) the few studies
that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in
ﬁnal cell density.54 Therefore, it was concluded that because there
is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to a
surface compared to those in a liquid suspension where there
would be a lack of convection, that one should not expect to see a
change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in
spaceﬂight. This argument is based on the idea that the bacteria
are being affected indirectly by microgravity, due to the change in
the physical properties of the liquid media that they are in, and
not the effect of a change in gravity vector on the microbes
themselves.55

However, Serratia marcescens is a nosocomial pathogen that can
colonize a wide variety of habitats, and undergo signiﬁcant
phenotypic shifts depending on the properties of the growth
media,56–58 including shifts in the polarity of the ﬂagella on solid
media to produce swarming cells. Because it’s thought that
LSMMG may inﬂuence cell polarity in some single-celled organ-
isms, it’s at least theoretically possible that some of these species
may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on a
solid substrate.59 A previous study showed that growth of E.coli
and B.subtilis on agar in spaceﬂight did not show increased growth
rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the
samples.54 Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in
space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depend-
ing on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their
normal habitat.
While Wang et al.60 showed that S. marcescens did not change
in physical properties on a semi-solid media in spaceﬂight
conditions, they did provide evidence that signiﬁcant transcrip-
tomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in
spaceﬂight sample compared to ground. We believe that these
molecular and biological changes observed in S. marcescens on a
semi-solid media in spaceﬂight provide a basis for the phenotypic
changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi-
deﬁned media. While there was insufﬁcient bacterial sample to
conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current
study, a subsequent spaceﬂight experiment in our lab has been
conducted with S. marcescens to further characterize molecular
changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be
reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be
limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both
solid and liquid media types is warranted. A study performed with
a different strain of S. marcescens (ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid
media showed that while there was no signiﬁcant change in
growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance,
providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species
to microgravity and LSMMG.61 Ongoing work in our lab, including
more in-depth characterization of S. marcescens under LSMMG
and spaceﬂight conditions, are currently being conducted to
further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological
mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence
seen in altered gravity.
A previous study found that growth rate was not a major factor
affecting the physiology and virulence of one strain S. marces-
cens,62 but there is speculation that growth rate and virulence may
be linked due to common factors that inﬂuence both character-
istics.63,64 Recent studies in humans demonstrated that slower
growth rates of Bacillus pathogens actually predicted higher
virulence,65 suggesting that there is conﬂicting data that likely
varies by species and environmental factors and that growth rates
may be linked to virulence. In the current study, not only was the
in vitro growth at later time points signiﬁcantly higher in the
spaceﬂight strains than in the ground control strains (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1), and there is a signiﬁcant difference with in vivo
growth after infection with spaceﬂight and ground control strains
(Fig. 1b), as well as increased in vivo growth in LSMMG bacteria
compared to the RWV-control (Fig. 3b). This suggests that bacteria
growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between
spaceﬂight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not
ﬁnd signiﬁcant changes in host immune-related genes after
infection with spaceﬂight sample compared to ground sample in
wild-type ground-reared ﬂies (Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Table
1).
Furthermore, in vitro growth was signiﬁcantly higher for
spaceﬂight samples compared to ground samples, speciﬁcally
starting around hour 12, which is consistent with the in vivo
increase in growth after injections (Supplementary Fig. 1). Previous
studies have shown that the media composition and nutrient
availability can have signiﬁcant effects on growth kinetics and
virulence of pathogens.16 Current studies in our laboratory are
testing whether microgravity treatment confers a speciﬁc growth
advantage over ground bacteria at later times in growth when
speciﬁc nutrients may become limiting in the media, as well as
whether or not growth kinetics can be affected by the inclusion or
exclusion of speciﬁc growth factors from the media. Speciﬁcally, it
may be possible that the spaceﬂight and LSMMG environment
may confer some advantage to the bacteria when nutrients
become limited, such that the low ﬂuid shear environment allows
growth to either increase or not become hindered by the decrease
in nutrient in the media over time.
This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying
molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG
and spaceﬂight conditions, which has become a ﬁeld of great
interest recently. It has been shown that after spaceﬂight, there
are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be
related to virulence15,17 and that some pathogens are more likely
to form bioﬁlms after exposure to spaceﬂight.18 Because the
pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are
similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous
studies, it may be expected that there are quantiﬁable genetic
mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival
we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on
eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are
driving increased virulence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
D. melanogaster ﬂy strains
Fly lines were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar
media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid,
ethanol) at ambient temperature (~24 °C). All ﬂy lines were obtained from
Bloomington Stock center including w1118 (#3605), OregonR SP2 (no. 2376),
relE20 (no. 55714), y1w* (no. 55707), dif1 (no. 36559), imd1 (no. 55711),
PGRP-LCΔ5 (#36323), and PGRP-SAseml (#55716).
Bacterial growth conditions during spaceﬂight
The hardware used in this study was the FIT (Fly Immunity and Tumors)
cassette and changeout platform, as described in our previous Drosophila
experiments on the ISS.23,66 Food trays were prepared using the methods
described below, and stored in a cargo transfer bag (CTB) at 4 °C for
launch. Towards the end of the 30 day spaceﬂight (Fruit Fly Lab – 01 on
SpaceX-CRS 5 mission), the food trays containing S. marcescens were
retrieved from 4 °C storage and placed within the FIT food changeout
platform. The platform was placed in a canvas CTB at ISS ambient
temperature (23–25 °C) for 5 days, plus 2 days in the SpaceX Dragon
(22–25 °C) for undocking/descent and retrieval. During the growth period,
environmental data (CO2, O2, temperature, and relative humidity) was
recorded and used to match the growth conditions for ground control
experiments.
Preparation of S. marcescens Db11 for spaceﬂight
Serratia marcescens Db11 was obtained from the University of Minnesota C.
elegans stock center. To prepare for the spaceﬂight experiment, the
Db11 strain was grown for 20 h in liquid LB broth with 100 µg/mL
streptomycin at 37 °C and then diluted to an OD600 of 0.100 in PBS. Next,
100 µL of the diluent was spread onto the surface of two trays containing
2 mL of solid semi-deﬁned ﬂy food media containing 4% Brewer’s yeast
(Redstar), 6% glucose, 3% sucrose, 2% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% agar,
0.05% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.05% calcium chloride dihydrate
(Sigma), 0.5% of blue food dye (Smart and Final), 0.001% p-hydro-
xybenzoate, and 0.6% of propionic acid (Sigma) dissolved in water. These
two trays were the source of the Space 1 and Space 2 samples that were
used in the experiments below. Similarly, we prepared two additional trays
(Ground 1 and Ground 2) from the same source sample. These two trays
were grown in the same FIT hardware on the ground, inside an incubator
(Percival model DR36VL), which was programmed to match the gas
composition, temperature, and humidity proﬁles measured during the
ﬂight.

After preparing the bacterial sample trays for ﬂight, they were placed into
plastic bags and stored at 4 °C, then sent to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-5.
Control trays were stored on the ground at 4 °C. Growth conditions on the
ISS were described in the previous section. Upon retrieval after the
spaceﬂight mission, bacteria were isolated from the surfaces using sterile
cell scrapers and then placed into 50% glycerol and stored frozen at −80 °C.
Similar isolation was performed in parallel for the ground samples.
The placement of the bacterial cultures on semi-deﬁned ﬂy food media
allowed for inﬂight infection of ﬂies, as ﬂies would ingest the bacteria that
was growing on the media. However, due to logistical constraints during
ﬂight, in-ﬂight infection was not possible and the bacterial cultures were
grown in space and harvested after return for treatment of ﬂies on the
ground after ﬂight as described in the following sections.
Injection of spaceﬂight S. marcescens Db11 samples into D.
melanogaster
Injections of bacteria were performed according to methods described
previously by our group and others.23,67 Concentrations of spaceﬂight and
ground samples stored in 50% glycerol at −80 °C were determined by
performing colony counts on LB plates. These samples were then diluted in
PBS (phosphate buffered saline) down to ~4 × 103 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for
injections. Sterile 12.5% glycerol in sterile PBS was used as a sham injection
control. For survival experiments and in vivo growth assays for both
spaceﬂight bacteria and ground-based simulated microgravity-treated
bacteria, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientiﬁc) was used with the 32 nL
injection volume setting (Figs 1–4). Concentrations were adjusted so that
each injection was ~10 CFU/ﬂy. Control, ground, or spaceﬂight samples
were then injected into anesthetized 2–3 day-old female (post-eclosion) D.
melanogaster in the ventrolateral abdomen. Injections of immune mutant
ﬂies were done using a Picospritzer III (Parker Hanniﬁn, New Hampshire).
Injection bolus was calibrated to 600 nm diameter, which equaled
approximately 10 CFU/ﬂy. Injections of each treatment group took <1 h,
with the survival measurements beginning at the end of that ﬁrst hour.
After injections, ﬂies were kept at 25 °C on the same standard dextrose
food that they were reared on, and survival was monitored every hour for
at least 24 h. Survival curves were measured by performing three
independent experiments using a minimum of N = 50 ﬂies in each
experiment, then pooling the data from all three experiments for the Cox
Proportional Hazard survival analysis, which measures the magnitude of
difference in survival between different treatment groups.
In vivo bacterial load was assayed in the ﬂy at 0, 9, 12, and 15 h post-
injection. Bacterial load was assayed immediately following injection by
placing three ﬂies in 200 µL of PBS and homogenized for ~1 min using a
handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). This homogenization
procedure was repeated for each condition tested. Next, 100 µL of this
sample was then spread/plated onto an LB agar plate. To assay subsequent
time-points, three ﬂies were placed in 200 µL of PBS and homogenized as
above. This sample was then serially diluted, 20 µL into 180 µL of PBS until
a dilution of 105 was obtained. Next, 40 µL from each dilution from 100 to
105 was then spot plated onto an LB agar plate and allowed to dry. All
plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight before counting. Each in vivo
bacterial load experiment was independently repeated three times and
each experiment included three replicate samples per time point for all
experiments. Error bars were calculated to represent one standard error.
Due to limited bacterial sample availability from the spaceﬂight mission
and the time required to inject 50 or more individual ﬂies per condition per
experiment, not all samples (Space 1 and 2, Ground 1 and 2) were included
in every experiment. After initial experiments had veriﬁed the consistency
of the virulence data from Space 1 and Space 2 samples relative to the
Ground 1 and Ground 2 samples, only one sample from each spaceﬂight
and ground condition was chosen in subsequent studies.
Ground subcultures of spaceﬂight sample
Injections to test the virulence of space-ﬂown bacteria were performed as
noted above where the spaceﬂight and ground bacteria were diluted in
PBS from frozen glycerol stocks and directly injected into the ﬂy host.
However to test whether the space-ﬂown bacteria would retain their
increased virulence after growing under ground conditions for several
generations, bacterial cultures were ﬁrst allowed to grow for 24 h (~23
generations of growth) on the ground before injecting into Drosophila
hosts. A sterile inoculation loop was used to transfer a small amount of
glycerol stocks into liquid LB + 100 µg/mL streptomycin, then grown for
24 h in a 37 °C incubator with a shaker set to 225 rpm. These samples were
then diluted in PBS down to ~4 × 103 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections,
and injections were performed as described above.
Growth of S. marcescens Db11 in the RWV
Cultures of Db11 were grown from non-spaceﬂight lab stocks of Db11
frozen at −80 °C in Copan Cryovials, onto agar plates with streptomycin
(LB + 100 µg/mL) for 18–24 h and then stored at 4 °C for at most 2 weeks.
Liquid subcultures were created using a single colony from these agar
plates and grown in conical tubes at 37 °C in liquid LB media containing
100 µg/mL streptomycin at 25 rpm for 24 h. These liquid subcultures were
then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media before being further
diluted 1:1000 in LB + 100 µg/mL streptomycin and placed into a sterile
disposable 10 mL RWV (Synthecon). Air bubbles were removed from the
RWV and sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either horizontal
(simulated microgravity or LSMMG) or vertical (normal gravity, NG) axis at
37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al.11) Samples were grown
for 24 h to ensure that stationary phase was reached.
Injection of RWV samples into D. melanogaster
Injections were performed as noted above with the following alterations.
Stationary phase cultures from RWV were diluted down to an A600 of 0.100
in PBS and then further diluted down 1/100 fold to an end concentration
of ~8 × 103 CFU/mL in PBS. Approximately 65 nL of sterile PBS, LSMMG, or
NG cultures were then injected into 2–3-day old ﬂies as noted above.
Survival and bacterial load were both monitored as previously stated.
RNA extraction and sequencing from infected ﬂy host
In order to see whether there was any difference in host immunity after
infection with Space or Ground bacteria, RNA was extracted in triplicate
from two live ground-reared adult ﬂies for each treatment (space or
ground sample injection) approximately 18 h after infection using the
Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (catalog no. 74104) with β-mercaptoethanol
(10 µL/mL) in the lysis buffer. Lysis was performed by placing the ﬂies in a
1.5 mL tube containing 600 µL of the lysis buffer, which were then
homogenized for ~1 min using a handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes,
New Jersey). The entire homogenate was then placed in the manufacturer-
supplied spin column, where an on-column DNase digestion step was
performed as per manufacturer recommendation). An additional puriﬁca-
tion step was added using additional wash steps with the kit buffers.
Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with 100 bp
reads and paired-end library prep. Transcript abundance estimates from
the raw sequenced reads were made using kallisto (version 0.42.4)68 and
the D. melanogaster reference transcriptome (build r6.13). Differential
expression analysis between Space and Ground bacteria infection
conditions was performed using sleuth (version 0.30.0) Wald test.69
Transcripts with q-values < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcantly differentially
expressed.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and JMP Pro 13
(SAS). Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and in Excel (version 15.4).
For survival analyses, a Cox Proportional Hazards model was used, with the
exception of the Toll and Imd mutant injections, for which a Log-rank
Mantel-Cox analysis was performed to compare curves across treatments.
The Cox Proportional Hazards model allows for the comparison of survival
between all groups when there are multiple risk factors or treatments
involved. For in vivo growth measurements, a one-way ANOVA was used in
combination with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis. For all statistical
analyses with the exception of the ﬁrst subculture growth and survival,
only results with a statistical signiﬁcance < 0.05 are reported, due to the
magnitude of results tables.
Ethics statement
We use the invertebrate model system Drosophila melanogaster for this
study, in accordance, the study was exempt from ethics committee
approval.
