Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including
muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceﬂight on the ovary and
estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceﬂight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice (n = 10)
were exposed to and sacriﬁced on-orbit after 37 days of spaceﬂight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preﬂight baseline,
vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacriﬁce and similar tissue
collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial
carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was ﬁxed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The
proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ
between baseline, vivarium, and ﬂight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid
concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower (p < 0.05) in habitat and
ﬂight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across
groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous
cycle classiﬁcation of all female mice ﬂown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceﬂight were observed at
different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.

INTRODUCTION
Spaceﬂight microgravity is known to impact numerous physiolo-
gical systems. These include cardiovascular changes, decreased
bone mineral density, loss of muscle tone, adipogenesis, insulin
resistance, vision and vestibular disturbances, altered ﬂuid and
electrolyte balance, and altered kidney function to name a few1.
Many, if not all, normal homeostatic processes occurring within
mammals, both male and female, are dramatically impacted by
gonadal hormones. Indeed, the reproductive system is often
considered one of the best markers of overall health and ﬁtness of
an animal2. However, research is limited regarding the effects of
spaceﬂight on the reproductive system and its consequences on
normal physiology3,4.
The ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone, play
a signiﬁcant role in regulating a myriad of physiological functions,
and are subject to cyclic changes based on the hypothalamic/
pituitary regulation of ovarian folliculogenesis5. Moreover, ovarian
steroidogenic output can be dramatically impacted by stress as
well as other internal homeostatic processes6. In cycling rodents,
the antral follicle is the primary steroidogenic tissue within the
ovary, unless mating occurs at which time the corpus luteum
becomes
the
major
producer
of
progesterone.
The
mural
granulosa cells and the vascularized theca cells within the antral
ovarian follicles are responsible for the enzymatic conversion of
cholesterol to its ultimate endpoint product estradiol. In addition
to steroidogenesis, these follicular cells also carry out the critical
missions of nurturing the enclosed growing oocyte, as well as
facilitating the process of ovulation, or expulsion of oocyte, and
subsequent formation of the ephemeral corpus luteum. Cyclic and
temporal
changes
in
expression
of
steroidogenic
pathway
proteins and other critically important ovarian genes known to
play critical roles in ovulation, oocyte development and corpus
luteum development and function are well known and may be
evaluated to provide information regarding ovarian function.
Understanding these molecular changes is vital for informing
female reproductive health during and after spaceﬂight.
To date, studies of ovarian function and fertility in mice exposed
to microgravity during NASA Space Shuttle ﬂights were of short
duration (<12 days) and, importantly, all included the effects of
live reentry prior to collection of tissues and analysis of animal
behavior3,7. Similarly, pregnant female rats ﬂown on Cosmos 1514
(1982), NASA-NIH Rodent (R)1 (STS-66 in 1994), and NASA-NIH R2
(STS-70 in 1995) were of short duration (4.5–11 days) and had live
animal return8–10. Notably, in the pregnant rats no effects of
spaceﬂight on healthy and atretic ovarian antral follicle popula-
tions, fetal wastage in utero, plasma concentrations of progester-
one and luteinizing hormone (LH) or pituitary content of follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) were noted8. Spaceﬂight, however,
signiﬁcantly
increased
plasma
concentrations
of
FSH
and
decreased pituitary content of LH analyzed postpartum (day
22–23;8). In these prior studies, it is not possible to separate the
effects of microgravity from that of reentry with the associated
hypergravity, turbulence, and the likely ensuing stress responses
linked to these events. Moreover, these studies while evaluating
maintenance of pregnancy, provide no information regarding the
fertility of these animals and their ability to exhibit normal estrous
cycles and ovarian function. The current investigation provides
insights into the endocrine status and ovarian cyclicity of female

the absence of reentry effects. Addressing the effects of extended
duration spaceﬂight on endocrine status are signiﬁcant and of
high impact to long-term female astronaut health before and after
ﬂight, interpretation of spaceﬂight ﬁndings derived from female
mice, and for long-term plans for multigenerational mammalian
studies in spaceﬂight.
RESULTS
Estrous cycle staging
Estrous cycle stage for each mouse was determined by three
independent investigators blinded to treatment group categories.
Figure 1 shows representative H&E stained cross sections of
vaginal wall tissue from the individual ﬂight and habitat control
animals following collection after the second carcass thaw during
March of 2016. Each stage of the estrous cycle is depicted in
Fig. 1. Proestrus is characterized by the presence of a thick layer
of stratiﬁed squamous epithelium, with an absence of luminal
cells and any corniﬁed epithelial cells (Fig. 1a). Estrous stage
animals exhibit a stratiﬁed squamous epithelium with a layer of
corniﬁed epithelial [red eosin stained cells above the nucleated
stratiﬁed squamous epithelial cells (Fig. 1b)]. Often, this corniﬁed
layer is delaminated from the underlying epithelial cells. In
metestrus, leukocytes appear and traverse the nucleated epithe-
lial layer to reach the delaminated mass of corniﬁed stratiﬁed
squamous epithelium in the lumen (Fig. 1c). During diestrus, the
vaginal wall is characterized by columnar muciﬁed cells next to a
thin layer of nucleated epithelium (Fig. 1d). Staging of the mice
indicated that the majority of the animals in the baseline control
group (6/9), the vivarium control group (5/8), and the ﬂight group
(6/10) were in estrus (Table 1). In comparison, habitat control
mice presented at all stages of the cycle in approximately equal
amounts (n = 2 or 3/stage). Flight group mice presented at estrus
(n = 6) and metestrus (n = 4; Table 1).
Ovarian RNA quality and tissue steroid levels
Ovarian RNA quality varied appreciably depending upon whether
it was ﬂash-frozen in LN or placed in RNAlater (Fig. 2).
Representative electropherograms from the Agilent 2100 are
shown for 2 mice collected in either RNAlater or LN. Overall, RNA
quality as determined by Agilent RNA integrity numbers (RIN
values) from tissues frozen in LN were greater (p < 0.05) in every
animal, and overall averaged around 5.71 ± 0.12 compared to
4.08 ± 0.11 for RNAlater preserved ovarian tissue (Fig. 2b). To
evaluate ovarian hormone production without access to serum,
whole ovarian tissue steroid levels were determined. Ovarian
tissue E2 levels were not signiﬁcantly different across experi-
mental groups (Fig. 3a). In contrast, whole ovarian tissue P4 levels
were signiﬁcantly lower in the habitat control (p = 0.005) and
ﬂight mice (p = 0.013) in comparison to baseline control mice
(Fig. 3b). Due to insufﬁcient animal numbers at individual stages
within treatment groups, we were unable to evaluate stage effects
alone and stage-treatment interactions.

function and steroidogenesis were compared across treatment

expression of any of the key enzymatic steps of steroidogenesis
or mitochondrial cholesterol uptake expression. Ovarian Cyp17a1
mRNA levels were elevated (p ≤0.05) in mice housed in the
habitat maintained on the ground (HC) when compared to
baseline and vivarium controls but were not different from ﬂight
animals that were housed in the habitat on the ISS (Fig. 4).
Analysis of other critically important ovarian genes involved in
steroidogenic production and action, including estrogen receptors
(Esr1 and Esr2), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (Scarb1),
luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) as well as oocyte-speciﬁc
proteins, growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9), zona pellucida
glycoprotein 3 (Zp3) showed no differences across the treatment
groups (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Comparison of ovarian gene expression at different stages of the
estrous cycle did not vary signiﬁcantly with exception of proestrus,
where
P450
aromatase
(Cyp19a1)
expression
was
elevated
(p ≤0.05) ~4-fold compared to all other stages (Fig. 5). Lastly, as
each group of animals had at least three animals staged at estrus,
we compared the gene expression across the four treatment
groups at this stage (Fig. 6). Levels of steroidogenic acute
regulatory protein (Star), P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage
(Cyp11a1), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b1), Cyp19a1,
and liver receptor homolog-1 (Nr5a2) expression did not change
appreciably across experimental conditions. Expression of Cyp17a1
under baseline and vivarium control conditions were signiﬁcantly
decreased (p < 0.05) compared to habitat control conditions (p <
0.05). Ovarian Cyp17a1 levels in ﬂight animals in estrus were not
notably different from estrus stage animals in the other experi-
mental conditions (Fig. 6). Examination of other critical ovarian
genes during estrus showed no signiﬁcant changes in expression
levels across control and ﬂight conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), a Validation mission launched aboard
SpaceX’s fourth cargo resupply mission, was the ﬁrst to transport
rodents to the International Space Station (ISS) in an unmanned
commercial vehicle. Lasting 37 days in microgravity, RR-1 was, at
the time, the longest space rodent study conducted by NASA. In-
ﬂight studies of RR1 mouse behavior and post-ﬂight physiology
revealed the Validation mice showed no overt physiological signs
of chronic stress or compromised health or welfare11. Moreover,
mice remained highly active and mobile throughout the experi-
ment, engaging in feeding, drinking, self-grooming, huddling,
and social interactions12. Our results provide detailed conse-
quences of long-term spaceﬂight microgravity on rodent estrous
cycle, ovarian steroidogenesis, and gene expression. Notably,
previous observations examining the potential impacts of micro-
gravity on ovarian function and its target tissue the uterus were of

a short-term nature and had the confounding effects of reentry
prior to tissue collection3,9,13. It is well known that estrous cycle
staging in female rodents can be inﬂuenced by a variety of factors
such as age, light, temperature, humidity, ambient noise, nutrition,
and social relationships14. Indeed, mice that are group housed
exhibit greater estrous cycle irregularities, than those individually
housed15,16. Nonetheless, many labs using contemporary strains of
mice are able to stage mice in group housing conditions, albeit it
may not be as ideal as single housed mice17–19. Again, group
housing was necessitated by animal husbandry concerns and
limitations of the NASA’s ﬂight hardware. Our results point to an
ability of female mice to exhibit estrous cycles after an extended
duration in space, as evidenced by our observation that ﬂight
animals exhibited two different stages of the cycle (estrus and
metestrus). Typically, under conditions of exogenous treatments/
stress, mice may exhibit constant vaginal estrus or an extended or
constant diestrus14,20, but not metestrus. In contrast to mice,
rats exhibit a greater synchrony when group housed, making it
difﬁcult to extrapolate ﬁnding across these two species21.
While measuring true estrous cyclicity in space is logistically
daunting due to the intensive daily monitoring required, we
posit that the analysis of the vaginal wall provides a robust
methodology that can indicate the estrous stage, and thus the
endocrine status of the animal at the moment of sacriﬁce. Indeed
the morphology of these twice frozen and thawed vaginal wall
tissues rivaled that of freshly isolated and ﬁxed tissues from
contemporary animals collected in our laboratory (data not
shown) and in those laboratories who pioneered the use of
vaginal wall histology as a mechanism to track cyclicity20,22,23.
Ovarian tissue steroid levels are also not commonly mea-
sured, as most investigators use serum levels of estrogen and
progesterone as a measure of ovarian steroidogenic activity.
Again, in animals exposed to microgravity, the ability to collect
serum at the time of sacriﬁce or longitudinally over time is
severely restricted logistically. We, therefore, analyzed whole
ovarian tissue levels of estrogen and progesterone. We detected
no striking difference in tissue estrogen concentrations across
the four treatment groups, and it should be noted that serum
estrogen levels in rodents also do not exhibit wide variations
across the cycle, often ranging from ND to 8–50 pg/ml in
total24–27. In contrast, we did observe that ﬂight and habitat
control animals had lower overall P4 levels in ovarian tissue.
One might predict this as these two groups had greater
numbers of mice in metestrus and diestrus, in total 4 and 5 for
ﬂight and habitat groups, respectively. During both of these
stages of estrous cycle the ovary has reduced steroidogenic
activity26–28. This was in contrast to the vivarium and baseline
control groups, which both had 8 animals each in proestrus and
estrus
in
total,
stages
associated
with
increased
ovarian
follicular steroidogenesis. We recognize that it would have
been ideal to examine the interaction of estrous cycle stage on
ovarian steroidogenesis as well as ovarian gene expression, but
due to the insufﬁcient numbers of animals at individual stages,
we were unable to do so. It is worth noting the experimental
design for RR1 as a hardware demonstration ﬂight determined
how tissues were preserved as well as group sizes and thus were
beyond our control. Whole ovarian gene expression analyses
were also dictated by the RR1 design. This type of analysis is
highly
confounded
as
whole
ovarian
tissue
contains
an
abundance of stromal tissue and smaller follicles, which
predominate over the few selected follicles that become highly
steroidogenic. Thus, when whole ovarian RNA is used, it was not
surprising
to
see
no
major
differences
in
ovarian
gene
expression across the treatment groups or even during different
stages of the cycle. Future studies need to take into considera-
tion this limitation, and collect and ﬁx tissues for analysis, so

they can be properly analyzed using in situ hybridization/
RNAscope and immunohistochemistry. Cyp17a1, the enzyme
located in the theca cell compartment of the ovarian follicle and
responsible for androgen production was elevated in the
habitat control animals. This difference was however, mani-
fested primarily in two of the three HC animals in estrus.
Safeguarding RNA tissue quality is acutely dependent on tissue
storage methods, which ideally would minimize RNase activity
throughout the process. Tissue collection and preservation during
spaceﬂight presents a unique challenge in the analysis of these
valuable specimens. Our current analyses of the right and left
ovaries processed in RNALater or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
(LN) indicated that LN preserved tissues always had greater RIN
values when compared to those of RNALater. Previous studies
utilizing RR1 RNAlater preserved spleen tissues showed higher RIN
values than those observed here29. This may be due to a time of
collection aspect with respect to spleen vs ovary following thawing
of the carcass, or just to tissue differences in RNA susceptibility to
the freeze/thaw. We note that freshly isolated ovarian tissues that
were snap-frozen in LN and then simultaneously processed with
the RR1 samples yielded RIN values >9.
In conclusion, our analyses of ovarian tissues and vaginal wall
tissues of mice exposed to extended periods of microgravity and
sacriﬁced in space indicate that these female mice were exhibiting
estrous cyclic activity. These studies point positively to the ability
of these animals to either continue or regain estrous cycle activity
during extended microgravity exposure. We posit that vaginal wall
estrous cycle activity be collected and provided to investigators to
include as covariate on all female mice used in future space
missions, much the same as weight and age. The current studies
also
provide
critical
logistical
information
regarding
tissue
collection, particularly for organs such as the ovary and uterus,
which are composed of highly dynamic tissues (follicles, corpora
lutea, endometrium), we recommend that they be preserved
primarily in ﬁxatives or in a manner where tissue/cell speciﬁc
aspects can be determined afterward. Lastly, the ability of these
females to exhibit estrous cycle activity provides a tractable
mammalian model system to test whether fertility is actually
impacted by microgravity. Reproductive cycles characterized by
alterations in hormone levels can exert signiﬁcant effects on
experimental outcomes, including emotion and the response to
environmental stressors30. Determining the effects of spaceﬂight
on estrous cyclicity is thus critical to making accurate interpreta-
tions of experimental endpoints for all spaceﬂight experiments
using female mice.
METHODS
Animals
Forty 12-week old C57BI/6J female mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME)
were selected based on similar body weights for 4 experimental groups
(16-week old at launch, n = 10/group): baseline control, vivarium control,
habitat control, and ﬂight. Flight mice were launched on SpaceX-4 (Rodent
Research 1) on September 21, 2014, as part of NASA’s Validation study.
Details of RR1 mission timeline (i.e., mouse pre-adaptation to cages, food)
as well as mouse spaceﬂight hardware details are available11,12,31. Brieﬂy,
vivarium control mice were maintained in standard mouse cages (5 mice/
cage) for the duration of spaceﬂight at Kennedy Space Center. Habitat
control mice were housed in a Rodent Research Transporter and Habitat
Hardware on Earth for durations consistent with ﬂight times at the same
density of mice as those in ﬂight (n = 10/habitat). The habitat control was
placed in the ISS Environmental Simulator at KSC on a 4-day delay to
mimic ﬂight temperature, CO2, and humidity conditions on the ISS for the
duration of spaceﬂight. Baseline control mice were euthanized one day
after launch and then partially dissected prior to freezing of the animal

carcasses mimicking the procedures to be conducted on ﬂight and for all
other animals at the conclusion of experiment. Flight mice were exposed
to microgravity for a total of 37 days (33 days on ISS and 4 days in the
Dragon Capsule). Mice were euthanized by injection of Euthasol followed
by cervical dislocation and immediately fast frozen intact (n = 8) or
partially dissected (n = 2) prior to carcasses being frozen. Mice carcasses
were frozen using pre-chilled Ice Bricks prior to transfer to the Minus Eighty
Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) aboard the ISS. All ground mice were
processed similarly. Flight mice carcasses returned to Earth February 2015
aboard the SpaceX CRS-5 and were then maintained along with the control
mice frozen at the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at the Ames
Research Center until dissection11. All animal procedures performed were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for
ﬂight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space
Center (KSC) and the methods were carried out in accordance with
relevant guidelines and regulations11.
Tissue collection
Female reproductive tissues (ovary and uterus) were collected from all
carcasses at about 35–45 min after removal from the −80 °C freezer. One
ovary was placed into RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA)
and the other was ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN). Similarly, the right
and left uterine horns were placed in RNAlater or snap-frozen in LN; uterine
tissues are part of an independent study by another investigator and will
not be further described here. Tissues preserved in RNAlater were kept at
4 °C for 2 days then frozen and stored at −80 °C, tissues snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen were also stored at −80 °C. Following primary tissue
dissections in April of 2015, the remaining carcass was refrozen and stored
at −80 °C. In March of 2016, carcasses were thawed again for a secondary
tissue dissection. At this time the combined cervix and vaginal wall were
dissected free of the pelvic cavity, and these tissues were ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Following overnight
ﬁxation these tissues were transferred to 70% EtOH, in preparation for
shipping to the University of Kansas Medical Center.
RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Ovaries tissues were transferred directly from RNAlater to tubes containing
1 ml of Trizol (Sigma) or 1 ml of Trizol was added directly to ovarian tissue
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were brieﬂy dissociated on ice
(3 bursts, 62 W) in a PowerGen 700 homogenizer (Fisher Scientiﬁc). RNA
was isolated from Trizol as per manufacturer protocol. To facilitate
precipitation 1 μL of glycogen (20ug/ul; Invitrogen) was added to aqueous
fraction and the resulting pellet was then resuspended in 15 μL of RNase
free water (ThermoFisher 18064022). An aliquot (1 μL) of this resuspended
RNA was used to determine RNA concentration and RNA integrity number
(RIN) values using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit and Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA (400 ng) from each sample
was reverse
transcribed
using
SuperScript
II
Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen/ThermoFisher) with random hexamer primers (IDT).
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using a 1:5 dilution of cDNA on
an Applied Biosystems HT7900 sequence detector. Genes interrogated
included 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b1), P450 cholesterol
side chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), 17α-hydroxylase (Cyp17a1), P450 aromatase
(Cyp19a1), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), liver receptor
homolog-1 (Nr5a2), estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1), estrogen receptor 2 (Esr2),
scavenger receptor class B member 1 (Scarb1), luteinizing hormone
receptor (Lhcgr), zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (Zp3), and growth
differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9). Primers were designed using Primer Express
3.0 (Applied Biosystems) and purchased from IDT (see Supplementary
Table 1). qPCR was performed for Hsd3b1, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1,
Nr5a2, Esr1, Esr2, Scarb1, Zp3, Lhcgr, and Gdf9 using PowerSYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). qPCR on Star, and 18 S rRNA levels were
determined using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) protocol and Applied Biosystems (Eukaryotic 18S rRNA
Endogenous Control [VIC® ⁄ MGB Probe, Primer Limited]) probes and
primers. Samples were run in triplicate, and the ΔΔCt method was used to
calculate the relative expression between the samples after normalization
with 18S levels. All SYBR Green reactions were evaluated for the presence
of a single dissociation curve, to conﬁrm the ampliﬁcation of a single
transcript and lack of primer dimers.

Histological analysis
Upon receipt of tissues from the BSP, the vaginal walls samples were
transferred to tissue embedding cassettes, and processed through a
standard series of dehydration steps prior to being embedded in parafﬁn.
Tissue blocks were then sectioned on a Leica microtome at a thickness of
6 μm and mounted on microscope slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Tissue sections were then deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin prior to histological examination. Slides were
randomized and sample (animal and treatment) labels were blinded
prior to examination by three independent reviewers for estrous cycle
staging (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, diestrus or not determinable). Non-
determinable samples were the result of tissues not containing sufﬁcient
vaginal wall tissue to yield reliable results. Following independent reviews,
those samples (~10%) without a consensus stage call were reevaluated by
the reviewers and a consensus stage agreed upon.
Radioimmunoassay
The steroid content (estrogen/progesterone) content of the ovary, as
determined by RIA, was used as a surrogate for serum analyses for
establishing the functional ovarian status of the RR1 females at the time of
their sacriﬁce. Flash frozen ovaries were halved and homogenized using a
sonicator in 200 μL of PBS. Homogenate was spun down at 10,000 × g for
5 min. Approximately 150 μL of supernatant was collected. 100 μL of
undiluted supernatant was shipped to the Ligand Assay and Analysis Core
(UVA School of Medicine) on dry ice and the rest were stored as 50 μL
aliquots at −80 °C. Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) were determined
by commercial ELISAs (E2: Calbiotech, El Cajon, CA. Cat # ES180S-100; P4:
IBL, Minneapolis, MN, Cat # IB79105). E2 assay characteristics were as
follows: sensitivity = 3 pg/ml; intra-assay coefﬁcient of variation (CV) =
7.5%; inter-assay CV = 10.1%. For P4, sensitivity = 0.15 ng/ml; intra-assay
CV = 6.5%; inter-assay CV = 10.3%.
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA was used to determine differences amongst treatment
groups (ﬂight status) or estrous cycle stage. Tukey’s mean separation tests
were used to determine differences between mean once a signiﬁcant
F-test was observed. All statistical analyses and graphs for the RIA were
performed using GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).
