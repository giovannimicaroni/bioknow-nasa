Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceﬂight; however, few studies have
focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in
socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to
hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of
females after HLU versus control females (n = 6–8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males (n = 5–6).
Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different
inrats ofeithersexfollowing HLU. ThelevelsofG protein-coupled estrogenreceptor (GPER)werelower
intheaorta ofSDfemalesexposedto HLUcomparedwith femalecontrolsbutwerenotaltered inmales.
HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic
dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-
hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females (n = 4 in each group)
suggestingthat lower GPER may contributeto arterialstiffening in thesettingofsimulated microgravity.
This study highlights sex-speciﬁc vascular adaptations to the state of simulated microgravity.
The cardiovascular adaptations in astronauts both during and after space-
ﬂight are variable in terms of sex, duration of exposure, and the model used
for the studies. Men and women have different recovery mechanisms from
stress factors, which can inﬂuence the response to the spaceﬂight
environment1. Though women are known to be protected against heart
disease prior to menopause, responses of the vascular system to spaceﬂight
are complicated by additional stress factors including microgravity, space
radiation, inactivity, or isolation. Few studies have focused on the sex dif-
ferences in the adaptations of the cardiovascular system to spaceﬂight in
spite of the fact that the proportion of women participating in space mis-
sions has reached about 10% and continues to increase2. The empirically
reported effects of spaceﬂight on the cardiovascular system are varied across
people who have been in space3. Some common short-term physiological
effects of spaceﬂight include changes in blood volume distribution and
alterations in baroreﬂex function3. Prolonged exposure to spaceﬂight also
impacts cardiovascular system including red blood cell count, systemic
vascular resistance, stroke volume, and cardiac output4–7. Sex-based differ-
ences in cardiovascular responses have been reported with changes in both
sexes occurring after several weeks in space1,8. Female astronauts experience
a greater loss of plasma volume while male astronauts appear to be more
prone to develop a spaceﬂight associated neuro-ocular syndrome
(SANS)9–11. Furthermore, following a 6-month spaceﬂight, women tended
to have greater increases in plasma renin and aldosterone versus men, while
both men and women experienced increased carotid artery stiffness5. The
observed sex differences underscore the importance of understanding the
underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular changes and sex-speciﬁc adap-
tations to both terrestrial and space-induced stressors important for the
development of personalized preventative countermeasures for astronauts.
To better understand the changes in cardiovascular adaptations in response
to spaceﬂight environment, terrestrial studies are focused on recapitulating

microgravity in human subjects with head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest or in
rodent models with hindlimb unloading (HLU)12,13. The mechanisms
underlying the cardiovascular systemresponses and arterial stiffness are not
well understood particularly in the female subjects. Furthermore, the
majority of HLU studies use male rodent subjects, with even fewer exam-
ining differences between sexes. Therefore, the present study investigated
the mechanisms underlying the development of central arterial stiffness in
female and male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats in response to HLU as an analog
for spaceﬂight-induced microgravity.
Results
Effect of HLU on body weight, organ weight
Thebodyweightofmalecontrolratswassigniﬁcantly(p < 0.05)greaterthan
thebodyweightoffemalecontrolrats(Fig.1).Similarly,maleHLUratswere
heavier than female HLU rats (Fig. 1). To account for this variability in body
weight while allowing for comparison between sexes, organ weights (heart,
kidney, pancreas, spleen, uterus) were normalized to individual tibia length
values that more accurately reﬂect physiological changes in organ weights14.
Body composition analysis revealed no differences in total fat mass between
study groups, however, control unexposed males had greater lean mass
comparedwithcontrolfemales(Fig.1).ExposuretoHLUreducedleanmass
in males (Fig. 1C). Lean-to-fat mass ratio was not different between study
groups (Fig. 1). Within each sex, HLU treatment did not affect organ
weights(Fig.1)excepttheheartswheremaleratsexposedto HLUhadlower
heart weight compared to the male control group (Fig. 1). HLU did not
affect uterine weight in female SD rats (Fig. 1).
Aortic PWV and cardiac function in response to HLU
TheeffectofHLUonPWVoftheaorticarchinmaleandfemaleSDratswas
determined (Fig. 2). HLU females had a greater aortic arch PWV compared
tocontrolfemalesorHLUmales(Fig.2).NodifferenceswerefoundinPWV
in HLU males compared with male controls (Fig. 2). HLU also increased
PWV of the left common carotid artery in the female rats compared to
female controls (Fig. S1). To determine whetherchanges in cardiac function
could explain differences in PWV caused by HLU exposure, systolic and
diastolicfunctionparametersweremeasuredinthefemalecontrolandHLU
rats. Stroke volume and cardiac output were not different between control
and HLU female groups (Fig. S2A, B). Although within normal ranges,
femaleHLUratshad increased ejection fractioncompared to controlfemale
rats (Fig.S2C). Diastolicfunction,measured byE/E’ratio was worse in HLU
female rats versus female controls (Fig. S2D).
Aortic extracellular matrix (ECM) and contractile components
α-smoothmuscle actinandmyosinwereassessedinthe media of aorticarch
of female and male rats following HLU exposure (Fig. 3). The aortas of male
controls had greater levels of both proteins compared to control females.
HLU had no effect on either α-smooth muscle actin or myosin in female or
male rats (Fig. 3). Collagen and elastin contents, and collagen-to-elastin
ratio were not different in control or HLU female or male rats (Fig. 4).
Collagen bundling in the aorta was measured by hue analysis to gain
understanding of the changes in collagen density after HLU and between
sexes (Fig. 5). Results were normalized to the number of total pixels.

green, with orange and yellow colors representing intermediary values (Fig.
5). Hue analysis determined collagen content based on standardized bin-
ning of colors as previously reported15,16. All groups followed a similar
collagen bundling pattern where prevalence of dense ﬁbers was the highest
while the prevalence of ﬁbers with loose collagen was the lowest (Fig. 5).
Female control rats had greater red collagen compared with male controls
(Fig. 5). However, HLU exposure did not inﬂuence the dense collagen ﬁbers
(red) in female rats in comparison to control females. Less bundled collagen
(yellow and green) was lower in female controls compared to male controls
(Fig. 5). HLU did not affect the prevalence of the loosely bundled collagen

dense collagen bundling (red) compared to all other groups (Fig. S3).
To determine the alignment of smooth muscle ﬁbers in the aorta, ﬁber
angle was assessed by CurveAlign software. Representative images of the
aorta from each group are shown on Fig. 6A. Various additional ECM

studied parameters in either male or female groups (Fig. 6B). No differences
were evident between sexes in control or HLU-treated groups (Fig. 6B).
The impact of HLU on aortic GPER
GPER staining in aortic media was lower in control males versus control
females. HLU reduced the levels of GPER in females versus control females.
No differences in aortic GPER were found in males in response to HLU

G1 effects on aortic PWV, injury markers, uterine weight
There were no differences in body weight or organ weights in G1 treated
female SD rats versus control SD females (Table 1). G1 administration
reduced aortic arch PWV in female rats exposed to HLU (Fig. 9A). No
difference in heart rate was evident in female rats after G1 treatment (Fig.
9B). The levels of 8-OHdG decreased following G1 treatment in HLU
female rats (Fig. 9C). No differences in p47phox or PPAR γ levels were
detected in HLU females after G1 treatment (Fig. 9D, E).
Multivariate data analysis
Figure 10 shows graphical representation of DCS analysis of variables
depicted in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 demonstrates differential variable rela-
tionships in male versus female SD rats independent of HLU exposure.
Several important relationships were identiﬁed in males versus females such
as oxidative stress markers with ECM characteristics (collagen content and
collagen ﬁber straightness), and arterial stiffness with COX-2 or eNOS.
However, in females, the strongest relationships were within body compo-
sition parameters; eNOS with lean mass, VSMC actin with elastin, and less
strong relationship between GPER with p47phox. These data suggest sex
differences in various relationships among variables independent of HLU
exposure. Table 3 shows differential variable relationships in control versus
HLU SD rats independent of sex. The strongest relationships were identiﬁed
between variables of body composition with arterial stiffness or with oxi-
dative stress in unexposed control rats. Independent of sex, PPARγ was
relatedtoVSMCactininunexposedcontrols.IntheHLUgroup,PPARγwas
related to collagen; while arterial stiffness - to body composition variables.

microgravity via HLU also demonstrated development of arterial stiffness.
However, few studies investigated sex differences and the potential sex-
speciﬁc mechanisms leading to arterial stiffness due to microgravity. As
space exploration continues to expand with longer and more distant mis-
sions, understanding the cardiovascular adaptations in female and male
astronauts will be crucial to ensure the long-term health and personalized
medical care for astronauts1. In this study, we investigated sex-speciﬁc
effects on the cardiovascular system in a rodent-based model of simulated
microgravity via 14 days of exposure to HLU17. The major ﬁndings of this
study are that female and male SD rats respond differently to HLU
demonstrating a greater arterial stiffness in females at the end of the
exposure compared with males. Increased arterial stiffness was accom-
panied by lower levels of aortic GPER and PPARγ and increased oxidative
stressmarkers (8-OHdG and p47phox) in femalesbutnotmalesafterHLU.
The females also exhibited diastolic dysfunction after HLU (males were not
evaluated in this experiment). Furthermore, administration of G1, an ago-
nist for the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER, reversed the HLU-
induced increase in PWV in female rats and decreased 8-OHdG, suggesting
that lower GPER in the setting of simulated microgravity contributes to
arterial stiffening. Our ﬁndings also suggest that the SD female rat is a

suitable model to study mechanisms underlying the development of arterial
stiffness in females in response to simulated microgravity.
It is well known that during spaceﬂight, the cardiovascular system
adapts to the state of microgravity by a variety of changes including redis-
tribution of blood ﬂow with ﬂuid shift towards the upper body and decrease
in venous return and resistance18. Sex differences were reported in the
adaptations of the cardiovascular system to spaceﬂight, however only a few
studies investigated the effects of microgravity on arterial stiffening by
including subjects of both sexes, and even fewer have made explicit side-by-
side comparisons between male and female subjects1,5,10,19–24. A few reports
also show conﬂicting results on whether arterial stiffness is reversible fol-
lowing the exposure to microgravity or HDT bed rest25,26. Furthermore, the
long-term consequences of the exposure to arterial stiffening are unknown
but may inﬂuence future abnormal hemodynamic responses to stressors
and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease particularly in older
females27–32. A greater aortic PWV in the female SD rats compared to males
after HLU suggests sex differences in the development of central arterial
stiffening following the exposure to simulated microgravity in this model.
PWV differs between women and men during various stages of life ranging
from lower baseline PWV in females versus males pre-puberty, similar
brachial-ankle PWV in both sexes during adulthood, and a greater increase
in PWV in females after menopause suggesting hormonal inﬂuences on
PWV33–35. Furthermore, women undergoing cardiac stress often experience
increased aortic wall thickness compared to men, highlighting a potential
increased susceptibility of females to developing arterial stiffness36. In con-
trast to other reports, our study did not ﬁnd changes in arterial stiffness in
male SD rats in response to HLU23. The response seen in SD rats may be
differentfromthoseseeninotherrodents.Furthermore,ithasbeenreported
that corticosterone levels are lower in resting male SD rats compared with
Wistar rats37, suggesting strain differences in the activity of hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis38. Since hormonal regulation of vasculature

underlies its response to stress, it is safe to assume that the response of male
Wistar rats could be exacerbated by greater resting activities of HPA and
corticosterone compared with male SD. Furthermore, the exposure length
to HLU, age of rats, and the differences in strain responses to stress may
explain the observed discrepancies. In addition, HDT bed rest is used to
study the responses of cardiovascular system to spaceﬂight. Sixty-day
exposure to HDT increasesblood pressure, reducesarterialcompliance,and
increases arterial stiffness measured by cardiac MRI during the HDT phase
in healthy subjects26. Surprisingly, another study using the same study
cohort found no differences in brachial-femoral pulse wave velocity, but a
tendency for an increase of the aortic cross-sectional area was evident
suggesting increased vascular ﬁlling39. The observed vascular changes
returned to baseline during the 4 days of recovery suggesting functional
mechanisms underlying arterial stiffening in this cohort26,39. Of note, no sex
effect was observed in these two studies potentially due to small sample
size26,39. The timing interval of pulse transition time was also decreased in
healthy male subjects after 60 day HDT protocol suggesting arterial
stiffening40. In contrast, increased aortic stiffening measured by carotid-
femoral pulse wave velocity did not completely recover after 1 month of
head-down bed rest in healthy men without cardiovascular risk41. Since
arterial stiffness may increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease,
understanding the mechanisms leading to arterial stiffening in response to
spaceﬂight may facilitate the development of countermeasures that can
improve the cardiovascular health of astronauts post-ﬂight.
The mechanisms of increased arterial stiffness due to microgravity are
not well understood. It has been suggested that arterial stiffness could be a
compensatorymechanismnecessarytomaintaincardiacoutputinresponse
to orthostatic stress after spaceﬂight26. Although we have not directly
measured total peripheral resistance, the increased stiffness in females was
associated with maintained cardiac output and stroke volume after HLU. In
addition, although there was a signiﬁcant increase in ejection fraction in
femalesafterHLU,theejectionfractionvalueswerewithinthenormalrange
for rats at this age. The signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings needs further inves-
tigation by examining the presence of subclinical left ventricle systolic
dysfunction using more advanced features of strain rate imaging42. In
contrast, we found a signiﬁcant increase in E/E’ ratio in female rats after
HLU suggesting diastolic dysfunction. These data are in agreement with
recent studies including the Framingham Heart Study that reported cor-
relations of arterial stiffness with left ventricular diastolic function43–45. It is
possible that increased aortic stiffness leads to left ventricular hypertrophy
followed by lower ﬁlling pressure and reduced coronary ﬂow45. Thus, the
increased E/E’ ratio in females after HLU in addition to greater left common
carotid artery stiffness in our study may indirectly suggest the reduction of
left ventricle ﬁlling pressure. Arterial stiffness, pulse pressure ampliﬁcation,
and augmentation index were greater in women versus men in the Cardi-
ovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study, where the authors
suggested that higher arterial stiffness may contribute to higher suscept-
ibilityofwomentodevelop heartfailurewithnormalejectionfraction46.The
return of cardiovascular system to normal functioning after spaceﬂight may
be delayed by lower vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries in those who
developed arterial stiffness emphasizing the need for longitudinal assess-
ment of sex-speciﬁc risk of cardiovascular events in astronauts with arterial
stiffness following long-term spaceﬂights47,48. In addition, other hemody-
namic variables such as blood pressure can inﬂuence the extent of arterial
stiffness. Higher blood pressures were reported in male SD or male Wistar
rats compared to controls after 14 days of HLU49,50. Therefore, it is possible
that the response of blood pressure after HLU was different in male versus
female SD rats contributing to differences in PWV. Our future studies will
incorporate blood pressure measurements during HLU exposure to estab-
lish the interactions of estrogen receptors and arterial hemodynamics.
Changes in mechanical forces (shear stress and pressure) or ECM
composition are important for the regulation of aortic vascular smooth
muscle cell (VSMC) support of the arterial compliance and the response of
VSMC to increases in blood volume or pressure51. We investigated the
alterations in ECM components as a potential contributor to increased
PWV. Male rats had greater expression of aortic α smooth muscle actin and
myosin, however no differences in these cytoskeletal elements were detected
in either female or male rats after HLU. In contrast, lower expression of α
smooth muscle actin with potential switch to synthetic phenotype was
reported in cerebral arteries suggesting vessel-speciﬁc alterations in cytos-
keleton in response to HLU52.
An increase in collagen cross-linking and deposition and decrease in
elastin content may also lead to increased aortic stiffness and lower arterial
compliance. Our ﬁndings reveal no differences in collagen content after
14 days of HLU. These data are consistent with reports demonstrating that
structuralremodelingmaynotbetheprimarymechanismleadingtoarterial
stiffness in astronauts after spaceﬂights25 suggesting that other factors such
as systemic (neurohumoral) or local endothelial factors may have an impact
on the development of arterial stiffness5,23. However, others reported that
HLU resulted in increased deposition of extracellular collagen in the basilar
artery but not femoral artery in rats53. The hydroxyproline content as a
measure of collagen content was increased in male Wistar rats, however
collagen subtype composition was not different between control and HLU-
exposed rats in this cohort23. These studies suggest that hypertrophic
response to HLU is vascular bed speciﬁc. Furthermore, our data revealed no
differences in ﬁber characteristics including alignment, straightness, length,
or width suggesting that 14-day exposure to HLU does not induces changes
in collagen ﬁber characteristics in SD rats. This was a surprising ﬁnding
considering a possibility of an increased stress on collagen ﬁbers and their
potential gradual strengthening under pressure due to HLU54. Increased
stiffness of collagenﬁbers mayalso affect smooth muscle cell phenotype,cell
proliferation, or cause downregulation of vascular contractility55,56.

Increased ﬁber angle may indicate greater alignment between smooth
muscle ﬁbers potentially contributing to increased stiffness57. Furthermore,
highly dense and stiff matrices can promote crosstalk between estrogen
receptors and prolactin supporting the hypothesis that changes of the
physical environment, such as in microgravity, can be affected by estrogen
receptors58. Unlike collagen, another major ECM protein, elastin, is
responsible for elasticity, reversible expansion and relaxation of large
arteries59. Despite elastin being a critical component of the aorta’s ability to
deform under stress, few studies have investigated elastin in response to
HLU exposure. No statistically relevant differences in elastin expression or
collagen-to-elastin ratio were found in either female or male rats after HLU
exposure. However, the female HLU group had a wide standard deviation
which consisted of several subjects having decreased elastin expression after
HLU exposure compared to the mean. For those individuals, the cause of
decreased elastin after HLU exposure is unclear. Elastin in the aorta could
decrease with age or in the setting of arterial stiffness. However, similar to
our study, aortic elastin content was not altered in male Wistar rats
after HLU23.
Sex differencesin the cardiovascular system may depend in part on the
levels of sex hormone receptors and signaling induced by their actions. In
non-pregnant female mice, aortic PWV was reported to be lower in estrus
cycle compared with diestrus suggesting that the development of vascular
stiffening may in part be inﬂuenced by the levels of ovarian hormones60.
Indeed, our preliminary data agrees with previous reports suggesting that
the removal of sex hormones via ovariectomy increases arterial stiffening in
the female rats. Furthermore, our preliminary studies show that HLU did
not change PWV in aorta or carotid artery of ovariectomized rats (Fig. S4).
Similarly, ovariectomy did not exacerbate muscle loss in Fisher female rats
during the exposure to either simulated microgravity or partial-gravity
environments61. These data together with our ﬁndings suggest that the
activation of local vascular estrogen receptors may have a greater impact on
the development of arterial stiffness after HLU than changes in the ovarian
hormones. Furthermore, arterial stiffness is associated with genetic variants
of estrogen receptor subtypes suggesting a link betweenarterial stiffness and
estrogen receptors expression62. Although the data on the status of estrogen
receptors in response to spaceﬂight or microgravity analogs are limited,
Holets et al. reported a downregulation of estrogen receptor α mRNA and
protein in the uterus and ovary of mice after the spaceﬂight63. However, to
our knowledge the response of GPER to HLU in the aorta or other tissues
was not yet been considered particularly in the context of sex differences.
GPER is a membrane-bound estrogen receptor with protective actions in
the cardiovascular system64. GPER is widely expressed in tissuesthroughout
the body of both sexes65. Our data showed sex differences in aortic GPER
levels between unexposed animals. However, this difference was lost when
GPER decreased in the females after HLU. In addition, our data revealed a
strong relationship between aortic pulse-wave velocity and GPER in males.

In agreement with previous reports, G1 administration reduced aortic
pulse-wave velocity demonstrating a protective role of GPER activation
against arterial stiffening66–71. Recent preclinical studies highlighted a pro-
tective role of GPER in the regulation of blood pressure, diastolic function,
vascular reactivity, arterial stiffness, and aortic remodeling66–71. In contrast,
the knockout of GPER in male mice increased endothelial prostanoid-
mediated vasoconstriction of the thoracic aorta without changing eNOS
mRNA levels or eNOS activity72. In addition, the intracarotid pulse wave
velocities were similar between male and female GPER knockout mice,
however the response to angiotensin II showed greater increases in elastin
and smooth muscle but less collagen deposition in male GPER knockout
mice versus females revealing sex differences in vascular remodeling67.
Aorticpulse-wavevelocityinHLUmaleswasalsocorrelated withheart
weight. Indeed, heart weight was lower in male SD after HLU, but did not
change in females. The mechanisms and consequences of reduced heart
weight in SD HLU male rats are unknown, while cardiac atrophy was
suggested to contribute to the reductions in cardiac function after
spaceﬂight18. Furthermore, although estrogen has an established role in the
regulation of adiposity, the effect of GPER deletion on body weight revealed
contrasting results with studies reporting increased or decreased body
weight in GPER knockout mice versus control counterparts73,74. Our data
showed no changes in body weight, fat mass or lean mass in females after
HLU, however similar to other reports, HLU decreased lean body mass in
male SD rats75. In addition, there was strong correlation between body
weight and lean body mass in both sexes. These changes appeared to be
unrelated to GPER as no relationship between lean mass and GPER was
detected. Fat mass however was not different among studied groups
potentially due to small number of subjects used for this analysis which led
to large data variability in female controls and male subjects. Future studies
using GPER knockout mice of both sexes could provide more insight on the
role of GPER in vascular adaptations to HLU.
Since GPER actions has been linked to antioxidant effects in cardio-
vascular system65,76, we tested the levels of oxidative stress markers in the
aorta of female versus male rats following HLU. Our data showed increased
levels of DNA damage marker 8-OHdG in the aorta of HLU females but not
in male rats suggesting increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, the absence
of differences in the levels of lipid peroxidation marker 4-HNE suggests a
more pronounced DNA damage77. In agreement, a 72-h exposure to
simulated microgravity through a rotary cell culture system resulted in
increased expression of the DNA damage markers in human promyelocytic
leukemia cells78. Previous reports also demonstrated increased circulating
levels of 8-OHdG in rats after HLU, in human patients with cardiovascular
disease, as well as in patients with diabetes where higher 8-OHdG was
positively correlated with PWV79–81. Lower levels of antioxidant enzymes
catalase and glutathione peroxidase were reported in skeletalmuscle of male
SD rats after 28 days of HLU suggesting that lower activity of antioxidant
enzymes may also contribute to the increase of superoxide levels after
HLU82. The correlations of 8-OHdG with collagen and to a lesser degree
with elastin in our study suggest that long-term exposure to oxidative stress
could promote ECM remodeling and further exacerbate aortic stiffening in
response to HLU83. Furthermore, the reduction of pulse wave velocity by G1
administration in HLU females was accompanied by decreased 8-OHdG
suggesting that the protective actions of GPER may involve reduction of
vascular oxidative stress70. These data agree with previous reports demon-
strating antioxidant effects of GPER activation in various tissues including
aorta of hypertensive rats where 2-week administration of G1 reduced lipid
peroxidation68. Although the major strength of our studies was a compar-
ison between female and male SD rat responses to HLU, G1 treatment
experiments were performed only in female rats, thus sex speciﬁc responses
to G1 were not established; thus, future studies should also consider the
response of male SD subjects to G1 activation in the setting of HLU.
A crosstalk between GPER and PPARγ in anti-inﬂammatory protec-
tion against global cerebral ischemia has been suggested in ovariectomized
rats84. PPARγ is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in
estrogen-based protection of the cardiovascular and renal systems85,86.
PPARγ is also closely linked to cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction
and therefore has the potential for being targeted by HLU which induces
cardiovascular changes similar to aging or menopause87. Our data revealed
lower PPARγ levels in the aorta of female rats in response to HLU88, as well
asa correlationof PPARγwithcollagencontentinHLUaortas.Considering
the role of PPARγ in the regulation of vasodilation, vascular redox state,
bioavailability of nitric oxide, as well as regulation of VSMC stiffness89, our
data implies that lower PPARγ may result in reduced protection against
arterial stiffness caused by the exposure to HLU. Indeed, the activation of
PPARγ by pioglitazone attenuated arterial stiffness and obesity-induced
elastin ﬁber fragmentation in perivascular adipose tissue of diabetic mice
suggesting that protective effects of PPARγ against arterial stiffening may
involve ECM remodeling mechanisms90. Furthermore, we investigated the
expression patterns of CD68-positive macrophage/monocytes, eNOS and
COX-2 in the aorta after HLU. The eNOS regulation in the vasculature in
response to HLU may depend on the vascular bed or the length of the
exposure47,91. Lower nitric oxide availability due to formation of peroxyni-
tritehas beensuggested as a contributing factor to superoxide production in
vasculature afterHLU92. However, our data revealedno differencesin eNOS
or COX-2 among studied groups. Future studies will assess nitric oxide
bioavailability and aortic vascular reactivity in response to nitric oxide and
COX-2 inhibition to determine if functional vasodilatory responses are
altered in female rats after HLU. Although no differences in eNOS levels
were detected in male aortas, there was a strong correlation between eNOS
and ECM in male SD suggesting a potential inﬂuence of eNOS on ECM
remodeling.However,asmallsamplesizeintheanalysisofimmunostaining

detect signiﬁcant effects between study groups. The use of multivariate
analysis of data provided additional insights on potential relationships
between studied variables; thus, strengthening the conclusions of this study.
Finally, the mechanisms and long-term consequences of arterial stiff-
ness developed in response to spaceﬂight are not well understood. The
present study demonstrated sex differences in the development of arterial
stiffening in SD rats exposed to simulated microgravity. Although the cel-
lular mechanisms of the interaction between microgravity, the cardiovas-
cular system and estrogen receptors in response to HLU need further
investigation,ourstudyrevealed thatlowerGPER inthefemalescontributes
to the development of arterial stiffness during HLU, and that the SD rat is a
suitable model to study these interactions. Furthermore, multivariate sta-
tistical analysis identiﬁed several signiﬁcant relationships between studied
variables based on sex or the exposure to HLU that could be explored in
future studies focused on the development of destiffening agents as a
countermeasure for arterial stiffness.
Methods
Animals
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mitteeof theWakeForest UniversitySchoolofMedicine(A21-039).Female
and male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories(Wilmington,MA,USA).Allratswerehousedat12:12-hlight-
dark cycle, a constant room temperature and humidity. A standard rodent
chow (Lab Diet 5P00 - Prolab RMH 3000, PMI Nutrition International,
INC, Brentwood, MO) and water were given ad libitum throughout the
experimental protocols.
Study timeline
SociallyandsexuallymaturefemaleandmaleSDratsat20weeksofagewere
randomly assigned to study groups. The ﬁrst experimental set included the
following animals: female control (F), female HLU (F HLU), male control
(M), or male HLU (M HLU) (n = 5–8 in each group). HLU groups
underwent hindlimb unloading for 14 days93. Control groups were exposed
to the same cages for a 14-day period. On the morning of day 14, animals
were imaged with ultrasound followed by EchoMRI, and then sacriﬁced to
collect tissues. Additional experimental set included two groups of HLU
female rats that underwent either treatment with G1, a G protein-coupled

estrogen receptor (GPER) agonist (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) or
vehicle (n = 4 in each group). G1 was dissolved in 50% dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) at a dose of 100 μg/kg/day. G1 or vehicle was delivered via osmotic
minipumps to female HLU rats for 3 weeks (model 2ML2; Alza Corp., Palo
Alto, CA)94. Pumps were implanted subcutaneously on the back of the rat’s
neck 1-week prior to HLU exposure and continued for 2 weeks during the
HLU exposure. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and injury markers were
analyzed at the end of the 3-week treatment with G1.
Hindlimb unloading (HLU)
To determine the effects of microgravity, 20-week-old male and female SD
ratsweresuspendedbythetailviaHLUfor14daysresultinginahead-down
body angle of 30–35 degrees. Age-matched, non-suspended controls
remained in similar cages93. Animals were monitored for signs of distress by
monitoring food and water intake and loss of body weight throughout the
exposure to HLU.
Ultrasound assessment of arterial stiffness
Rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (1.5%) and placed on a temperature-
controlled platform. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate were mon-
itored throughout the imaging protocol. Hair was removed from the
thoracic and neck areas of rats with a depilatory cream prior to imaging.
Pulse wave velocity (PWV) of the aortic arch and common carotid arteries
were determined in male and female rats using a MS250 transducer and
high-resolution ultrasound imaging system Vevo 2100 LAZR (FujiFilm,
VisualSonics).MS250transduceroperatesatafrequencyof13–24 MHzand
axial resolution of 75/165. The PWV of the aortic arch and carotid arteries
was measured by the following equation: the D (mm), distance from
ascending to descending artery measured with tracing tool (Vevo Lab
software), divided by time interval, Δt, which represent the difference
between t2 and t1 (ms). Time intervals between the R-wave of the ECG to
the foot of the Doppler waveforms were averaged over at least three cardiac
cycles. The foot of the Doppler waveform was deﬁned manually as the
intersection between the baseline and the beginning of the ascending or
descending aortic velocity, or proximal and distal segments of the common
carotid artery. The pulse-transit time in the aortic arch was calculated by
subtracting the mean ascending aorta (t1) time interval from the mean
descending aorta (t2) time interval. For common carotid arteries, t1 time
interval was recorded from the proximal portion of the artery and t2 time
interval was recorded from distal portion of the artery. All ultrasound
measurements were done by one operator, blinded to the experimental
groups.
Ultrasound assessment of diastolic function
Left ventricle M-mode images were recorded in the short-axis parasternal
view. The ejection fraction (EF) was calculated as %EF = ((left ventricle end-
diastolicvolume(LVEDV) −leftventricularend-systolicvolume(LVESV)/
LVEDV) × 100. Stroke volume (SV) was determined as SV = (LVEDV −
LVESV) µl. Cardiac output (CO) was determined as cardiac output
(CO) = heart rate (HR) × SV/1000 ml/min. Mitral inﬂow measurements of
early- (Emax) and late (Amax) ﬁlling velocities were acquired from an apical
four-chamber heart orientation using pulsed wave Doppler with the sample
volume placed at the tips of mitral leaﬂets. The mitral valve septal annular
velocities (E′) were also assessed by Doppler tissue imaging from the four-
chamberview69.AratioofE/E’wascomputedasameasureofleftventricular
end-diastolic pressure. Greater E/E’ suggests higher left ventricular end-
diastolic pressure. All measured and calculated systolic and diastolic indices
are represented as the average of at least three consecutive cardiac cycles.
Body composition
EchoMRITM Analyzer was used to determine the total body composition in
studied groups. Brieﬂy, animal was placed in a clear holder, and then
inserted into the EchoMRI Analyzer without anesthesia. Each animal was
scanned three times in a row and the average total body fat and lean mass
were recorded.
Collagen content
Aortas were ﬁxed in formalin and ethanol followed by the parafﬁn-
embedding. Aortic sections were cut at thickness of 5 µm. Collagen content
was determined by Masson’s trichrome staining (Abcam ab150686). Using
a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT equipped with NDP.scan and
NDP.view, slides containing stained aortic sections were imaged at ×20
magniﬁcation.UsingAdobePhotoshop7.0,eachslidewasquantiﬁedforthe
total area of collagendeposition (red, orange, yellow, or green) and reported
as a collagen-to-tissue ratio.
Collagen ﬁber properties
Fiveµmsectionswerestained withPicrosiriusred(Sigma-Aldrich,St.Louis,
MO;assaycomponentsCat#:197378-100G;P6744-16A;36-554-8)toassess
collagen ﬁber properties. Slides were imaged using polarized light, and
90 × 90 µm representative regions of interest (ROIs) were selected around
aortic arch to determine collagen ﬁber bundling, length, width, straightness,
and alignment. Collagen bundling was assessed using an R script that
binned hue values in each ROI into red, orange, yellow, and green, in order
of high to low collagen bundling15. Data was presented as a ratio of the
binned values to the total number of pixels binned.
Collagen ﬁber length, width, and straightness were determined
through CT-FIRE software (Laboratory for Optical and Computational
Instrumentation, The University of Wisconsin-Madison) using default
settings95. Coefﬁcient of alignment was determined through CurveAlign
software (Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, The
University of Wisconsin-Madison), using default settings95.
Smooth muscle ﬁber characterization
Extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristics were analyzed using MATLAB
and the CT-FIRE algorithm to assess ﬁber straightness, ﬁber length, and
ﬁber width. Fiber angle was quantiﬁed at the individual ﬁber level. CT-FIRE
excludes empty pixels prior to analysis. Quantiﬁcation of ﬁbers was done
using CT-FIRE and Curve Align scripts15.
Elastin ﬁber content
Verhoeff’s stain (AmericanMasterTech; Cat#:KTVEL) wasused to quantify
elastin content in aortic sections using the manufacturer’s protocol. The
staining intensity in the tunica media layer of the aorta was normalized to
the intensity of the background and to the maximal value of 255 of the red,
green, and blue intensity (RGB) component and reported as relative
intensity units96.
Morphological, inﬂammatory, and oxidative stress markers
Tissues were ﬁxed in 10% formalin followed by 70% ethanol, embedded in
parafﬁn, and cut into 5 µm sections. Immunostaining was performed using
the avidin biotin complex (ABC) method with 0.1% diaminobenzene
solution used as the chromogen as previously described. Antigen retrieval
treatment with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was applied at 90–95 °C for
30 min. Non-speciﬁc binding was blocked in a buffer containing 10%
normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 30 min. Aortic sections were
incubated with goat anti-α-smooth muscle actin (1:500 dilution; Novus
Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA; Cat#: NB300-978), rabbit anti-smooth
muscle myosin heavy chain 11 (1:500 dilution; Abcam, Waltham, MA,

and secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit, mouse or goat antibodies (1:500
dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were scanned
witha Hamamatsu Nanozoomer2.0 HT utilizingNDP.scan and NDP.view
as the imaging software at ×20 magniﬁcation. Images were analyzed in four
ﬁelds per aortic cross-section using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 by the investi-
gator blinded to the experimental groups. The staining was normalized to
the intensity of the background and to the maximal value of the RGB
component and reported as relative intensity units as described96.
Statistics
Groups were compared using one-way or two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post hoc tests (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcantly
different. All data were presented as mean ± SEM.
Discrete correlate summation (DCS) analysis
The microgravity and sex discrete correlate summation (DCS) analysis is
designed to create an indexed network for the visualization of binary inter-
action of variables with large differences in sex-wise correlations given this
model of microgravitational challenge and a microgravitational-wise corre-
lations independent of sex. DCS analysis was performed on the 18 variables
(Heart/TL, Kidney/TL, BW, % Fat AVE, % Lean mass AVE, COX-2, eNOS,
GPER, PPARγ, VSMC actin, 8-OHdG, p47phox, TC, VVG, Carotid PWV,
Aorta PWV, CF length, CF straightness). Brieﬂy, absolute values of both the
log correlation ratios (logcr) of male versus female (for control and HLU
groups, log(malep/femalep)) and the log correlation ratios of HLU versus
control(forfemaleandmalegroups,log(HLUp/controlp))werecalculatedfor
each variable combination97. To ﬁnd large differences between the sex-wise
and microgravity-wise correlations (153 combinations from each DCS ana-
lysis), we performed these analyses to isolate correlations of interest; 68
combinations (|logcr| ≥0.8) were further evaluated after tabulating and
indexing by DCS; |logcr| values range from 0.8 to 4.42 or 6.3-fold to 27,000-
fold change in p values. For network visualization purposes 8-OHdG and
p47phox were combined into an oxidative stress node, VSMC actin, TC,
VVG, CF length and CF straightness were combined into an extracellular
matrix composition node and Heart/TL, Kidney/TL, BW, % Fat AVE and %
Lean mass AVE were combined into a body composition node.
The 68 above |logcr| ≥0.8 edges were plotted with the corresponding
variable nodes in Fig. 10. Nodes and edges also illustrated in Tables 2 and 3.
All calculations were performed in Excel (Microsoft Corp., WA), Prism
(GraphPad Software, MA) was used for statistical analyses and plotting data
in ﬁgures; Cytoscape was used for network generation.
