The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby
constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large
number of important signals pass. Throughout their history of discovery and description,
the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that
the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-speciﬁc func-
tions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting
that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over
evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-speciﬁc expression.
This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence
diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here
some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set
of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among
14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional
speciﬁcities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis.The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity
and speciﬁcity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and
be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving
14-3-3s will continue to address speciﬁcity in experimental design and analysis.

INTRODUCTION
The 14-3-3s are a family of regulatory proteins that is present in all
eukaryotes and involved in protein interactions mediating signal
transduction pathways. Numerous pathways and processes rely
on the 14-3-3 interactions to regulate key metabolic points (e.g.,
Aitken et al., 1992; Ferl, 1996; Finnie et al., 1999; Fulgosi et al.,
2002). The conservation of 14-3-3 structure among eukaryotes
speaks to their essential nature, yet the divergence into so many
isoforms in each of these species suggests an intricate network
of roles for these proteins (e.g., Rosenquist et al., 2000; Roberts
and de Bruxelles, 2002; Sehnke et al., 2002b). Most plants have
about a dozen 14-3-3 genes that provide sequence and functional
diversity potentially leading to specialized structures and functions
within the various members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. That
diversity can be enlarged by selective phosphorylation of 14-3-3s
at several known sites across the protein, sites that are variously
retained among the isoforms. The purpose of this paper is to
examine the evolutionary and biochemical diversity of 14-3-3s
and question whether this diversity has any intrinsic biochemical,
cellular, or physiological signiﬁcance; then present approaches to
answer that question.
14-3-3s are by far the major, most numerous phosphopro-
tein interaction proteins in plants (e.g., Ferl, 1996, 2004; Ferl
et al., 2002; Chevalier et al., 2009; Gokirmak et al., 2010; Deni-
son et al., 2011). This fact alone puts 14-3-3s among the most
important interaction nodes in the Arabidopsis interactome
(Braun et al., 2011). The 14-3-3s interact with phosphorylated
peptide sequences through sequence-speciﬁc motifs RSxpSxP,
RSxxpSxP, and YpT, among others (Aitken et al., 1992; Dubois
et al., 1997a; Yaffe et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2001; Ferl et al.,
2002; Shen et al., 2003). The phosphorylated serine or threo-
nine forms both hydrogen and ionic bonds with highly conserved
residues found in the basic binding pocket of the 14-3-3 protein.
In vertebrate isoform 14-3-3τ, these residues are located at K49,
R56, and R127 (Muslin et al., 1996). Binding can also occur with
non-phosphorylated sequences, such as GHSL (Andrews et al.,
1998) and WLDLE (Petosa et al., 1998). These diverse binding
sequences permit the 14-3-3 proteins to participate in a wide range
of phosphorylation-based signaling pathways. Some examples in
plants include red light signaling, immunity-associated cell death,
abiotic stress response, ATP synthase activity in both mitochon-
dria and chloroplasts, and nitrate reductase activity regulation
(Ferl et al., 1994; Jarillo et al., 1994; Bunney et al., 2001; Pozuelo
et al., 2001; Folta et al., 2008; Oh et al., 2010).
We consider that, in many signaling systems,14-3-3s serve
to complete the phosphorylation-based, signal-induced changes
in their client proteins, and that the binding of 14-3-3s ﬁnal-
ize the signaling event by enabling a change in client confor-
mation, activity, localization, or the association of the client
within a larger protein complex (Sehnke et al., 2002a; Figure 1).

FIGURE 1 | Function of 14-3-3s. The basic 14-3-3-mediated regulation of
client activity is a two-step process whereby the target protein is ﬁrst
phosphorylated by a speciﬁc kinase. This creates a recognition site for the
binding of dimeric 14-3-3 proteins, which can have a number of different
effects on client activity. Each 14-3-3 monomer can bind to different sites
on the same client protein or each can bind different client proteins. 14-3-3s
may themselves be phosphorylated (as indicated by “?”) although the
effects on client binding are not well understood.
This consideration, that 14-3-3s should serve major phosphor-
signaling roles, helps set the stage for the major hypothesis under
discussion in this paper. With so many potential roles and many
14-3-3 family members what range of speciﬁcities among family
members might be expected with regard to biological functions of
14-3-3s?
14-3-3 PRIMARY SEQUENCE EVOLUTION
The 14-3-3s are considered to be a well conserved protein fam-
ily, yet some areas of the proteins have undergone diversiﬁcation.
The number of isoforms present differs among species. Thir-
teen expressed isoforms are present in Arabidopsis, seven are
present in many animals, and two are present in yeast (Ferl, 1996;
van Heusden et al., 1996; DeLille et al., 2001; Aitken, 2006;
Schoonheim et al., 2007; Li and Dhaubhadel, 2011). Amino acid
identity is conserved to a reasonable degree within the entire fam-
ily across species and across most of the protein (Comparot et al.,
2003; Bridges and Moorhead, 2005; Lottersberger et al., 2006;
Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008; see Figure 2).
Sequence alignment of the thirteen 14-3-3 proteins from Ara-
bidopsis allows the visualization of regions of that have been
conserved or have diverged over evolutionary time. These regions
can also be overlain onto a structural model to help predict regions
that may be important structurally or functionally (Figure 3).
Although there are regions that show high conservation across all
isoforms, it is apparent that there are certain sub-groupings of
isoforms that show greater sequence similarity to each other. Con-
servation patterns can be logically classiﬁed along well-supported
evolutionary lineages which may imply a specialization-driven
divergence (Ferl et al., 1994). This potentially suggests that selec-
tion pressures are present in the family due to their involvement
in specialized function and complex formation (Rosenquist et al.,
2001), but this is a suggestion based on divergence branching pat-
tern and not on the acquisition or loss of known functionalities.
Plant 14-3-3s can be divided into two main subgroups, the ε and
non-ε groups (DeLille et al., 2001; Sehnke et al., 2002b; Yao et al.,
2007; Li and Dhaubhadel, 2011). The non-ε group can be fur-
ther subdivided, with four of these groupings occurring in the
last 170 million years (Piotrowski and Oecking, 1998; Vision et al.,
2000; Rosenquist et al., 2001). Additionally, the ε group tends to
have deep branching in all plant species (Piotrowski and Oecking,
1998), suggesting that ε isoforms retain ancestral protein func-
tion (Wang and Shakes, 1996). The presence of multiple isoforms,
however, leads to the question of functional differences. Are these
different isoforms performing different cellular functions? Or do
these proteins act redundantly as backups to perform these vital
functions?
Speciﬁcity among 14-3-3s does not appear to be associated
with phylogenetic speciation. After consideration of 14-3-3 evolu-
tion in plants, there emerges no compelling case for speciﬁcity
that is based on evolutionary lineages alone. There has been
no evolutionary premise that has led to the discovery of spe-
ciﬁc biochemical interaction or cellular function among plant
14-3-3s. There are divergences that track evolutionary change, cer-
tainly, but no speciﬁc lineages have been associated with speciﬁc
functions.
14-3-3 PHOSPHORYLATION
Phosphorylation events having a physiologically relevant impact
on 14-3-3s have been identiﬁed in both plants and animals under
certain conditions, but there is not yet a cohesive model for the
role phosphorylation plays in deﬁning functional speciﬁcity. How-
ever, known phosphorylation sites are not universally conserved in
14-3-3s, making phosphorylation an event that could mark certain
isoforms for certain functionalities.
A number of phosphorylation events been reported in mam-
malian 14-3-3s at S58, S64, S132, S185, T233, and Y179 (Aitken
et al., 1995; Dubois et al., 1997a,b; Furlanetto et al., 1997; Megidish
et al., 1998; Gringhuis et al., 2005). Some of these sites are not con-
served across all isoforms allowing potential for speciﬁc effects.

undergone over evolutionary time. Views are angled with perspectives
shown in lower left corners, with monomers in orange and blue. Residue
conservation is highest in the client binding channel, which is exposed

according to the degree of conservation determined with ConSurf
(bottom panel). Residues predicted to have roles in 14-3-3 structure
(conserved and buried) and function (conserved and exposed) are
annotated below the sequence. Exposed and buried residues were
determined using a neural network algorithm. Residues for which there
was insufﬁcient data (present in less than 10% of isoforms) are indicated in
yellow. Positions of the nine alpha-helices are indicated below the sequence.

14-3-3 Isoform functional speciﬁcity
For example, the S58 phosphorylation site is not conserved in the
14-3-3σ and 14-3-3τ isoforms. 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ζ appear to be
the only 14-3-3s phosphorylated at S185 in vivo even though two
other isoforms contain a serine residue at this site. Furthermore,
this phosphorylation event has only been detected in brain and
not in other tissues (Aitken et al., 2002).
The ﬁrst report of phosphorylation of a plant 14-3-3 protein
was the demonstration that 14-3-3ω can be phosphorylated in
vitro (Lu et al.,1994). Since then, a number of large scale phospho-
proteomics studies have identiﬁed plant 14-3-3 proteins in their
screens using mass spectrometry, including gravity responses in
Arabidopsis (Barjaktarovic et al., 2009) and seed development in
oilseed rape (Agrawal and Thelen, 2006). A recent study in Ara-
bidopsis found evidence for phosphorylation of several isoforms
at different sites at the C-terminus of the proteins. This is a region
of very low sequence conservation (Figures 2 and 3) providing
the potential for phosphorylation to affect 14-3-3s in an isoform-
speciﬁc manner (Sugiyama et al., 2008; Reiland et al., 2009). Three
Arabidopsis 14-3-3s (χ, κ, ψ) were identiﬁed as being phosphory-
lated by SnRK2.8 in roots at S93/95 (Shin et al., 2007). This serine
residue is conserved across only ﬁve of the Arabidopsis isoforms.
Tyrosine phosphorylation has also been reported in Maize and
Arabidopsis 14-3-3s (Olivari et al., 2000; Giacometti et al., 2004).
Few studies have examined the functional effects of these 14-3-3
modiﬁcations in plants.
Phosphorylation events that do have a biochemical impact on
14-3-3s have primarily been characterized in mammals. Some
of these phosphorylation sites have shown to be conserved in
plant 14-3-3s and may play a similar functional role (Aitken et al.,
1995; Dubois et al., 1997a,b; Furlanetto et al., 1997; Megidish et al.,
1998; Gringhuis et al., 2005). For instance, the phosphorylation of
human 14-3-3ζ at T233 has been shown to modify the ability of
14-3-3s to interact with clients by introducing a conformational
change of the C-terminus (Dubois et al.,1997b; Kubala et al.,2004;
Obsilova et al., 2004; Clokie et al., 2009). In plants there are three
sites within the C-terminal tail (helix 9) which are phosphorylated
during seed development in Brassica (Agrawal and Thelen, 2006)
and, as mentioned above, there is also evidence for phosphory-
lation at the C-terminus in Arabidopsis (Sugiyama et al., 2008;
Reiland et al., 2009). Based on the data from mammals, it can be
predicted that this may affect the conformation of the C-terminus
and client binding. Phosphorylation of human S58 affects client
binding, and compromises the ability to dimerize (Powell et al.,
2003; Woodcock et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2006; Jagemann et al., 2008;
Sluchanko et al., 2011; Woodcock et al., 2010). S58 corresponds to
residueS62inArabidopsis14-3-3ω. Thissiteisconservedacrossall
Arabidopsis isoforms with the exception of 14-3-3κ and 14-3-3λ.
In plants, phosphorylation atY179 and S185 affects client binding,
although the mechanism and their effects on 14-3-3 structure is
not known (Tsuruta et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2005; Sunayama et al.,
2005; Yoshida et al., 2005; Barry et al., 2009). Potential tyrosine
phosphorylation of the 14-3-3s at Y137 decreases binding to the
H+-ATPase (Olivari et al.,2000; Giacomettiet al.,2004). Although
the Y179 and Y137 sites are conserved across all isoforms, S185 is
not present in 14-3-3μ.
Since phosphorylation sites are not conserved across all
isoforms, differential phosphorylation could lead to increased
functional speciﬁcity within 14-3-3s (Moreira et al., 2008). This
leads to a situation where discussion of 14-3-3s must accommo-
date and acknowledge not only the primary sequence difference
among 14-3-3s but also the differential phosphorylation among
14-3-3s (see Figure 4).
14-3-3 DIMERIZATION
The 14-3-3 isoforms are present in cells as some combination
of homodimers or heterodimers. Dimer formation in 14-3-3s
involves interactions within residues of the ﬁrst four alpha helices
(Gardino et al., 2006). In any cell containing multiple isoforms,
if all isoforms could dimerize freely with each other, this would
allow for many different combinations. It has been argued that this
could dilute out any functional differences between or among iso-
forms (Wilker et al.,2005). However, there is evidence, particularly

is not always the case and that there are preferences for certain
dimer combinations. This potential is provided by the fact that
helices 1 through 4 do contain some of the areas of higher sequence
variation among isoforms.
It has been suggested that homodimers and heterodimers could
have different functions (Aitken, 2002). In mammalian systems,
studies have shown that two isoforms in particular, 14-3-3σ
and 14-3-3ε, show a preference to form either homodimers or
heterodimers. In one study, immunoprecipitation of endoge-
nous 14-3-3σ from a human cancer cell line showed that it was
present primarily as homodimers whereas 14-3-3β formed het-
erodimers to a much greater extent (Wilker et al., 2005). It is
thought that this preference of 14-3-3σ to homodimerize allows
it to bind isoform-speciﬁc clients and play a speciﬁc role in
the DNA damage checkpoint that is not shared with other iso-
forms (Wilker et al., 2005). Conversely, 14-3-3ε has been detected
only as heterodimers when expressed in vivo (Chaudhri et al.,
2003; Yang et al., 2006). Studies of the crystal structure of the
mammalian isoforms have helped to explain why this prefer-
ence for homodimers or heterodimers may exist. There are a
number of variable amino acids in the dimer interface between
isoforms. Subsequently, the number of stabilizing salt bridges
in the dimer interface varies between one and three depending
on the isoform. In the case of the 14-3-3σ homodimer, there
are three salt bridges and also extra interactions between aro-
matic ring side chains, stabilizing the homodimers (Benzinger
et al., 2005; Wilker et al., 2005; Gardino et al., 2006; Yang et al.,
2006). If 14-3-3ε was to form a homodimers, there would only
be one stabilizing salt bridge and therefore may be the reason
why ε prefers to form heterodimers (Gardino et al., 2006; Yang
et al., 2006). The two yeast 14-3-3s also show an inclination
to form heterodimers rather than homodimers (Chaudhri et al.,
2003). There is also evidence for preferences for particular het-
erodimer partners in mammals. Speciﬁcity was shown in the
dimer partners co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged 14-3-3ε
or 14-3-3γ expressed in neuronal cells which did not appear due
to the amount of total endogenous isoform present (Chaudhri
et al., 2003).
In plant systems, the issues surrounding dimerization are
even less resolved, particularly in vivo. Our early studies look-
ing at the in vitro dimerization potential of different recombinant
Arabidopsis 14-3-3s hinted that there may be some differences
between isoforms in their preferences for dimer partners. In that
study, although all four Arabidopsis isoforms tested were able to
form all combinations of both homodimers and heterodimers in
yeast-2-hybrid, there were interesting results when different iso-
form pairs were renatured in vitro and analyzed by native gels,
which suggested there are differences in the ratios of homod-
imers to heterodimers present between different isoform pairs
(Wu et al., 1997). In another Arabidopsis study, TAP tagged
14-3-3ω expressed in cell suspension cells was detected as both
homodimers as well as heterodimers with nine other isoforms
suggesting that in cells this isoform is able to form dimer partners
with multiple isoforms (Chang et al., 2009). In contrast, in a yeast
two-hybrid study with cotton 14-3-3s, none of the six isoforms
were able to form homodimers, yet heterodimers were detected.
Selectivity was also shown in the particular heterodimer partners
of the isoforms (Zhang et al., 2010).
Dimerization between different 14-3-3s is, therefore, likely
to be variable and depend at least on the intrinsic afﬁnities
among 14-3-3s isoforms. Further, dimerization is likely to be
variable within cell types, depending on the expression levels
and sub-cellular localization of different isoforms, in addition
to the phosphorylation status of isoforms. As mentioned above,
phosphorylation of 14-3-3s can inhibit dimerization (Woodcock
et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2006). There is evidence in mammals that
monomeric 14-3-3s may be functional too and may have dif-
ferent client binding properties to the dimers (Shen et al., 2003;
Zhou et al., 2003; Han et al., 2010). This leads to the conclusion
that dimerization status, particularly the degree of heterodimer-
ization, must be accounted for in any model of 14-3-3 isoform
speciﬁcity.
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE
Given the clear presence of diversity in the primary structure of
14-3-3s in plants, and further given that this primary sequence
diversitycanbeampliﬁedbyphosphorylationandbyheterodimer-
ization, what are the biochemical, cellular, and physiological
impacts of that diversity? Is the diversity an evolutionary collec-
tion of biochemically irrelevant genetic drift or is the diversity a
reﬂection of true functional speciﬁcation within the 14-3-3 fam-
ily? With multiple isoforms present in any cell, the potential for
dilution through dimerization, and with the common theme of
interaction with certain phosphorylated peptides, it is difﬁcult to
construct obvious modes of isoform functional speciﬁcity.
Our theory, however, is that true cellular and biochemical func-
tional speciﬁcity does indeed exist among members of the 14-3-3
family. Disproving speciﬁcity as a hypothesis would be difﬁcult, as
lackof datacannotconstituteproof of thehypothesisasbeingfalse.
Therefore, our formally stated null hypothesis would be that no
functional speciﬁcity exists among 14-3-3s. Rejection of this null
hypothesis would be accomplished by any clear observations of
speciﬁc function between or among 14-3-3 isoforms, which would
then support our broader theory of speciﬁcity among 14-3-3s. In
general, we posit that certain 14-3-3s in a given cellular context –
and only those 14-3-3s – will have speciﬁc interactions that are not
shared with other 14-3-3s, and as a result, certain 14-3-3s will have
functional phenotypes revealed by mutation. Data are emerging
from the literature in support of this notion. As a particular out-
come for developing tests of the hypothesis, we posit that multiple
14-3-3s may be present in equal concentrations within a cell, yet
each may biochemically interact with different clients and each
may therefore have different cellular functions and localizations.
Data from the literature and some primary data are presented
in support of this notion. Full consideration of all factors sug-
gests that it is possible that restricted groups of isoforms may
have interactions and functions that are shared within that group.
Members of a certain evolutionary branch would be one example
of a group with potential shared speciﬁcities. 14-3-3s phospho-
rylated at a certain residue might also constitute a functionally
speciﬁc group. And it is also possible that some biochemical
and cellular functions could be shared by all isoforms. But the
main idea of the theory is that out of the family of conserved,

14-3-3 Isoform functional speciﬁcity
dimerizing 14-3-3s within a plant cell, certain isoforms or iso-
form groups do have certain speciﬁc biochemical interactions and
functions.
ELEMENTS OF THE ISSUE
In order to address the theory and set up observational tests of
the null hypothesis, we present data of functional redundancy that
would fail to reject the null hypothesis, and also present obser-
vations of speciﬁcity that appear to reject the null hypothesis,
thereby supporting the theory of speciﬁcity. Note that the theory
of speciﬁcity does not explicitly deal with cell-speciﬁc expres-
sion of 14-3-3s, though this is an important overall component
of 14-3-3 roles. It is certainly possible that developmental speci-
ﬁcity of expression could present certain 14-3-3s with prominent
roles in certain tissues, regardless of the speciﬁcity at the cellular
or biochemical level. We therefore discuss brieﬂy just how much
tissue-speciﬁc expression of 14-3-3s might exist, then we examine
redundancy and speciﬁcity at the cellular and biochemical lev-
els as these levels do address directly the questions of functional
speciﬁcity among protein isoforms.
EXPRESSION SPECIFICITY
In mammals, early 14-3-3 literature reported differences in the dis-
tribution of isoform transcripts in different regions of the brain
by in situ hybridization, and also in other mammalian tissues
by northern blot analysis (Watanabe et al., 1993, 1994). The dif-
ference in expression between brain structures is also supported
by data from microarray studies in mice which show14-3-3γ to
have by far the highest expression of any isoform in hippocampus.
Conversely, the hypothalamus shows very low 14-3-3γ expression
compared to the other isoforms, with 14-3-3β showing the highest
expression levels followed by 14-3-3θ/τ (Rangel et al., 2009; Kim,
2012; Nijnik et al., 2012; Wefers et al., 2012). 14-3-3σ in particu-
lar shows notable differences in tissue expression compared to the
other isoforms as it has only been detected in epithelial cells (Lef-
fers et al., 1993). 14-3-3σ has received signiﬁcant attention due to
its proposed role as a tumor suppressor and thought to be linked
to the exit of cells from the stem cell compartment of epithe-
lia to become differentiated (Hermeking, 2003). As described
in the dimerization section above, this specialized role may be
due to its unique structural characteristics, not shared with other
isoforms.
In plants, early reports showed that Arabidopsis 14-3-3χ is
differentially expressed in tissues by analysis of promoter activity
and in situ hybridization (Daugherty et al., 1996). 14-3-3ω shows
relatively high expression in ﬂowers compared to leaves and stems
by semi quantitative RT-PCR analysis, in contrast to 14-3-3κ and
14-3-3λ which show fairly even expression across these tissues
(Sorrell et al., 2003). One isoform in particular, 14-3-3ι, shows a
distribution more restricted to ﬂowers hinting that it may play a
specialized role here (Rosenquist et al., 2001). This is supported
by microarray data from a number of studies which shows the
13 isoforms show a fairly similar expression pattern across tissues
(Dinneny et al., 2008; Grifﬁths et al., 2011), with the exception
of 14-3-3ι where transcripts are almost completely restricted to
closed ﬂower buds (Hennig et al., 2004; Figure 5). It should be
noted that in situ hybridization and promoter fusion studies give
an impression of greater cell speciﬁcity than observed by large scale
microarray studies of tissues or organs.
Rice 14-3-3 isoforms shows differences in expression across tis-
sues and this pattern is different between isoforms (Chen et al.,
2006; Yao et al., 2007; Purwestri et al., 2009). Interestingly, in one
study the Os14-3-3-C isoform, which showed the most evenly
high expression across all tissues studied, was also the most suc-
cessful isoform in complementing deletion mutants of the 14-3-3
homologues in yeast (see below). This led the authors to spec-
ulate that isoforms such as Os14-3-3-C, which show ubiquitous
expression across all tissues, may play very general and fundamen-
tal roles in rice. On the other hand, isoforms like Os14-3-3-G,
which are unable to rescue the yeast 14-3-3 knockout, and which
shows a more restricted tissue distribution, may play unique roles
in response to speciﬁc conditions or developmental stages (Yao
et al., 2007). A similar variation in tissue distribution between
isoforms exists in cotton (Shi et al., 2007), soybean (Zhang et al.,
2010; Li and Dhaubhadel,2011), and broad bean (Emi et al.,2001).
Vf14-3-3a shows higher expression in guard cells compared to
the three other isoforms. It was proposed therefore that Vf14-
3-3a may have a higher afﬁnity for binding to the H+-ATPase
than Vf14-3-3b, another isoform that is expressed in guard cells
(Emi et al., 2001).
EVIDENCE FOR REDUNDANCY
Redundancy in 14-3-3 function can be examined from several per-
spectives. One perspective is physiological and can be approached
by experiments with genetic mutations or TDNA knockouts
in plants. The other perspective is biochemical, which can be
examined by assays of direct biochemical interaction in vitro.
Physiological redundancy
One key observation in support of redundancy would be the
lack of observable phenotype in a 14-3-3 TDNA knockout. In
Arabidopsis, early studies indicated that several different 14-3-
3 TDNA insertion mutants had no observable phenotype at all.
Further, several combinations of 14-3-3 TDNA insertions appar-
ently had no observable phenotype (Krysan et al., 1996, 1999),
allowing for the continued debate over the extent of 14-3-3 func-
tional redundancy in plants (Comparot et al., 2003; Ferl, 2004;
Chevalier et al., 2009).
There are also examples of different isoforms being involved
with the same physiological response. Several 14-3-3s are involved
in drought-related processes, and speciﬁc 14-3-3 isoforms have
been implicated at the protein level in drought-stress, where over-
expression of different single isoforms, At14-3-3λ or ZmGF14-6,
can enhance drought tolerance (Yan et al., 2004; Campo et al.,
2012). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a knockout of one
of the two 14-3-3 forms results in a viable line, while the
double knockout is lethal, suggesting the two isoforms found
in yeast are functionally redundant (Lottersberger et al., 2006,
2007; Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008). This simple observation
strongly suggests that the yeast 14-3-3s are essentially redundant,
even though the single mutants do exhibit some growth differ-
entials. The yeast double 14-3-3 mutant can be rescued by four
Arabidopsis isoforms (van Heusden et al.,1996; Sorrell et al.,2003)
and a human isoform (Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008). This is a

profound observation that suggests strongly that most, if not all,
of the 14-3-3 interactions that are required in yeast are retained in
the isoforms of Arabidopsis and humans. However, recent results
suggest that this conclusion is not universal. The Os14-3-3-C iso-
form is much more successful in complementing yeast deletion
mutant than Os14-3-3-G (Yao et al., 2007). While there may be
basic or fundamental activities in yeast that can be supported by
many isoforms from plants, it may not be universally true that all
plant isoforms can complement yeast.
Biochemical redundancy
At the biochemical level there is evidence that 14-3-3 isoforms
have overlapping client binding proﬁles. Multiple mammalian iso-
forms show a very similar sequence binding preference based on
screens across peptide libraries (Yaffe et al., 1997; Muslin et al.,
1996). Six mammalian isoforms can all bind Bad in vitro and are
able to reduce the apoptotic effects of Bad on cells (Subrama-
nian et al., 2001). In plants studies, three different Arabidopsis
isoforms were able to activate the H-ATPase (Baunsgaard et al.,

14-3-3 Isoform functional speciﬁcity
1998) and surface plasmon resonance has shown that three barley
isoforms can bind a lipoxygenase enzyme with similar afﬁnities
(Holtman et al., 2000). While not exhaustive in their treatments
across isoforms, these studies and other studies indicate that at the
biochemical interaction level, there can be overlap and similarity
among isoforms with regard to client afﬁnities.
EVIDENCE FOR FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICITY AMONG ISOFORMS
Although data supporting 14-3-3 functional speciﬁcity in plants
are few, any observed speciﬁcity for any 14-3-3 function would
reject the formal null hypothesis of complete isoform redundancy.
From the literature there are now several cases of individual 14-
3-3 TDNA insertions conditioning an observable phenotype. The
fact that any phenotype can be assigned to 14-3-3s argues for
speciﬁcity from ﬁrst principles. Given the wide distribution of
14-3-3 isoform expression (Figure 5) it is likely that most cells
have 14-3-3s present in addition to the one that is knocked out,
hence phenotypes for individual 14-3-3s argues for speciﬁcity at
the cellular level. Moreover, there are also now a few comparative
studies in which phenotypes are known to be conditioned by one
14-3-3 isoform but not another.
Functional speciﬁcity revealed by TDNA mutations
Functional diversity of plant 14-3-3s is widely documented, and
includes primary metabolism, abiotic and biotic stress, light-
mediated processes, hormonal signaling, and basic cell growth and
division (reviewed in Aitken, 2002; Denison et al., 2011). How-
ever, discrete examples of isoform functional speciﬁcity revealed
by individual TDNA mutations are now emerging.
The Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms υ and μ are involved in light
sensing and signaling (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007). Mutant υ and μ
plantsﬂowerlaterandexhibitlonghypocotylsunderredlight,with
little effect under blue or far-red light. The long hypocotyl pheno-
type is consistent with a role for 14-3-3υ and μ in phytochrome B
signaling. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays
indicate that 14-3-3υ and μ proteins physically interact with
CONSTANS, a central regulator of the photoperiod pathway.
Together, these data indicate a potential role for these speciﬁc
14-3-3 isoforms in affecting photoperiodic ﬂowering via inter-
action with CONSTANS, possibly as integrators of light signals
sensed through the phytochrome system. These observations set
at least 14-3-3μ and 14-3-3υ apart as 14-3-3s individually capable
of regulating of ﬂowering time.
However, even though both 14-3-3μ and υ affect ﬂowering
time, they are not themselves redundant with each other. In the
ﬁrst place, redundancy between 14-3-3μ and υ would preclude
either one from having a ﬂowering phenotype as an individual
TDNA mutation. In addition, 14-3-3μ TDNA insertion mutants
have a distinctive short root phenotype, a phenotype that is not
present in 14-3-3υ TDNA insertions (Mayﬁeld et al., 2012). This
observation suggests that functional speciﬁcity is likely context
dependent.
In a demonstration of remarkable speciﬁcity that is likely
dependent on cellular context, the Arabidopsis κ and λ isoforms
differentially affect Phot2 signaling in guard cells. κ and λ are
closely related isoforms on a well-supported, separate evolution-
ary branch within the non-ε group. κ and λ differ by only a few
amino acids in primary sequence, yet λ is required for normal
stomatal opening by Phot2 while κ insertion mutations have no
effect (Tseng et al., 2012). This observation suggests that in certain
very specialized cell types, in this case the guard cells of the stom-
ata, very speciﬁc requirements for certain speciﬁc 14-3-3 do exist
(see also below).
Biochemical speciﬁcity
Plants have shown variation among isoforms in their afﬁnity for
speciﬁc client proteins. In Arabidopsis, recombinant constructs of
14-3-3 ω, χ, υ, ϕ, and ψ were comparatively tested for their ability
to interact with phosphorylated nitrate reductase from spinach
leaves, demonstrating drastically different levels of interaction
(Bachmann et al., 1996). Different levels of biochemical inhibition
of nitrate reductase have also been shown (Lambeck et al., 2010,
2012). Recombinant 14-3-3s have different afﬁnities for H-ATPase
(Rosenquist et al., 2000) and those afﬁnities are not in the same
relative order as described for nitrate reductase interactions. In
addition, yeast two-hybrid studies in barley show differences in
interaction levels for clients (Bornke, 2005; Schoonheim et al.,
2007) and barley isoforms differ in their ability to inhibit NR or
regulate K+ channels (Sinnige et al., 2005a,b). Six cotton 14-3-3s
showed speciﬁcity in target binding in yeast two-hybrid study
(Zhang et al., 2010). These studies do not necessarily stand in
contrast to those studies cited above in which biochemical redun-
dancy was demonstrated. Taken together, it is likely that there
is a range of biochemical interaction afﬁnities among isoforms,
with isoforms demonstrating similar afﬁnities for certain peptides
or protein clients while also demonstrating speciﬁc afﬁnities for
some peptides and protein clients.
Subcellular localization as a measure of speciﬁcity
Subcellular localization can be a powerful indicator of 14-3-3
speciﬁcity among isoforms. The localization of a given 14-3-3
could be viewed as being directed by two forces. One force is the
intrinsic localization of the individual 14-3-3 itself due to signals
present in the 14-3-3 sequence. 14-3-3s are known, for exam-
ple, to contain a Nuclear Export Signal (NES), and that signal is
thought to aid in the 14-3-3-mediated movement of transcription
factors out of the nucleus (Graves et al., 2001; Brunet et al., 2002;
Zhao et al., 2004; Nishino et al., 2008). The other force inﬂuenc-
ing 14-3-3 localization would be the location of the client protein.
Localization of the 14-3-3/client complex would be dependent
upon not only the localization signals of the 14-3-3 but also on
the localization signal of the client protein. If the 14-3-3 NES
was the dominant localization force, 14-3-3s would be expected
to be prominently cytosolic in their localization. To expand
this discussion we consider two possible 14-3-3 localization
notions.
At one level, consider the number of potential interactions
for a single given isoform. That isoform would have only one
set of intrinsic signals, an intrinsic localization based on its own
structure. The other forces determining localization of the 14-3-3
would be derived from its interacting client protein. Most esti-
mates of potential 14-3-3 interacting proteins in any cell, based
on the presence of the canonical 14-3-3 recognition sequences,
range from hundreds to thousands (Sehnke et al., 2002a). If these

Paul et al.
14-3-3 Isoform functional speciﬁcity
interacting proteins actually occur and are distributed randomly
among cell compartments (nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma mem-
brane, for example), the given 14-3-3 isoform should be broadly
dispersed among cellular locations because of the many locations
of its clients. Under such conditions of promiscuous client interac-
tion, a speciﬁc subcellular localization of any given 14-3-3 would
be very unlikely. However, there certainly are distinct 14-3-3 sub-
cellular localizations that are tissue-speciﬁc and different among
14-3-3 isoforms in plants (Sehnke et al., 2002a; Maraschin et al.,
2003; Paul et al., 2005; Campo et al., 2012). Further, disrupting
the client interactions can inﬂuence the localization of speciﬁc
14-3-3s (Paul et al., 2005; Sabina et al., 2007). Thus any observ-
able, limited, speciﬁc subcellular localization of a 14-3-3 supports
the notion that the 14-3-3 is interacting with a speciﬁc subset of
cellular proteins (see Figure 6).
At a second level, consider the potential interactions of two dif-
ferent 14-3-3 isoforms present in the same cell. If the two isoforms
were interacting with the same clients, the two isoforms would be
present in the same subcellular locales. However, isoform-speciﬁc
immunocytochemistry demonstrates that individual 14-3-3s can
and do partition themselves in different locations within the cell.
Figure 6 illustrates the localization of 14-3-3χ and 14-3-3ε in a
young Arabidopsis root. Both χ and ε are robustly expressed in
roots (see Figure 5). Yet the localization patterns for χ and ε are
distinctly different across the cells of the root tip (Figure 6A). In
the central cells marked with the C box in Figure 6, χ is largely
nuclear, while ε is largely associated with the plasma membrane
or cell wall. This single observation has dramatic implications
for the notion of isoform-speciﬁc functionality. Because χ and ε
are in two separate and distinct locations, they cannot be exten-
sively heterodimerizing with each other. If expressed equally and
randomly dimerizing, χ and ε would be present in a ratio of
1:2:1 of χ homodimers:χ/ε heterdomers:ε homodimers. There-
fore, two-third of the red and green signals would be combined
into a yellow heterodimer signal. This is clearly not the case. In
fact the majority of signal in these cells is distinctly green or red.
Because χ and ε are in separate subcellular locales, they cannot be
interacting with the same clients or subsets of clients unless the
intrinsic localization signals of the 14-3-3s are distinct and direct
the localization of the complex. Moreover, the fact of speciﬁc
and limited localization of these isoforms suggests that in these
cells, χ and ε are interacting with few, potentially unique, client
proteins.
In the root tip cells marked with the B box in Figure 6, χ and
ε are almost evenly distributed with regard to subcellular localiza-
tion. In these cells they could be heterodimerizing or they could
be interacting with a large number of different clients individu-
ally. Regardless, this distribution suggests that at least these two
isoforms have distinct roles in metabolic processes in the different
root zones, and further, that those roles can change depending on
speciﬁc cell function.
Other specialized cell types exhibit isoform-speciﬁc distribu-
tions as well. Subcellular localization of speciﬁc 14-3-3s was also
examined in plants transformed with GFP fusions of individual
14-3-3 isoforms. Subcellular differences among the GFP fusion
lines were most apparent in specialized cell types, such as tri-
chomes and guard cells (Paul et al.,2005). The guard cells provide a
particularly striking example. 14-3-3ε-GFP is distributed through-
out the cytoplasm, but diminished in the nucleus (Figure 6D).
On the other hand, 14-3-3κ-GFP is almost exclusively nuclear
(Figure 6E). 14-3-3λ-GFP is generally expressed at lower lev-
els, but when it is found in guard cells, it is always localized to
the edges that deﬁne the stomata (Figure 6F). This marked dif-
ference in the distribution of κ and λ was surprising given the
similarity of the two isoforms, however, distinct functional roles
for these two related isoforms has also been demonstrated with
respect to Phot2-mediated processes, where it was shown that λ
played a role in stomatal opening in response to blue light, but
κ did not (Tseng et al., 2012). The distribution of 14-3-3ϕ-GFP
is seen throughout the cell and nucleus, but is especially promi-
nent along the cytoskeleton (Figure 6G). In fact, live imaging
with confocal microscopy shows the GFP-tagged ϕ isoform mov-
ing rapidly along the ﬁbers of the matrix, to and from the nucleus
(Paul et al., 2005).
MODEL AND THEORY FOR SPECIFICITY
Data strongly support the theory of speciﬁcity in 14-3-3 functional
interactions at the cellular level. Two major types of observations
cleanly reject the null hypothesis that no speciﬁcity exists and that
all 14-3-3s are functionally redundant; the presence of phenotypes
for 14-3-3 insertion mutants and the differential subcellular local-
ization of isoforms within a cell. Given the wide expression proﬁles
of most plant 14-3-3 genes, it is likely that almost every cell in the
plant has a fairly complex population of different 14-3-3 isoforms
and that many cells contain many 14-3-3 isoforms. Therefore,
the existence of phenotype(s) associated with individual 14-3-3
insertion mutations is strong evidence that the particular isoform
plays an important role that is not entirely complemented by other
14-3-3s present in a cell. Earlier, general studies showing that
some 14-3-3 insertion mutations displayed no phenotype are now
being supplanted by speciﬁc studies of well characterized insertion
mutations that do display phenotypes. Furthermore, cell biology
observations deﬁne another element of speciﬁcity. Within a par-
ticular cell, different 14-3-3s can be found in distinct subcellular
locations, demonstrating clearly that the different 14-3-3s cannot
be interacting with all of the same clients and serving the same
cellular function. Among many, the example of 14-3-3λ and 14-
3-3κ is quite compelling and complete. These isoforms are closely
related yet show differential localization and differential physio-
logical function within the light signaling pathways of guard cells
(Paul et al., 2005; Tseng et al., 2012).
The statement that there can be speciﬁcity in 14-3-3 func-
tion within a cell is, however, a simpliﬁcation of a larger and
more complex model for 14-3-3 interactions and functions. A
full model for 14-3-3s interactions must incorporate a quan-
titative appreciation for (1) the number of different 14-3-3s
present in the cell of interest, (2) the concentrations of each
isoform, (3) the heterodimerization afﬁnity among the isoforms
present, (4) the afﬁnities for each of the isoforms for each
client target protein in the cell, and (5) any modiﬁcations of
the 14-3-3s. Given these complexities, it is perhaps remarkable
that speciﬁcity does exist in 14-3-3 function. Redundancies in
function also exist. Therefore, a complete model of 14-3-3 roles
must also accommodate some pool of overlapping speciﬁcities

and perhaps some completely redundant functions among
isoforms.
The 14-3-3 family of isoforms, dimers, and modiﬁed forms
should be considered a complex and dynamic system, a system
that should be addressed and better understood with each exper-
iment. This will require comparative studies. Where possible,
observations about a given 14-3-3 isoform should be compared
and contrasted with other isoforms within the same experiment.
This is a key element often missing in current 14-3-3 literature.
With increasing TDNA mutations publically available, for exam-
ple, contrasts in experiments should accompany statements of
14-3-3 roles, including data where no phenotype is observed in

14-3-3 Isoform functional speciﬁcity
some mutation(s). Care should be taken to be speciﬁc in the
description of isoforms in an experiment and conclusions drawn
from one isoform should not be considered to be true for other
isoforms until tested. The limits of reagents and databases should
be taken into consideration. For example, the Affymetrix array
does not list a probeset for 14-3-3ϕ, and the probeset for 14-3-
3χ very likely hybridizes with both 14-3-3ϕ and χ, presenting a
likely over estimate of 14-3-3χ expression. Similarly, proteomics
peptide databases do not always properly distinguish among iso-
forms, and peptides can be identiﬁed being from a particular
isoform when in fact that peptide can be from all members
of an evolutionary group. And TDNA insertions can result in
various levels of 14-3-3 expression at the protein level. Deeper
understanding of the 14-3-3 families and their roles as individual
isoforms will therefore require experiments that are comparative
among isoforms and a reﬁned approach that increases the ability to
identify individual isoforms and isoform groups as experimental
contrasts.
The theory of 14-3-3 speciﬁcity predicts that, when properly
monitored and experimentally contrasted, certain 14-3-3 isoforms
have a function that is not present in other isoforms – even if that
isoform is present in the same cell. This theory does not preclude
that there will be examples of overlapping function, but it does
state that some functions will be clearly distinct among isoforms.
Other systems of isoform families have embraced this notion. For
instance, mammalian Akt protein kinases are highly conserved
and function in the regulation of a diversity of cellular functions.
Yet phenotypic studies with knockout mice have demonstrated
that the three isoforms that comprise this family play distinct
roles in the regulation of cellular growth, glucose homeosta-
sis, and neuronal development. This reverse genetics approach
establishes that the functions of each Akt isoform do not wholly
overlap, and demonstrates that isoform-speciﬁc signaling con-
tributes to the diversity of Akt activities in mice (Gonzalez and
McGraw, 2009). In Drosophila, the demonstration that lines deﬁ-
cient in one or the other of their two 14-3-3 genes were not
fully functional lead to the discovery that D14-3-3ε plays a spe-
ciﬁc role in pole cell migration, a speciﬁc function that could
not be rescued by 14-3-3 Leo (Tsigkari et al., 2012). Thus it
is apparent that speciﬁcity in isoform families can be discov-
ered and appreciated within an enabled and aware experimental
context.
