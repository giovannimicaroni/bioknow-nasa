Abstract
Background
Nutritional
factors
are
associated
with
reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, yet mechanisms
remain unclear. We examined the effects of lycopene and
ﬁsh oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate
microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveil-
lance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that
lycopene or ﬁsh oil supplements would down-regulate
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cyclooxygenase 2
(COX-2) gene expression, respectively, reﬂecting putative
proliferation (IGF-1) and inﬂammatory (COX-2) pathways
relevant to carcinogenesis.
Methods
We conducted a 3-month randomized, double-
blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene
expression proﬁles (assessed by qRT–PCR) among men
with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day
lycopene, 3 g/day ﬁsh oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapen-
taenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acids) or placebo.
Results
Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to
ﬁsh, and 26 to placebo), there was no difference in the
change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF-1 expression
level between the placebo and lycopene arms (p = 0.93)
nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo and ﬁsh
arms (p = 0.99).
Conclusion
Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention
with lycopene or ﬁsh oil did not signiﬁcantly change IGF-1
and COX-2 gene expression in the normal prostate micro-
environment in men with low-burden prostate cancer.
Further analysis of global gene expression proﬁles may
shed light on the bioactivity and relevance of these nutri-
ents in prostate cancer.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in US men
(excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), with 192,000 new
cases and 27,000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2009
[1]. However, the natural history of this disease is
remarkably heterogeneous and not completely understood.
In the United States, 90% of prostate cancer cases are
diagnosed when they are of local/regional stage [1], and the
majority of cases are indicated for biopsy by an elevated
prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) level only [2]. Evidence

suggests that a fair proportion of early stage low-grade
tumors detected by PSA screening may be over-diagnosed
‘‘latent’’ cancers, and that patients could have equally good
survival without immediate treatment, and avoid or delay
morbidity associated with treatment [3].
Surgery or radiation remains the most common primary
management strategies for early stage prostate cancer;
however, both options are associated with decreases in
urinary and sexual function [4]. Active surveillance (AS)
(also called ‘‘delayed treatment’’) is becoming recognized
as an alternative for many patients with early stage low-
grade disease (‘‘low burden’’ disease). AS involves close
monitoring via PSA tests, digital rectal examinations, and
prostate biopsies, to delay or avoid deﬁnitive treatment and
the associated comorbidities. Standard clinical interven-
tions are offered at early signs of progression. Although
data remain limited and randomized clinical trials are
ongoing, some [3, 5] but not all [6] observational reports of
populations followed with AS or delayed treatment indi-
cate that men experienced comparable outcomes to those
with similar stage and grade disease who elected treatment
immediately, although further research with longer follow-up
is needed [7].
Our collaborative group established a program for men
with low-burden prostate cancer who opt for AS to be
offered participation in diet and lifestyle intervention
research [8–10]. Observational epidemiologic studies sug-
gest that dietary factors may impact prostate cancer pro-
gression. We previously reported that greater intakes of ﬁsh
and tomato sauce after diagnosis of prostate cancer were
associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer recur-
rence/progression among 1,202 prostate cancer survivors
[11]. Tomatoes are rich in the carotenoid lycopene, which
may have antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inﬂam-
matory actions [12] and inﬂuence the insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1) axis [13–17] that has been implicated in
prostate cancer [18]. Fish is rich in long-chain omega-3
fatty acids that may have anti-inﬂammatory protective
effects against prostate cancer, possibly through the inhi-
bition of COX-2 [11, 19–23]. We conducted a randomized
clinical trial to test the hypothesis that lycopene and ﬁsh oil
supplements would beneﬁcially affect gene expression in
putative cancer-related pathways (IGF-1, IGF-1R, and
COX-2) in normal prostate tissue of men on AS.
Methods
Study design
The Molecular Effects of Nutritional Supplements Trial
(MENS) was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-con-
trolled 3-month clinical trial of lycopene and ﬁsh oil with
each compared to a placebo. The three study arms were as
follows: two 15 mg lycopene soft gel capsules daily
(Lyc-O-Mato donated by, Lycored, Israel); three 1 g ﬁsh
oil capsules daily (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic
(EPA) and 549 mg docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acid;
manufactured by Perfect Source, Fullerton, CA with active
ingredient donated by Roche Vitamins, Parsippany, NJ);
or placebo (provided by the respective manufacturers of
the active pills for lycopene and ﬁsh oil). The lycopene
supplement was a whole-food supplement made from
tomatoes and standardized to deliver 30 mg of lycopene in
a soy oil base. The placebo for lycopene was isocaloric and
contained soy oil but no lycopene. The placebo for the ﬁsh
oil supplement was isocaloric and contained olive oil. Men
received lycopene ? placebo for ﬁsh oil (lycopene arm),
ﬁsh oil ? placebo for lycopene (ﬁsh oil arm), or placebo
for lycopene ? placebo for ﬁsh oil (placebo arm). All men
were also given a standard daily multivitamin (that did not
contain lycopene or ﬁsh oil; Dixon/Akyma) and instructed
to refrain from any other types of vitamin or nutritional
supplements during the intervention.
Baseline self-reported data on usual tomato and ﬁsh
intake were used to stratify patients to ensure a balanced
distribution of initial dietary levels among the three study
arms. Baseline intake of these foods was assessed using
questions and category deﬁnitions from a validated food
frequency questionnaire [24–27] that was also used in our
prior observational study [11]. The four strata were deﬁned
by the combinations of low or high tomato and low or high
ﬁsh intakes (i.e., [4 servings/week tomato products =
high; [2 servings/week ﬁsh = high [11]).
Study participants, eligibility criteria, and enrollment
This study was conducted among men with low-burden
prostate cancer, choosing AS for disease management, and
who met the following criteria: histologically documented
prostate adenocarcinoma, extended pattern biopsy within
2 years of enrollment with a Gleason sum six or lower with
no pattern four or ﬁve, no more than 33% of biopsy cores
positive for cancer, no more than 50% of the length of a
tumor core involved by carcinoma, three serum PSA levels
done at least 2 weeks apart over the year prior to ran-
domization and all PSA levels \10 ng/ml, life expectancy
[3 months, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)
performance score \2, and the ability to understand and
willingness to sign a consent document. The following
a priori exceptions were allowed: PSA\15 ng/ml for men
with concurrent benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis,
having a Gleason score of four reported only in a micro-
focus of tumor (deﬁned as \= 2 mm length) and having
[33% positive biopsy cores due to a tumor microfocus.
These criteria were consistent with the clinical standards of

our institution for determining the candidates for AS and
were approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). In
a single case, one participant had an initial eligibility
biopsy (14-cores) with 36% positive cores. With the
patient’s consent we requested permission from our IRB to
proceed with the ﬁrst baseline study biopsy for ﬁnal
determination of eligibility. This participant had no evi-
dence of cancer in his four-core research biopsy and was
allowed to continue on the study.
Exclusion criteria were as following: no prior or con-
current treatment for prostate cancer, patients with a PSA
doubling time\3 months (PSA doubling time = ln2/slope
of ln PSA over time, [28]), use of lycopene, ﬁsh oil or any
other dietary or nutritional supplement within 4 weeks of
study entry, use of Finasteride, Dutasteride, Saw Palmetto
or any other herbal/nutritional preparation indicated to
affect hormone levels within 4 weeks of study entry, use of
NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and/or aspirin for more than
7 days over the 1 month prior to study, history of allergic
reactions attributed to tomatoes, ﬁsh, soybean or olive oil,
gelatin capsules, or compounds of similar chemical or
biologic composition to lycopene (carotenoids) or ﬁsh oil,
and uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not
limited to, ongoing infection, congestive heart failure,
unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric
condition that would limit compliance with study require-
ments. Men who wanted to participate but who were on a
nutritional supplement or anti-inﬂammatory drug were
assessed by their doctors regarding whether abstaining
from the supplement or drug was deemed medically safe
and if so they were asked to undergo a 4-week washout
period before proceeding with the study. Compliance with
the study protocol was assessed via self-report and review
of the medical records and food diaries. Usage of any
dietary or nutritional supplement, ﬁnasteride, dutasteride,
or anti-inﬂammatory drug during the 3-month intervention
was considered a protocol violation, and men were with-
drawn from the study when such usage was discovered.
All potentially eligible men were identiﬁed at the Uro-
logic Oncology clinic at the Helen Diller Family Com-
prehensive Cancer Center by physician(s) and nurse
practitioners. This trial was advertised via ‘‘Dear Doctor’’
letters to urologist colleagues in the Northern California
region, local newspaper ads, brief radio announcements,
and ﬂiers handed out at local health-promotion, cancer- or
prostate cancer-related outreach events.
Clinical procedures and data collection
Before the intervention, men provided medical history and
underwent physical and digital rectal exams. The study
urologist (KS) performed an ultrasound-guided four-core
research biopsy to procure fresh tissue for RNA analysis.
After the intervention, the study urologist performed a
second research biopsy. All biopsies were reviewed by the
study pathologist (JS) to determine grade/extent of disease
and verify that patients still met the criteria for continuing
AS. After the intervention, men were followed according to
a standard AS protocol, including medical history, physical
exam, digital rectal exam, and PSA test at three, six, nine,
twelve, and 24 months. Participants also completed a val-
idated [24] semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire
at baseline and 12 months, and quality-of-life surveys at
baseline and 3 months. To encourage and assess compli-
ance, food diaries were also collected before each study
biopsy and once during the midpoint of the intervention.
Study outcome
The two primary outcomes were changes in normal tissue
gene expression between the baseline and 3-month biopsies
in IGF-1 and in COX-2. Change in gene expression for
each supplement arm was compared with change in the
placebo arm. Our primary hypotheses were that lycopene
supplement would decrease IGF-1 expression and that ﬁsh
oil supplementation would decrease COX-2 expression,
each compared to placebo. We also hypothesized (sec-
ondarily) that IGF-1R expression would be decreased by
lycopene versus placebo. In exploratory analyses, change
in PSA level after the intervention was also compared.
Biopsy processing
Core needle biopsies were collected at baseline and 3
months. Total RNA for RT–PCR and micro-array analyses
were extracted from areas of normal prostate peripheral-
zone tissue containing both stroma and epithelial cells.
qRT-PCR was conducted at the end of the trial to minimize
inter-assay variability.
qRT-PCR
Hundred nanogram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed
by using Quanta’s Qscript reverse transcription kit. PCR
was conducted in triplicate (5 ng cDNA per reaction) with
20 ml reaction volumes of 1X Taqman buffer (1X Applied
Biosystems PCR buffer, 20% glycerol, 2.5% gelatin, 60nM
Rox as a passive reference), 5.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM each
primer,
0.2 mM
each
deoxynucleotide
triphosphate
(dNTP), 200 nM probe, and 0.025 unit/ml AmpliTaq Gold
(Applied Biosystems) with 5 ng cDNA. The primers and
probes were mixed together and added to the master mix
and cDNA in the 384-well plate. PCR was conducted on
the ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) using the following
cycle parameters: 1 cycle of 95 for 10 min and 40 cycles
of 95 for 15 s, 60 for 1 min. Analysis was carried out

using the SDS software (version 2.3) supplied with the ABI
7900HT to determine the Ct values of each reaction.
Ct values determined for triplicate reactions involving a
test gene and a housekeeping gene (GUSB) were averaged
and subtracted to obtain the DDCt (DDCt = DCt 3mo—
DCt 0mo = (Ct test gene 3mo—Ct GUSB 3mo)-(Ct test
gene 0mo—Ct GUSB 0mo)).
Disease progression
Disease progression was deﬁned as a PSA doubling time of
\12 months [28], any adverse pathological ﬁndings on
biopsy (Gleason sum [6, any evidence of pattern 4 or 5,
involvement of[50% of any core, or[50% cores positive)
or other incidental evidence of clinical progression (i.e.,
positive bone scans or lymph node biopsies). Any patient
exhibiting progression during the 24-month study was
withdrawn and offered standard treatment. Patients could
also withdraw from the protocol at any time for any reason
and be treated off study.
Statistical considerations
Sample size
To evaluate the two primary study hypotheses, patients were
randomized with equal probability to one of the three study
arms: lycopene, ﬁsh oil, or control. The stratiﬁcation cohort
was determined using the patients’ self-reported intake of
tomato products (i.e., primary source of lycopene) and ﬁsh,
and patients were randomized within each of the four strata
(high or low level for each dietary factor). The study was
designed to test for a 2-fold decrease in expression of IGF-1
and COX-2 following the 3-month intervention compared
with placebo. Accrual of 29 patients to each of the three arms
was sufﬁcient to detect a 40% difference in the proportion of
patients with a 2-fold decrease in the expression of the IGF-1
gene with lycopene or in the COX-2 gene with ﬁsh oil, each
compared with placebo, using Fisher’s exact test. The power
of each test was 0.81 with a directional level of signiﬁcance
of 0.025 to adjust for the two comparisons. In addition to
comparing the proportion of patients displaying a decrease in
the delta cycle threshold (DCT) for the two genes of interest,
this sample size was sufﬁcient to detect an effect size of at
least 0.75 for the difference between arms in the DDCT
means using a t test with the same error assumptions. The
total planned accrual of 97 patients allowed for a 10% loss by
the 3 month biopsy.
Methods for analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared among the three
study arms using analysis of variance methods (ANOVA)
for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical
variables. To test the two primary hypotheses to detect a
decrease in the mean changes in IGF-1 (or COX-2) gene
expression between the lycopene (or ﬁsh oil) and placebo
arms a t statistic was used with signiﬁcance set at a prob-
ability\0.025 to adjust for the two comparisons. The same
method was used to test for a decrease in IGF-1R with the
lycopene supplement without any adjustment for multiple
testing. We used Fisher’s exact test to determine whether a
greater proportion of patients on the supplement arm
achieved at least a 2-fold decrease in IGF-1 (or COX-2)
expression when compared with the placebo group.
We
conducted
exploratory
analyses
using
2-way
ANOVA methods to investigate the change in gene
expression (pre to post-intervention) in DCT on the log2
scale due to the study arm (supplement or placebo), base-
line tomato/ﬁsh intake (high or low) or their interaction. If
statistical signiﬁcance was observed, the Newman-Keuls
post hoc test was used to identify which subsets were
signiﬁcantly different. Mean baseline and change from
baseline results were presented on the log2 scale.
Results
Between October 2003 and December 2007, 97 men were
enrolled (Fig. 1). A total of 13 men were excluded from the
primary analyses for the following reasons: never started
protocol intervention (n = 2), ineligible (n = 5), protocol
violation (taking nutritional supplements) (n = 1), opted
for active treatment after randomization (n = 1), experi-
enced disease progression prior to the 3-month follow-up
biopsy (n = 2), and experienced disease progression based
on the 3-month biopsy (n = 2) (Fig. 1). The remaining 84
participants comprised the current study sample. Three
unexpected adverse events were observed during the
intervention and classiﬁed as ‘‘possibly related’’ to study
treatment. These occurred among participants randomized
to lycopene and included indigestion (n = 2) and migraine
headache (n = 1).
Participants were not different with regard to baseline
demographic or clinical variables or intake of tomato or
ﬁsh across treatment arms (Table 1). The mean age and
body mass index at randomization was 61 years (standard
deviation 7.8 years) and 26.8 kg/m2 (standard deviation
4.6 kg/m2), respectively.
There was adequate RNA quality and quantity from the
normal prostate tissue to assess the expression via RT-PCR
for 74 patients at baseline and 79 patients at the 3-month
follow-up. Pre- and post-intervention RT-PCR analyses
were performed for 69 patients with approximately one-
third treated on each of the 3 study arms (22 lycopene;
144
Cancer Causes Control (2011) 22:141–150
123

21 ﬁsh; 26 placebo). These 69 men were similar to the 15 not
analyzed with regard to baseline clinical and demographic
characteristics (data not shown). We compared the baseline
DCTs for IGF-1, COX-2, and IGF-1R among the three
study arms and observed no signiﬁcant differences and no
pair-wise differences between the study arms (Table 2).
The mean DCT at baseline for COX-2 for all subsets was
noticeably higher compared with the other two genes. The
supplement and placebo arms did not differ for all three
genes when analyzed by the level of baseline tomato or ﬁsh
intakes. As might be expected, if gene expression reﬂected
nutritional intake, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the
DCTs between the high and low baseline tomato intake
(p = 0.02) and for ﬁsh intake (p = 0.02) but there was no
interaction between stratiﬁcation level and study arm.
After the 3-month interventions, there was no difference
in the change in IGF-1 (p = 0.93) or IGF-1R (p = 0.53)
expression between the placebo and lycopene supplement
arms. There was virtually no change in COX-2 expression
for the placebo and ﬁsh oil supplement groups comparing
the 3 month versus baseline levels (p = 0.99) (Table 3).
Only 27% of the lycopene arm achieved a 2-fold decrease
in IGF-1 compared with 23% for the placebo (p = 0.75).
Thirty percent of the ﬁsh oil arm experienced a 2-fold
decrease in COX-2 expression compared with 15% of the
placebo group but this was not statistically signiﬁcantly
different (p = 0.29). Similarly, no difference in the pro-
portion displaying a 2-fold decrease in IGF-1R expression
occurred for the lycopene and placebo arms (14 and 8%,
respectively; p = 0.65).
Exploratory subgroup analyses of the magnitude of
change in gene expression by study arm and by baseline
stratiﬁcation were performed. Overall, there was no dif-
ference in the change in IGF-1 levels with lycopene sup-
plement compared with the placebo (ANOVA p = 0.72)
but a signiﬁcantly greater change on average was observed
among those with an initial high tomato intake compared
with a low intake (132.6 vs. 67.7 (anti-log), respectively;
p = 0.01) (Fig. 2a). Even though a greater mean increase
was observed for those with high tomato intake initially,
there was no statistical difference between the low- and
high-intake subsets in mean IGF-1 levels for each study
arm (Newman-Keuls: Placebo p = 0.16; Lycopene p =
0.11). No differences between study arms or high/low
tomato strata were observed for IGF-1R (data not shown).
Similarly, no differences between the ﬁsh supplement and
placebo arms in mean change in COX-2 levels occurred
(ANOVA p = 0.78; Fig. 2b). This was also true when the
baseline ﬁsh intake was low or high (Newman-Keuls
p = 0.70 and p = 0.86, respectively) with a narrow range
for the change among the four subsets, 57.4–97.5 on
average. These results may reﬂect the possible limited
magnitude of change that could be observed with the study
ﬁsh oil supplement.
There was no difference in the change in PSA level after
the intervention, comparing the lycopene or ﬁsh oil arms

ml for placebo, 0.53 ng/ml for lycopene; 0.20 ng/ml for
ﬁsh; p value = 0.26 and 0.39, respectively).
Discussion
This novel randomized clinical trial demonstrated the
feasibility and safety of studying the effects of nutritional
supplements on the prostate microenvironment in men with
low-burden prostate cancer on AS. These results indicated
no decrease in the gene expression of IGF-I or IGF-1R
with 3-month lycopene supplement compared with placebo
and no evidence of a decrease in COX-2 gene expression
for ﬁsh oil supplement versus placebo.
Circulating lycopene, dietary lycopene, and tomato
intake have been inversely associated with the risk of
incident prostate cancer in most but not all observational

epidemiologic studies [12]. Studies of lycopene or tomato
intake in men with prostate cancer have also generally
supported possible beneﬁts. We previously reported that
men who increased their post-diagnostic consumption of
tomato sauce by two servings per week had an estimated
20% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer recurrence or
progression (p value = 0.04), independent of baseline
clinical features and primary treatment option [11]. Chen
et al. reported favorable reductions in leukocyte and
prostate tissue DNA oxidative damage and PSA levels
among 32 men with prostate cancer who received 1 tomato
sauce serving daily for 3 weeks [29]. Schroeder et al.
observed a favorable PSA response among 49 men with
prostate cancer and post-treatment rising PSA levels who
then received a combination dietary supplement that
included soy, isoﬂavones, lycopene, silymarin, and other
antioxidants [30]. This latter study, however, was unable to
distinguish if the effect was due to lycopene alone or other
components of the supplement. Preclinical and some [13–
17, 31] but not all [32–34] human studies have supported
the hypothesis that at least one mechanism by which
lycopene protects against prostate cancer is by affecting
IGF-1 levels or the IGF- axis.
Prior epidemiologic reports by us and others suggested a
possible beneﬁt of ﬁsh intake or marine omega-3 fatty
acids on prostate cancer incidence, recurrence, or mortality
[11, 35–37]; although several studies of ﬁsh intake have
also observed null associations with prostate cancer [36,
38–42]. Several in vivo and in vitro experimental studies
have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids, or a greater
omega-3:omega-6 fatty acid ratio, may have inhibitory
effects on prostate cancer cell growth or xenograft tumor
weight and in some of these models, this was accompanied
by an observed down-regulation of COX-2 [11, 19–23].

The hypothesis that ﬁsh oil or omega-3 fatty acids interact
with or affect inﬂammatory pathways has gained some
support from a few studies that observed a stronger effect
of these foods or nutrients on prostate cancer risk among
men with speciﬁc germ line variants in COX-2 [35, 37].
We observed no relationship between lycopene supple-
mentation and IGF-1 expression or ﬁsh oil supplement and
COX-2 expression in this study of men with low-risk
prostate cancer. Possible explanations for this apparent
discrepancy with other studies include differences in study
design, population, speciﬁc doses and formulations used
for the interventions, and different outcomes of interest.
For example, we used 30 mg lycopene supplement, which
may be less potent biologically than tomato sauce (used in
Chen et al. [29]). Lycopene is a fat-soluble carotenoid, and
studies demonstrate that its bioactivity may be enhanced by
simultaneous consumption of fat or by heat processing.
This study also focused on gene expression in normal
prostate tissue in men with low-burden disease. Chen et al.
focused on circulating and tissue DNA oxidative damage
and was conducted among men who were surgical candi-
dates who may have had slightly higher risk disease [29].
Additionally, our study focused on changes in the normal
prostate microenvironment; it is possible that these nutri-
ents may have greater effects on the tumor gene expression
that were not assessed (i.e., less than one-third of biopsy
samples had sufﬁcient tumor tissue available for analysis).
The 3-month intervention might also have been too short a
duration to observe biologic effects in the prostate,
although other studies with short nutritional interventions
in men with prostate cancer have detected gene expression
changes [29, 43, 44] including one conducted by our col-
laborative group in a similar population focused on a
comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention [9]. These
results do not rule out other potential important antitumor
effects (e.g., antioxidant effects) of lycopene or ﬁsh oil,
which are not modulated via IGF-1 or COX-2, respectively,
or potential post-transcription effects on the IGF-1 or
COX-2 pathways.
The placebo used for the ﬁsh oil supplement was iso-
caloric but contained olive oil, and this may have obscured
our ability to detect an effect of ﬁsh oil. It is worth noting,
though, that the placebo group experienced a slight down-
regulation of all the genes of interest similar to the sup-
plement arms, and there may be beneﬁcial effects of olive
oil versus ﬁsh oil on IGF-1- or COX-2-related pathways
that may warrant further investigation.
Limitations of this clinical trial include the short-dura-
tion of the intervention, examination of only single doses
of lycopene and ﬁsh oil supplement, inability to assess the
changes in the tumor tissue, inability to consider gene
expression differences by cell-type (e.g., stromal vs. epi-
thelial), usage of only a single housekeeping gene, and
relatively small sample sizes. Strengths include the novel
study design and focus on a timely important study popu-
lation. The population of men who might qualify for AS
regimens is growing, and it remains important to investi-
gate evidence-based lifestyle recommendations for these
patients.
In conclusion, 3-month intervention with lycopene or
ﬁsh oil supplement had no effect on normal prostate
expression of IGF-1 and COX-2 (respectively) among men
on AS for low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of
global gene expression proﬁles assessed using genome-
wide microarrays may shed further light on the bioactivity
of these nutrients in prostate cancer.
