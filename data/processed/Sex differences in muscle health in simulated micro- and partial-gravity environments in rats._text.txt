Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for astronauts. However, how male and female
muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of
this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones inﬂuence the progression of muscle
atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and
female Fisher rats (n ¼ 120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks re-
covery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight
bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were evaluated prior to and
after interventions. At 0g, females lost more dorsiﬂexion strength, plantar ﬂexion strength, and other metrics of
muscle size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not inﬂuence these differences. Additionally, at 0.4g,
females lost more dorsiﬂexion strength, plantar ﬂexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared
to males; castration/ovariectomy did not inﬂuence these differences. Females have greater musculoskeletal ab-
errations during exposure to both microgravity and partial-gravity environments; these differences are not
dependent on the presence of sex steroid hormones. Correspondingly, additional interventions may be necessary
to mitigate musculoskeletal loss in female astronauts to protect occupational and overall health.
1. Introduction
Skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety
for astronauts upon the International Space Station and future missions to
the Moon and Mars. Exposure to microgravity (or microgravity analogs)
is well known to elicit musculoskeletal alterations in humans and in ro-
dent models.1–3 To mitigate these losses, NASA has instigated strict re-
quirements for exercise interventions on the International Space Station
(ISS). However, these interventions are time-consuming (~2 h /day) and
do not fully mitigate musculoskeletal losses.4 Additionally, while certain
exercise modalities are available on the ISS, such as the advanced resis-
tive exercise device (ARED) and a specialized treadmill system, given the
space limitations for the upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and
future missions to Mars, exercise may not be a viable option for early
expeditions to such locations. Therefore, a more thorough understanding
of musculoskeletal physiology will be necessary to develop other in-
terventions to mitigate micro- and partial gravity-induced alterations to
muscle health.
One of the key areas of interest for astronaut health is to ensure a
thorough understanding of biological sex differences during exposure to
reduced gravity environments. While prior crewed missions may have
been disproportionally male, the current Artemis class of astronauts is
50% male and 50% female.5 Additionally, commercial spaceﬂight ap-
pears to be quickly becoming a reality, with future customers of this
enterprise likely comprising approximately 50% males and 50% females.
Therefore, understanding the inﬂuence of biological sex on muscle out-
comes is imperative to developing interventions for safe space travel.
Recent articles have detailed baseline differences in male and female
muscle ﬁber type distribution and metabolic activity.6 Disuse atrophy is
known to differentially inﬂuence different ﬁber types, providing physi-
ological plausibility for sex differences in the etiology of disuse atrophy.

One of the key experimental models for investigating spaceﬂight-induced
musculoskeletal deteriorations is hindlimb unloading, which entails ro-
dents being elevated from their cage ﬂoors by their tail or hip harness.
This position completely removes gravitational loading from the rodents’
back paws and elicits a ﬂuid shift towards the head, similar to spaceﬂight.
Extensive literature has been published using this model, which has been
elegantly described in previous reviews.7 Experimental research using
hindlimb unloading to investigate the inﬂuence of biological sex on the
progression of musculoskeletal deﬁcits after disuse have been conﬂicting.
One study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function
compared to males after 14 days of unloading.8 In contrast, others have
found female mice had exacerbated muscle loss compared to males
within seven days of unloading.9,10 These phenotypic differences were
accompanied by a relatively greater reactive oxygen species induction,
greater autophagy induction, and lower protein synthetic rates in females
compared to males.9,10 Moreover, an additional study found that female
mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially-targeted catalase as a
therapy to mitigate disuse, compared to males.11 However, it should be
noted that others have not found mitochondrially-targeted catalase to
mitigate disuse-associated atrophy in either males or females.12
One key difference between males and females is differences in major
circulating sex steroid hormones, with testosterone being a key sex ste-
roid hormone for males and estradiol being a key sex steroid hormone for
females. A comprehensive review of each of these hormones’ function in
relation to muscle health is beyond the scope of this paper and has been
detailed elsewhere6,13,14; however, it is clear that both hormones are
important for muscle size and strength. What is uncertain is if these
steroid hormones contribute to sex differences in musculoskeletal losses
during atrophy, or conversely if these hormones potentially mask
inherent musculoskeletal differences between males and females. Un-
derstanding the inﬂuence of sex steroid hormones on muscle loss is
important for understanding basic muscle physiology as well as possibly
developing interventions to mitigate muscle loss for astronauts.
The aggregate of the studies to date is far from a consensus on how or
if females may respond differently to a micro- or partial-gravity envi-
ronment. Moreover, considering the timeline of prior studies (0–14 days
of disuse), questions remain on whether sex differences exist, and if they
would persist with longer durations of unloading. Additionally, while
mechanistic studies investigating alterations in cellular signaling are
undoubtedly critical for an in-depth understanding of muscle biology,
they do not address whether the muscle will have different functional
capacity after exposure to micro- or partial-gravity. Alterations to muscle
function will be imperative for NASA to determine how to optimize
operational effectiveness and safety in the astronaut corps.
Overall, sex differences in the etiology of muscle loss have not been
fully resolved. Moreover, how sex steroid hormones may act to augment
or mitigate sex differences during disuse atrophy has not been thoroughly
investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how
biological sex and sex steroid hormones inﬂuence the progression of
muscle atrophy after long term exposure to simulated micro- and partial-
gravity environments in male and female rats.
2. Methods
2.1. Animal experiments
Overall design: All experimental procedures were approved by the
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC, protocol number: 081–2020). The overall protocol
(including pictorial description) for this study has been previously re-
ported.15 Brieﬂy, 120 male (M) and female (F) Fisher rats were obtained
from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, Stock number: 002).
At 12 weeks of age, the rats underwent either castration/ovariectomy
(CAST/OVX) or sham (SHAM) surgeries. Animals were given two weeks
to
recover;
thereafter,
they
were
divided
into
either
simulated
micro-gravity (0g), simulated partial-gravity (40% of bodyweight,
Martian gravity, 0.4g) or Earth gravity control (1g) conditions. Simulated
0g was induced with a pelvic harness around the animals’ hips to keep
hindlimbs
suspended
from
the
ground,
as
we
have
previously
described.16,17 Simulated 0.4g was induced with a harness and vest
system to allow the animal to keep all paws on the ground with reduced
loading, as we have previously described.16,17 Partial weight-bearing was
assessed weekly and adjusted as needed to maintain 40% weight bearing.
A total of 10 rats were used in each group. Animals remained in in-
terventions for 28 days. Immediately prior to and after interventions,
animals underwent a series of tests to evaluate changes in musculoskel-
etal strength (detailed below). After post-intervention testing, animals
were euthanized with 30%–70% carbon dioxide of chamber volume per
minute. Death was conﬁrmed with cardiac puncture. These procedures
are aligned with 2020 American Veterinary Medical Association Guide-
lines on Euthanasia guidelines. Hindlimb muscles were then collected
and weighed. Soleus muscles were ﬁxed in 10% formalin for 48 h and
rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for histological analysis.
Gonadectomy status and associated alterations are detailed in our pre-
vious manuscript using these animals.15
Animal housing: Conditions for housing has been published previ-
ously.15 Brieﬂy, all animals were singly housed in custom-made cages
speciﬁcally designed for micro-gravity or partial weight-bearing in-
terventions. Animals were kept in the BIDMC animal facility at ~22 C
with a 12:12 light cycle. Animals were allowed access to food and water
ad libitum throughout the study. Rats were fed standard laboratory chow
throughout the study. Food was weighed daily to ensure appropriate
consumption. Animals were also checked daily to ensure the harness was
functioning appropriately and weighed weekly to ensure they did not
have excessive bodyweight loss. If an animal exhibited extreme signs of
stress (> 20% bodyweight loss, anorexia, non-grooming behaviors, etc.),
it was removed from the study and euthanized. One rat (M-CAST-0.4g)
was removed from the study due to excessive bodyweight loss.
Grip Strength: Hindlimb grip strength was evaluated as we have pre-
viously described.15 Brieﬂy, animals’ hindlimbs were placed on a grip bar

attached to a force transducer (Ametek, Berwyn, PA). Animals were
gently pulled from the bar until they released their grip; the corre-
sponding force was recorded. Animals repeated this measurement two
more times; the greatest value was utilized for data analysis.
Maximally stimulated muscle strength: Maximal stimulation of dorsi-
ﬂexion and plantar ﬂexion muscles was completed as previously
described.15 Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane mixed with
oxygen using a vaporizing system. The animal's left foot was then taped
to a footplate (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System; Aurora Scientiﬁc,
Aurora, Ontario, Canada) and adjusted to ensure ~90% of dorsiﬂexion at
the ankle joint and alignment of the ankle and knee joints. The animal's
tibial nerve was stimulated to elicit either dorsiﬂexion or plantar ﬂexion.
To conﬁrm appropriate needle placement, a small (10 Hz) stimulation
was applied to the nerve. After appropriate needle placement was
conﬁrmed, a 200 Hz stimulation for 200 ms was applied to the nerve
generating a maximal tetanus. Maximal tetanic measurements were
visually inspected by a researcher to ensure maximal tetanus was
achieved.
Peripheral
quantitative
computed
tomography
(pQCT):
Peripheral
quantitative computed tomography (pQCT, Stratee, XCT Research SAþ,
Pforzheim, Germany) was utilized to quantify total muscle cross-
sectional area in the tibial compartment, as previously described.15
Anesthetized animals (~2% isoﬂurane) were positioned and images were
captured 40 mm from the tibial plateau with the following acquisition
parameters: voxel size: 0.10 mm, Ct speed: 10 mm/s. Images were
analyzed to decipher different tissue densities and corresponding area
with speciﬁed software provided by the manufacturer.
Histology: Histological preparation and analysis was completed as we
have previously described.8 After 48 h of ﬁxation in 10% formalin and
washing with PBS, soleus muscles were embedded in parafﬁn and stained
for myosin heavy chain type I (ab11083; Abcam, Cambridge, MA),
myosin heavy chain type II (ab91506; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and
wheat germ agglutinin to visualize muscle ﬁber borders (W6748; Ther-
moﬁsher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA). Images were collected with an epi-
ﬂuorescent microscope at 20  magniﬁcation (Zeiss Axio Imager M1)
and analyzed with Fiji (ImageJ, NIH) as we have previously described.8
All analyses were completed by a blinded investigator (DS).
Statistical Analysis: Longitudinal data were analyzed as percent dif-
ference between baseline and post-intervention values with a covariate of
baseline values. Cross-sectional data (e.g., muscle ﬁber areas and tissue
weights) were analyzed as percent difference from within sex and hor-
monal status (SHAM, CAST/OVX) 1g controls. A covariate of baseline
values was used for longitudinal data to account for the possible inﬂu-
ence of baseline values on the progression of muscle loss. Percent dif-
ferences were used to more directly compare data between males and
females despite their signiﬁcant differences in bodyweight and other
muscle parameters. The speciﬁc research question was to evaluate dif-
ferences between males and females at different simulated gravitational
loads (0g and 0.4g) and in response to different gonadal status (SHAM or
OVX/CAST). Therefore, we developed a novel statistical model in Sta-
tistical Analysis System (SAS) software using the least squared means
estimate (LSMESTIMATE) statement within the procedure mixed (PROC
MIXED) function. Primary comparisons of interest included:
 SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0g
 SHAM Males v. SHAM Females at 0.4g
 CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0g
 CAST Males v. OVX Females at 0.4g
These four primary comparisons were condensed into a priori con-
trasts and were tested globally with a joint F-test, as we have previously
described.15 If the joint F-test was signiﬁcant (p < 0.05), individual
contrasts were evaluated for differences between pre-planned compari-
sons. The p-values for speciﬁc contrasts were accommodated for multiple
comparisons with a Holm's adjustment (p < 0.05).
Additionally, within each sex and hormonal status, an one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factor of loading (1g, 0.4g, and
0g) was completed as a model validation. Signiﬁcance was denoted with
a global F-test of p < 0.05 and pair-wise comparisons were investigated
with a Tukey-adjusted p-value (p < 0.05). Graphical representation of
model validation analysis can be found in supplementary materials.18 All
data analysis was completed with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, United States). All SAS coding (including datasets), SAS out-
puts, and a pictorial description of the experimental design are available
in Supplementary Files.18
3. Results
3.1. Females lost more bodyweight compared to males, but had similar loss
in rear paw grip strength during 28-day interventions
F-SHAM-0g had similar bodyweight losses compared to M-SHAM-0g
(Fig. 1A). However, in rats post-gonadectomy, F-OVX-0g had greater
bodyweight loss compared to M-CAST-0g (þ14.9% v. 6.8% respec-
tively, Fig. 1B). After exposure to simulated partial gravity, females lost
more bodyweight compared to males, in both SHAM (9.4% v. 0.90%,
Fig. 1C) and OVX/CAST conditions (11.4% v. 3.9%, Fig. 1D).
SHAM females and males lost similar hindlimb grip strength after 28
days exposure to 0 g (Fig. 1E). In 0g OVX/CAST animals, females had less
loss in grip strength compared to males (45.3% v. 67.9% respectively,
Fig. 1F). At 0.4g, there were no differences in hindlimb grip strength
between females and males in SHAM (Fig. 1G) or OVX/CAST conditions
(Fig. 1H).
3.2. Females lost more muscle leg girth and corresponding muscle cross-
sectional area compared to males
In both intact and gonadectomized rats, and at both 0g and 0.4g,
females had greater loss in overall leg girth compared to males (SHAM at
0g: 9.2% v. 4.87% respectfully, Fig. 2A; OVX/CAST at 0g: 11.7% v.
0.91% Fig. 2B; SHAM at 0.4g: 9.1% v. 0.08% respectively, Fig. 2C; OVX/
CAST at 0.4g: 10.3% v. 1.1%, Fig. 2D).
With regards to total muscle cross-sectional area loss of the lower leg,
there were no differences between SHAM females and males at 0g
(Fig. 2E). In OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0g, females tended to have
greater muscle cross-sectional area loss, although not signiﬁcant
(19.3% v. 9.8% respectively, Fig. 2F). The same ﬁndings were
observed in the 0.4g SHAM group (17.9% v. 8.8%, Fig. 2G). However,
in OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0.4g, females had signiﬁcantly greater
muscle cross-sectional area loss compared to males (16.8% v. 3.8%
respectively, Fig. 2H).
3.3. Females had similar losses in muscle ﬁber cross-sectional areas as
males at 0g but greater muscle ﬁber area loss than males at 0.4g
In both SHAM and OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0 g, there were no
differences between females and males in relative difference in muscle
ﬁber area (Fig. 3A–B). However, at 0.4 g in SHAM and OVX/CAST ani-
mals, females had greater loss in total muscle ﬁber area than males
(34.8% v. 15.1% respectively, Fig. 3C). Moreover, this relationship
was sustained in OVX/CAST animals (29.8% v. 15.0% respectively,
Fig. 3D).
In myosin heavy chain type I-positive ﬁbers (hereafter referred to as
type I ﬁbers), there was no difference between SHAM females and males
after 0g intervention (Fig. 3E), nor within OVX/CAST rats (Fig. 3F). After
0.4g interventions, both SHAM and OVX females had greater type I ﬁber
area loss compared to males (34.7% v. 12.4% respectively, Fig. 3G
and 28.3% v. 13.9% respectively, Fig. 3H).
At 0g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats there were no relative
differences in the changes in myosin heavy chain type II positive (Type II)
ﬁbers between females and males (Fig. 3I–J). At 0.4g, SHAM females
were not different than males in the relative loss of Type II ﬁbers

(Fig. 3K), while OVX females tended to have greater relative differences
in type II ﬁber area, though this did not reach signiﬁcance (35.3% v.
17.1%, Fig. 3L).
In muscle ﬁbers expressing both type I and type II isoforms (hybrid
ﬁbers), there was no difference between sham females and males at 0 g
(Fig. 3M). However, in 0g CAST/OVX animals, females had a greater loss
in hybrid ﬁbers compared to males (46.7% v. 29.1% respectively,
Fig. 3N). After exposure to 0.4g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats, fe-
males had greater ﬁber area loss compared to males (34.9% v. 13.6%
respectively, Fig. 3O and 35.9% v. 13.2% respectively, Fig. 3P).
3.4. Females had greater reductions in dorsiﬂexion and plantar ﬂexion
parameters compared to males at both 0g and 0.4g
At 0g, SHAM females lost more dorsiﬂexion power (peak force
divided by time to reach peak force) compared to males (45.2% v.
þ27.8% respectively, Fig. 4A), while no differences were detected in
OVX/CAST groups at 0g (Fig. 4B). At 0.4g, there was no difference be-
tween SHAM females and males in dorsiﬂexion power loss (Fig. 4C).
Within OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0.4g, females tended to have
greater loss in dorsiﬂexion power, though this difference did not reach
signiﬁcance (36.1% v. þ7.8% respectively, Fig. 4D). We should note
that, although the males showed a slight increase in dorsiﬂexion pa-
rameters, the 1g controls animal had greater increases over time.18
Maximal plantar ﬂexion power was also evaluated. At 0g, females lost
more plantar ﬂexion power compared to males under both SHAM and
OVX/CAST conditions (31.1% v. 3.2% respectively, Fig. 4E and
15.9% v. 12.3% respectively, (Fig. 4F). Additionally, at 0.4g, females
also had greater loss in plantar ﬂexion power compared to males under
both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (6.5% v. 16.2%, Fig. 4G and
10.7% v. 10.0%, Fig. 4H).
3.5. Females tended to have greater loss in hindlimb muscle mass
compared to males
In SHAM 0g rats, females tended to have attenuated differences in
gastrocnemius mass compared to males, though this difference was not
signiﬁcant (26.4% v. 32.7%, Fig. 5A). Contrastingly, in OVX/CAST 0g
rats, females tended to have greater loss in gastrocnemius mass relative
to males; however, this difference was again not signiﬁcant (32.0% v.
25.3%, Fig. 5B). At 0.4g, females in both SHAM and OVX conditions
tended to have greater decreases in gastrocnemius mass compared to
males; however, neither of these differences reached signiﬁcance
(21.1% v. 16.2%, Fig. 5C and 24.3% v. 18.4%, Fig. 5D).
There were no differences between females and males in relative
soleus alterations at 0g in either SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions
(53.6% v. 50.1%, Fig. 5E and 53.5% v. 52.9%, Fig. 5F). However,
at 0.4g in both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions, females had greater

decreases in soleus mass compared to males (34.7% v. 18.6%, Fig. 5G
and 32.8% v. 22.8%, Fig. 5H).
Within the tibialis anterior (TA), there were no differences between
females and males (SHAM or OVX/CAST) at 0g (14.0% v. 20.4%,
Fig. 5I and 18.7% v. 18.6%, Fig. 5J). Similarly, at 0.4g there were no
differences between females and males in TA mass change, regardless of
hormonal status (SHAM, 21.3% v. 18.0%, Fig. 5K and OVX/CAST,
26.7% v. 23.7%, Fig. 5L).
At 0g, SHAM females had attenuated extensor digitorum longus (EDL)
loss compared to males (8.1% v. 15.7%, Fig. 5M). However, this
difference was not observed in OXV/CAST rats (Fig. 5N). After exposure
to 0.4g, there were no differences in EDL changes between the sexes,
regardless of SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions (Fig. 5O-P).
4. Discussion
There remains scientiﬁc controversy on how biological sex may in-
ﬂuence the trajectory of diseases. Our study builds on prior research in
this domain8–11 and concurs with prior literature ﬁnding females appear
more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males. These differences
are more pronounced during mechanical unloading and suggests females
may need more therapeutic interventions to attenuate musculoskeletal
losses upon exposure to different gravitational environments. Moreover,
these sex differences were present regardless of the presence or absence
of sex steroid hormones; this strongly implies that sex differences in
musculoskeletal pathologies are more complex than simple differences in
the sex steroid hormone milieu.
Our data demonstrate that females experience greater relative loss
across various components of muscle health in simulated micro- and
partial-gravity environments, including muscle size (Figs. 2, Fig 3, and
Fig 5) and muscle strength (Fig. 4), compared to males. These data agree
with prior studies in mice undergoing short-term exposure to disuse at-
rophy,9,10 but conﬂict with recent works in rats undergoing 14 days of
disuse.8 Although sparse, human data on disuse also appear to suggest
that females have slightly worse musculoskeletal outcomes with disuse
compared to males. For example, in a recent study of immobilization in
humans, females had lower force relative to muscle volume after arm
immobilization whereas males did not have these changes.19 Although
males tended to have greater loss in muscle area, females appeared to
have greater alterations to intrinsic muscle force.19 Additionally, in pa-
tients within the intensive care units, females have greater reductions in
handgrip strength compared to males.20 Other studies in humans have
found comparable rectus femoris area loss between males and females
after undergoing immobilization for a femoral fracture.21 In aggregate,
our data appear to generally be consistent with prior studies investigating
the inﬂuence of biological sex and musculoskeletal outcomes during
disuse, with females tending to have exacerbated musculoskeletal loss
during exposure to unloading compared to males.
It is noteworthy that we found OVX/CAST had little effect on overall
differences between males and females. If sex differences were purely
attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would
anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with

removal of such sex hormones. Yet, we ﬁnd that sex differences remain
and, if anything, are enhanced after gonadectomy. Our previous studies
using these same rats demonstrated that a lack of testosterone during
unloading had little effect on muscle losses during exposure to either 0g
or 0.4g.15 In contrast, although subtle, ovariectomy appeared to exac-
erbate musculoskeletal losses in females.15 Taken together with the
current analysis, it is conceivable that conditions, which result in changes
to ovarian derived hormones, may in fact exacerbate sex differences
between males and females. The relationship between changes in estrous
cycle and subsequent muscle size is supported by multiple prior studies
across multiple conditions associated with muscle loss.22–24 Regardless,
our ﬁnding that presence of gonadal derived hormones does not solely
mediate sex-based differences in the trajectory of musculoskeletal loss
suggests that other factors in addition to gonadal hormones contribute to
the observed sex differences. It is possible differences in chromosomal
make-up between females and males (i.e. XX vs XY), and subsequent gene
expression may be underlying these differences unloading-induced
muscle atrophy. However, that speciﬁc research question is beyond the
scope of the current investigation. Additionally, we must acknowledge
that due to the design of the study we cannot speciﬁc precisely which
hormones may be contributing directly or indirectly to these ﬁndings.
We must acknowledge that our results are in opposition of a prior
report by our group using the same hindlimb unloading technique in rats
to investigate the inﬂuence of biological sex and muscle loss during
disuse.8 It is not entirely clear what may account for the discrepancies
between these studies. It is possible that the duration of unloading

between our current investigation and the prior study (28 v. 14 days of
simulated 0g) could account for such differences; however, this expla-
nation seems unlikely as prior studies using shorter durations (1–7 days)
of disuse have found female mice tend to have worse skeletal muscle
outcomes relative to males.9,10 It is worth noting prior studies comparing
males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic
explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared
to males such as greater induction of atrophy-related genes10 as well as
greater relative induction of reactive oxygen species compared to males.9
We speculate that strain differences (Wistar v. Fischer) may play a role in
the differences noted between our study and the prior work. First, Wistar
rats are outbred strains of rats compared to Fischer rats, which are
inbred. Theoretically, inbred animals should have reduced genetic vari-
ability and hence less variability. However, recent works have demon-
strated inbred rats strains to overall have greater genetic variation than
would be expected in inbred rat strains.25 There has been extensive

debate on the scientiﬁc validity and utility of outbred vs. inbred
strains,26,27 which is beyond the direct scope of this investigation.
Regarding which strain is a more accurate representation of humans, it is
difﬁcult to directly speculate based on the current data. However, given
there is human data to complement the current study,19,20 it is at mini-
mum physiologically plausible the Fischer rat is an appropriate recapit-
ulation of human physiology for the current investigation.
Differences between males and females can be inherently difﬁcult to
analyze and interpret as males are typically larger than females; there-
fore, comparing means or raw change scores may hide potential sex
differences. Moreover, because males tend to be larger from the initiation
of the study, baseline measurements may interact with the overall tra-
jectory of muscle loss. It would not be feasible to match males and fe-
males on body weight or muscle strength at the initiation of the study as
that would result in either males being smaller than average for their age
or females being larger than average for their age. Therefore, for this
study we opted to utilize a relative change score (percent change) and
account for baseline differences with a covariate. We believe this analysis
strategy allows for more robust conclusions regarding the inﬂuence of sex
on the progression of muscle loss during exposure to micro- and partial
gravity environments. To facilitate this method of analysis for future
researchers, we have included our statistical code used for the study in
supplementary ﬁles.18
It is noteworthy that many of the sex differences we saw between
males and females were present to a greater extent at 0.4g compared to
0g. We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will
likely maximize musculoskeletal losses, regardless of sex. At 0g, it is
possible that males and females have both maximized the physiologically
possible muscle loss due to disuse, which may have concealed potential
sex differences. In contrast, exposure to 0.4g, which is a comparatively
milder stimulus, allowed for the presentation of subtle differences be-
tween males and females undergoing disuse. We assert that this partial
weight-bearing model may be an ideal model to study the subtle nuances
between males and females and susceptibility to disuse atrophy. Speciﬁc
to NASA, with the forthcoming Artemis missions and goal of building a
base on the Moon, sex differences are extremely relevant. Terrestrially,
rarely do muscle immobilizations involve a complete unloading of the
tissue; therefore, partial weight-bearing may be a more relevant model
for investigating musculoskeletal responses to disuse and how biological
sex may interact with these responses.
Applying our rodent model to humans, our data imply female astro-
nauts are likely to experience greater relative musculoskeletal loss and
likely prolonged recovery compared to male counterparts upon exposure
to micro- and partial-gravity environments. One well-known counter-
measure to mitigate micro-gravity induced musculoskeletal deterioration
is exercise, which is currently part of the standard of care for astronauts
on the ISS. Recent meta-analysis suggests comparable exercise adapta-
tions to males and females with resistance exercise.28 These ﬁndings in
combination with our results may suggest females require slightly more
resistance exercise to mitigate the effects of micro- or partial-gravity
environments. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tests
and warrants further study. Additionally, while this study did not spe-
ciﬁcally evaluate muscle recovery after exposure to reduced mechanical
loading, it is expected, given the greater reduction in muscle size and
strength, that females would have a more prolonged recovery relative to
males. Estradiol is known to be an important regulator of regenerative
capacity in females.29,30 The interaction between a low estrogen state
during micro- or partial-gravity and inherently greater muscle loss in
female astronauts may create a “double hit” effect on skeletal muscle,
whereby muscle regeneration and recovery are prolonged. Practically,
this could result in increased occupational risk for female astronauts after
long-duration space ﬂights; therefore, additional interventions may be
necessary to either mitigate muscle loss in female astronauts or facilitate
recovery upon return to Earth. Terrestrially, conditions that result in
muscle disuse and estradiol alterations may be particularly exacerbated
in females and may require longer recovery periods.
We must acknowledge a few limitations to the current investigation.
Gonadectomy removes many other hormones other than simply andro-
gens and estrogens. Therefore, it is possible lack of other hormones
produced be sex organs many have inﬂuenced our results in possibly
unpredictable ways. Additionally, our study used fairly young (14 weeks
of age) rats, corresponding approximately to young adult age. Consid-
ering the average age for astronauts is approximately 45 years of age,31 it
is possible using younger animals may not fully recapitulate a slightly
older human population. Finally, we were only able to model mechanical
unloading associated with spaceﬂight. Space travel is associated with
multiple environmental stressors such as space radiation, sleep distur-
bances and others. Therefore, it is conceivable these other variables may
interact with micro- or partial-gravity to alter our conclusions regarding
the inﬂuence of biological sex and muscle loss. Regardless, we believe
our current data provides valuable information on the ramiﬁcations of
micro- and partial-gravity environments to musculoskeletal function in
males and females.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated female rats have greater loss in
muscle size and strength compared to male rats after exposure to long-
duration partial or full unloading. These differences are conserved
regardless of the presence or absence of sex hormones. However, given
the discrepancy of the current investigation compared to prior works,8
more research is likely needed to fully evaluate the inﬂuence of biological
sex on disuse-induced muscle loss. If these results prove analogous for
humans, it is likely that females are at increased risk for adverse muscle
and related functional outcomes after exposure to reduced gravitation.
Given the potential future of spaceﬂight, both scientiﬁc and commercial,
more research is necessary to better understand risks and potential pre-
ventive therapies of muscle loss and approaches for accelerating recov-
ery. Importantly, since, based on this rat data, females have accelerated
muscle loss during exposure to micro- or partial-gravity environments,
interventions to mitigate these losses may need to be sex-speciﬁc in order
to ensure astronaut safety and future mission successes.
