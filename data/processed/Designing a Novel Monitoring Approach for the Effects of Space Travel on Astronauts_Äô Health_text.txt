Abstract: Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the
earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind ﬁnally began taking
signiﬁcant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and
building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous,
and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts
are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a
rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and
correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available
microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identiﬁed 218 differentially expressed genes between In-ﬂight
and Pre-ﬂight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations
across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically
developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel.
Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the
proposed assay.

1. Introduction
“Space: the ﬁnal frontier.” [1]. Every fan of the American science ﬁction TV series
Star Trek is likely to remember this cardinal line of the opening monologue. Indeed,
space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have continually fascinated humankind;
however, it was only in the last century that humankind ﬁnally took a solid step forward
by sending astronauts into space and landing on the moon [2,3]. In the 21st century,
humankind has made another great leap forward in space exploration: expediting the
International Space Station (ISS) program [4], sending unmanned rovers to seek signs of life
on Mars [5,6], and starting private space ventures [7,8]. In addition, NASA (The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration) is planning to send astronauts back to the moon in
2024 and to Mars in the 2030s [9]. Through all these endeavors, we have seen the twilight
of crewed space missions going beyond our harbor (Earth) and into deep space.
Space travel is challenging, dangerous, and full of uncertainty. Astronauts are under
sustained microgravity and cosmic radiation. Prolonged exposure to microgravity and
cosmic radiation has been shown to cause a series of health problems, including loss of
muscle mass [10,11], reduced bone density [12,13], compromised immune responses [14,15],
impaired renal functions [16], neurological system irresponsiveness [17,18], and develop-
ment of cardiovascular diseases [19,20]. Furthermore, microgravity and cosmic radiation
can cause several types of cancer, such as leukemia, likely due to compromised immu-
nity [21]. However, studies under simulated microgravity also show that microgravity
affects cell proliferation and apoptosis and can change cancer cells into less malignant

phenotypes [22–24]. These studies indicate that the impact of microgravity and cosmic ra-
diation on human health is profound, and it is unlikely that this impact is due to changes in
one gene or a small group of genes. Therefore, genomic, transcriptomic, and/or proteomic
studies are crucial to fully understand the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on
human health. These studies can lead to the development of effective strategies to monitor,
prevent, and/or alleviate the effects on human health caused by space travel.
Approximately 12 years ago, NASA and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency)
undertook a microarray study on 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) who had a six-month
mission at the ISS [25]. Terada et al. used qPCR to conﬁrm that space ﬂight changed gene
expression in astronauts [25]. Several genes, including FGF18, ANGPTL7, and COMP,
were upregulated and might play a role in inhibiting cell proliferation in hair follicles.
However, they neither discussed the potential effects of the differentially expressed genes
on the astronauts’ health nor provided any strategy to monitor these effects. Thus, in
the current study, we reanalyzed this microarray dataset, conceptualized a method that
could monitor the effects of space travel on astronauts’ health, and searched for potential
intervention options.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data Acquisition
Microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, which is the largest publicly available space gene
expression dataset, was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab Database (https://genelab-
data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab, accessed on 15 March 2021). It contains gene expression
proﬁles for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) that stayed in the ISS between July 2009
and February 2013. For each astronaut, 2 proﬁles were collected at each of the three time
points, Pre-ﬂight (prior to departing for the ISS), In-ﬂight (while staying at the ISS), and
Post-ﬂight (after return to the ground).
2.2. Data Processing
Individual gene expression proﬁles were combined into three DataFrames: Pre-ﬂight,
In-ﬂight, and Post-ﬂight using the Pandas package (version 1.3.0) in Python [26]. These
DataFrames were analyzed for possible outliers and veriﬁed for accuracy. Gene expression
readings with null values were removed. Then, Agilent IDs in the data were mapped to
gene names using the Ensembl BioMart database (https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/
martview, accessed on 15 March 2021).
2.3. DEG Identiﬁcation and Signaling Pathway Analysis
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs: |log2FC| ≥3.00 and p < 0.05) were identiﬁed
between the In-ﬂight and the Pre-ﬂight DataFrames using the DEGseq package (version
1.42.0) in R [27]. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) function was applied in the calculation.
No DEGs were identiﬁed between the Post-ﬂight and the In-ﬂight DataFrames. The DEGs
between In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight were then subjected to signaling pathway analysis using
the InnateDB tool [28].
2.4. Calculation of Gene Pair Correlation Matrices
Pairwise Pearson correlation coefﬁcient matrices for the 3 gene expression DataFrames
were calculated using formula r =
Σ (xi−x) (yi−y)
q
Σ (xi−x)2 Σ(yi−y)2 . The correlation matrices were subse-
quently transferred to be visualized using an R platform. To analyze gene pair correlations
for the signaling pathways, the expression proﬁles of the genes for the pathways were
extracted from the DataFrames to produce the DataFrame subsets. For each signaling
pathway, pairwise Pearson correlation coefﬁcients were calculated and visualized as out-
lined above between the In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight subsets and between the Post-ﬂight and
In-ﬂight subsets. Positive and negative correlations were represented in blue and red,
respectively. Additionally, gene pair correlation coefﬁcient differentials, ∆CC (In-Pre) =

Life 2023, 13, 576
3 of 15
CCIn-ﬂight – CCPre-ﬂight and ∆CC (Post-In) = CCPost-ﬂight – CCIn-ﬂight were calculated by
matrix subtraction between the In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight subsets and between the Post-ﬂight
and In-ﬂight subsets. These were subsequently visualized with correlation difference plots
with positive and negative ∆CCs shown in green and red, respectively.
2.5. Protein–Protein Interaction Network and Disease Network Constructions
The BioGrid database [29] and DisGeNET database [30] were downloaded in March
2021 to create a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and extract the disease interaction
information, respectively, for the DEGs. The networks were then constructed using Python
and visualized using Cytoscape [31].
2.6. Drug and miRNA Screenings
The Drugbank [32] and miRTARBase [33] databases were also downloaded in March
2021 to extract the drug and miRNA interaction information for the DEGs. The networks
were subsequently constructed using Python and visualized using Cytoscape. From these
two networks, we identiﬁed potential drugs and miRNAs targeting the 32 genes that were
identiﬁed to be used in a rapid RT2-PCR assay for space travel.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)
NASA and JAXA undertook Study GLDS-174: “Effects of a closed space environment
on gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station” between
2009 and 2013. Hair follicles were chosen for this study because they are the easiest
attainable and noninvasive samples that are understood to be representative of most
large-scale changes in the body [25]. However, Terada et al. only reported the expression
of selected genes in this study and did not undertake further analysis [25]. To better
understand how space travel affects astronauts’ health, we downloaded the microarray
dataset (E-GEOD-74708) from the NASA GeneLab open data repository. The microarray
dataset includes gene expression information for three stages: Pre-ﬂight (6 months to
2 weeks before launch), In-ﬂight (while staying in the ISS), and Post-ﬂight (2 days to
3 months after returning from the ISS). We then analyzed the dataset for gene expression
and gene pair correlation. Using cut-off criteria of |log2FC| ≥3.00 and p < 0.05, 218 DEGs
were identiﬁed between In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight (Supplementary File S1: DEG_list.xls).
The top 20 up- and downregulated genes are summarized in Table 1. However, no DEGs
were detected between Post-ﬂight and In-ﬂight, suggesting that the astronauts may need
a longer time than current guidelines for the body to adjust to the ground environment.
Furthermore, astronauts have a much higher risk of developing various types of diseases
than normal people and precautionary measures are critical to protect their health after
returning to ground.
As expected, the DEGs between In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight regulate a broad spectrum of
biological and physiological functions. For example, the most up-regulated gene LIMCH1,
encoding LIM and calponin-homology domains 1, activates the non-muscle myosin Iia com-
plex, stabilizes focal adhesion, and inhibits cell migration [34,35]. Thus, the upregulation
of LIMCH1 may explain observations that microgravity exposure can change cancer cells
into less malignant phenotypes [22–24]. The second most up-regulated gene IER3 encodes
Immediate Early Response 3 and regulates cell apoptosis [36], inﬂammation [37], and
tumorigenesis [38]. Upregulation of IER3 has been observed in several types of cancer and
may regulate cancer progression [39,40]. This implies another possible reason, other than
radiation exposure, that increases the risk of astronauts developing cancer during a pro-
longed period of space travel. The most down-regulated gene, NFATC1, encodes Nuclear
Factor of Activated T Cells 1 and plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation [41],
osteoclastogenesis [42], T-cell differentiation [43], lymphatic endothelial development [44],
cardiac valve morphogenesis [45], and tumorigenesis [46]. The downregulation of NFATC1
may result in osteoporosis, immunocompromised conditions, and prostate cancer in astro-

nauts during a prolonged space stay. The second most down-regulated gene, KIDINS220,
encoding Kinase D Interacting Substrate 220, modulates the development and function
of the nerve and cardiovascular systems [47,48]. The downregulation of KIDINS220 may
contribute to the development of neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases in
astronauts. In summary, the large variation of the biological processes regulated by the
DEGs provides a valuable resource of genes for us to develop a rapid assay kit (~20–
30 genes) to monitor astronauts’ health conditions in space. However, it is noteworthy
that the three genes reported by Terada et al., FGF18, ANGPTL7, and COMP, are not in the
aforementioned DEG list because they failed to meet the cut-off criteria.

3.2. Gene Pair Correlations
As mentioned above, the effect of space travel on an astronaut’s health is comprehen-
sive and involves the regulation of many genes. It is also well-known that any biological,
physiological, or pathophysiological change requires a delicate coordination of multiple
genes. Therefore, we decided to carry out a gene pair correlation analysis for the whole
genome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) among the Pre-ﬂight, In-ﬂight, and Post-ﬂight
expression proﬁles. As shown in Figure 1A, the genes are highly correlated in the Pre-ﬂight,
which is consistent with previous studies showing that gene expressions are correlated in
normal human tissues [49]. Upon staying in the ISS for an extended period of 6 months, the
genome signiﬁcantly lost its regulation of the gene expression and gene coordination was
scrambled (Figure 1B). Our previous studies have shown that loss of gene pair correlations
is a hallmark of carcinogenesis and/or cancer progression [50–52]. Therefore, loss of coordi-
nation of gene expression, other than cosmic radiation and compromised immune system,
is likely to be another factor that increases the risk of cancer development in astronauts.
Analysis of the Post-ﬂight dataset showed that returning to ground did not signiﬁcantly
improve genome regulation and coordination of gene expression (Figure 1C), implying
that the effect of space travel on human health is more profound and longer lasting than
currently thought. Extended care is necessary for astronauts to minimize the risk of disease
development. As we progress towards crewed missions into outer space (for example, to
the Moon and Mars) and other prolonged space stays, it is critical to develop rapid ap-

Life 2023, 13, 576

proaches to monitor genome regulation and establish corresponding protocols to alleviate
the effects of space travel on human health. Another important question that needs to be
addressed is whether the human body could establish a new “routine” for prolonged space
stays and what this would look like in terms of astronauts’ health. We speculate that loss
of gene expression coordination might also be responsible for other diseases/conditions
astronauts experience, such as muscle loss and compromised immune system. Extensive
further studies in space biomedicine and space pharmacology are warranted to prepare us
for longer-term outer space exploration.

10 astronauts during Pre-ﬂight (A), In-ﬂight (B), and Post-ﬂight (C). Positive and negative correlations
are represented in blue and red, respectively.
3.3. Signaling Pathway and Disease Network of the DEGs
Because DEGs are the most altered genes during a biological process, we conducted a
signaling pathway analysis of the 218 DEGs between In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight to ﬁgure out
which biological functions are regulated by these genes. The top 11 signaling pathways
were identiﬁed to be signal transduction, immune system, gene expression, metabolism,
metabolism of proteins, generic transcription pathway, developmental biology, metabolism
of lipids and lipoproteins, axon guidance, innate immune system, and disease (Table 2).
In total, 48 genes were found to be involved in the regulation of these top 11 signaling
pathways. Moreover, it is obvious that most of these DEGs are involved in the regulation
of multiple signaling pathways, and that these signaling pathways regulate a broad range
of biological, physiological, and/or pathophysiological processes. This analysis reconﬁrms
that space travel imposes comprehensive effects on the human system rather than affecting
an individual organ or tissue.

We further analyzed the disease network for the 218 DEGs between the In-ﬂight and
Pre-ﬂight expression proﬁles to identify the major disease/disorder conditions associated
with space travel (Supplementary File S2: Disease_DEG.xls). As shown in Table 3, the
top 20 disease/disorder conditions can broadly be divided into three categories: neopla-
sia/carcinoma, neurological disorder, and liver function, with the top three conditions
being malignant neoplasm of the breast, colorectal carcinoma, and malignant neoplasm
of the prostate. More DEGs were associated with tumor development than other dis-
eases/disorders. In 2019, Reynolds et al. reported the effect of space radiation on as-
tronauts’ death using a statistical analysis [53]. Of the astronauts who traveled to space
between 1960 and 2018, 53 NASA astronauts have died, with 16 of those deaths (30.2%)
being caused by cancer. Nevertheless, their study indicates that space radiation does not
strongly impact the mortality of astronauts. This implies that weakened genome regulation
(i.e., reduced gene expression correlation) is likely to be another key factor, in addition to
compromised immune function, in causing tumor development in astronauts. However,
these tumors may be less malignant or even benign [22–24]. Moreover, consistent with
previous studies [54,55], our results showed that space travel signiﬁcantly affects astronauts’
liver function and liver metabolism. Key genes identiﬁed from our analysis, such as GPT
and UBA5, might serve as valuable monitoring biomarkers of astronauts’ liver function
and even possible medical intervention points to protect astronauts’ health. Because liver
is a major organ for drug metabolism, a systematic space pharmacology study is needed to
establish drug proﬁles—including dosing, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion, and toxicity), and even formulation—in preparation for future voyages into
outer space. Space drug usage based on current information may be less effective or even
detrimental to astronauts’ health.

3.4. Design of a Rapid Assay for Space Travel
Any biological or physiological process requires a delicate regulation of genes, includ-
ing gene expression levels, interactions, and correlations. However, most genomics/genetic
studies are focused on gene expression level rather than gene pair correlation. Although
gene co-expressions and protein co-localizations are commonly studied in biomedical
research, our research laboratory, to the best of our knowledge, is the ﬁrst to apply gene
pair correlation coefﬁcient (a mathematical term) to describe and explain biological and
medical questions [50–52]. Thus, to design a rapid assay to monitor astronauts’ health,
we selected a set of genes with expression levels and gene pair correlations signiﬁcantly
altered by space travel.
We calculated gene pair correlation coefﬁcients (designated as CC) of the DEGs as-
sociated with the top 11 signaling pathways for the Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight
datasets, and analyzed the gene pair correlation coefficient differentials (designated as ∆CC)
between the In-flight and Pre-flight and between the Post-flight and In-flight (Figure 2). The
changes in gene pair CCs between the In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight datasets were obvious for
every signaling pathway, except the generic transcription pathway. However, the changes
between Post-ﬂight and In-ﬂight CCs were minimal. Thus, using |∆CC| > 0.70 as a cut-off,
we identiﬁed gene pairs with their correlation coefﬁcients signiﬁcantly altered between
the In-ﬂight and Pre-ﬂight datasets and summarized them in Table 4. These gene pairs
were then classiﬁed into four categories based on changes in correlation coefﬁcients: Cat-
egory 1—positive to more/less positive (highlighted in blue), Category 2—positive to
negative (highlighted in green), Category 3—negative to positive (highlighted in brown),
and Category 4—negative to more/less negative (highlighted in red). It is noteworthy
that Categories 2 and 3 contained more gene pairs than Categories 1 and 4, implying that
many genes lost their coordination and even started counteractive processes in space. This
observation supports previous studies that found that spaceﬂight signiﬁcantly affects gene
expression and homeostasis [56]. This dramatic change in gene expression coordination is
thought to affect normal biological and physiological functions in the human body and is
likely detrimental to astronauts’ health.
In a previous study, correlation was classiﬁed into three categories based on corre-
lation coefﬁcients: strong (0.68 ≤|CC| ≤1.00), moderate (0.36 ≤|CC| ≤0.67), and weak
(|CC| ≤0.35) [57]. To increase the sensitivity of the assay for space travel, it is rational to
only include gene pairs with correlations changing from strong to weak, weak to strong,
or strong to opposite strong with |∆CC| > 0.70. Using this guideline, we identiﬁed the
following gene pairs: 12 gene pairs from signal transduction, 11 gene pairs from immune
system, 2 gene pairs from gene expression, 5 gene pairs from metabolism, 6 gene pairs
from metabolism of proteins, 1 gene pair from developmental biology, 2 gene pairs from
metabolism of lipids and lipoprotein, 1 gene pair from axon guidance, 2 gene pairs from
innate immune system, and 1 gene pair from disease (Table 5). In total, 32 genes were
selected, and they are AARS2, ACSL4, ATF2, BIRC2, CCL2, CCNC, CHMP4C, COL4A4,
CREB1, CRHR1, CTNNBIP1, DPP4, EIF4E2, GNE, GPT, IL7, KIDINS220, MAGT1, NDUFA1,
NFATC1, PCSK1, PDPK1, PIKFYVE, PSAT1, RRN3, SOS2, SPON2, THBS3, UBR4, XAF1,
YES1, and ZNF606.
To get a global view of the 32 genes regulating biological functions, we constructed
the protein–protein interaction (PPI), disease-gene, drug-gene, and miRNA-gene networks
for the 218 DEGs and labelled the 32 genes in the networks (Supplementary Figure S1).
Genes that were present in the 32-gene list but not in the networks were not labelled.
Most of the 32 identiﬁed genes have high degrees of connectivity and are likely to be
biological hubs. Thus, we propose that an RT2-PCR assay of these 32 genes could be a
novel, effective, and comparatively cheap way to continuously monitor astronauts’ health
in space. Validation of this assay under microgravity simulation conditions is warranted
for further optimization of the gene list before sending an assay kit for practical tests in
space. Finally, we extracted the drug molecules (both approved and experimental, listed
in Supplementary File S3: Drug_list.xls) and miRNAs (listed in Supplementary File S4:

4. Conclusions
In this study, we analyzed the effects of space travel on gene expression and correlation
using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, and systematically devel-
oped a shortlist of genes for a novel rapid assay that could be used to monitor astronauts’
health in space. However, this study faces a few limitations. First, the sample size (10 astro-
nauts) is small due to the nature of space travel and unstandardized space biology research.
More sample collection is needed to optimize the monitoring assay. Secondly, there were
only two female astronauts in the microarray dataset. To get better representation and
higher accuracy in the analysis, more gene expression proﬁles from a diverse population of
astronauts should be obtained. Future studies in simulated microgravity conditions will
allow for the optimization and validation of the proposed assay. It is noteworthy that this
assay may address only one facet of a complete monitoring and treatment approach for
astronauts’ health in space. In practice, other factors such as biomarkers and physiological
metrics should also be included in the approach. Despite these drawbacks, our current
study proposes a new strategy to develop genome-based rapid assays. This strategy could
also be applied to other research ﬁelds such as cancer diagnostic assays.
