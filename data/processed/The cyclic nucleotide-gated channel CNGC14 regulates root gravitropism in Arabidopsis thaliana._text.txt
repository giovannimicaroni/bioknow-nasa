Abstract Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions 
in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. 
Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma 
membrane AHA H+-­ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response 
and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the 
role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we 
show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the 
Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily 
determined by the activity of AHA H+-­ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the 
root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin 
influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-­receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that 
the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.
Editor's evaluation
All the results present solid evidence supporting the impact statement that 'Plant roots can rapidly 
change the acidity of their cell walls and the root-­soil interface to efficiently navigate in the growing 
environment." These findings are important and have practical implications beyond Arabidopsis 
biology with potential future impacts in crop improvement, soil sciences and general plant physi-
ology. The evidence is convincing and appropriately validated in line with current state-­of-­the-­art.
Introduction
Plants colonize soil by the growth of their roots. Because plant cells are non-­motile, mechanically 
coupled by their cell walls and symplastically connected by plasmodesmata, the extent and direc-
tion of root growth is driven by the elongation of cells that can differ across the organ (Braidwood 
et al., 2014). The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the root apex is controlled 
by several phytohormone and peptide signaling pathways, among which auxin plays a specific role, 
thanks to its long-­distance intercellular transport that serves as the information carrier between distant 
plant tissues (Grieneisen et al., 2007; Wisniewska et al., 2006).

The root apex is divided in several zones fulfilling various roles in root development. At the tip of 
the root, the root cap covers and protects the meristem, and is the center of gravity perception. In the 
meristem, stem cells produce transit-­amplifying cells that populate the root tip (Dolan et al., 1993; 
Campilho et al., 2006). In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the root cap reaches up to the tran-
sition zone, where cells stop dividing and prepare for elongation; the transition zone is characterized 
by a distinct physiology and shows a high responsiveness to external factors (Verbelen et al., 2006). 
Further in the shootward direction, cells rapidly elongate in the elongation zone, propelling the root 
tip through the soil (Beemster and Baskin, 1998). After reaching their final length, cells differentiate 
in the maturation zone, where the root hairs emerge presumably to increase the absorptive root 
surface.
To elongate, cells must expand their cell walls, increase turgor pressure or both (Lintilhac, 2014). 
Proton extrusion into the apoplast by the plasma membrane (PM) H+ ATPases is crucial for both cell 
wall expansion and turgor maintenance. Acidic pH leads to activation of cell wall remodeling enzymes, 
and the H+ gradient at the PM drives the transport of most nutrients and ions, and as such is required 
for turgor pressure generation (Falhof et  al., 2016). It is therefore not surprising that root zones 
of numerous species show a distinct pattern of surface proton fluxes and cell wall pH (Siao et al., 
2020). In general, the tip of the root and the late elongation and maturation zones show outward H+ 
fluxes, while the transition zone and early elongation zones show inward H+ fluxes (Weisenseel and 
Meyer, 1997). Several studies showed that this battery-­like system, with positive charges flowing 
out of the maturation zone and entering at the transition zone, is mainly driven by H+ fluxes without 
completely excluding calcium and chloride ions (Weisenseel et al., 1979; Björkman and Leopold, 
1987; Behrens et al., 1982; Iwabuchi et al., 1989). Similar pattern of H+ fluxes was determined in A. 
thaliana, where the fluxes also correlated with root surface pH: an alkaline domain was observed at the 
border between meristematic and transition zones (Staal et al., 2011). Other works have attempted 
to determine the pH of the epidermal cell walls, and show a general decrease of pH toward the 
maturation zone of the root (Barbez et al., 2017; Moreau et al., 2022; Großeholz et al., 2022). It 
is important to keep in mind that changes in proton fluxes and membrane potential are not always 
correlated with change in pH. For example, a simultaneous leak of protons and uptake through H+/K+ 
symporter in the cytoplasm can lead to apoplast acidification with a relatively stable membrane poten-
tial (Stanković, 2006). In general, the relationship between H+ fluxes, cell wall pH, and the growth 
rate in the particular zones remains unclear: the highest pH is observed in the transition and early 
elongation zones, while the lowest pH and highest outward H+ fluxes are observed in the maturation 
zone where cells do not elongate. In particular, the mechanism of the alkaline domain formation and 
its physiological significance remain unclear.
The apoplastic pH is largely controlled by the activity of the proton pump H+ ATPases, encoded 
by 11 genes in the A. thaliana genome; in roots, the dominant paralogs are AHA1 and AHA2 (Haruta 
et al., 2010). While their activity is mainly regulated by phosphorylation (Falhof et al., 2016), the 
expression and membrane localization of AHAs along the longitudinal root axis seems to be important 
for the zonation of the A. thaliana root. Haruta et al., 2018, showed that under conditions of dim 
light, the AHA2-­mCitrine was less abundant in the membranes of transition zone cells, and this partially 
correlated with higher surface pH of the transition zone cells. Under conditions of light, the AHA2-­
mCitrine localizes to the membranes in the transition zone. Pacifici et al., 2018, presented a model 
where cytokinin signaling regulates root meristem size by controlling the expression of AHA1 and 
AHA2. Increased cytokinin signaling led to shortening of the meristem, similarly to an inducible relo-
calization of AHA2 fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. Finally, Großeholz et al., 2022, quantified 
the AHA2-­GFP signal and demonstrated an increasing AHA2-­GFP membrane abundance toward the 
maturation zone of A. thaliana root, which correlated with increased acidification of the root surface. 
Still, the observed patterns of proton fluxes along the root zones (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997), and 
in particular the existence of the alkaline domain around the transition zone of the root, cannot be 
simply explained by the expression or abundance of AHA proton pumps.
Roots use the gravity vector as the reference for the direction of their growth. A general pattern 
was shown in various plant species: during the gravitropic response, ion fluxes change rapidly, leading 
to increased proton secretion on the upper and decreased secretion on the lower side, where it 
correlates with growth inhibition, and results in bending of the root (Mulkey and Evans, 1981; 
Behrens et al., 1982; Iwabuchi et al., 1989; Collings et al., 1992; Weisenseel et al., 1992). In A.

thaliana, the root surface and cell wall alkalinization of lower side upon gravistimulation has also been 
clearly demonstrated (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017), and it was 
shown that this alkalinization requires functional auxin transport (Monshausen et al., 2011) and the 
CNGC14 calcium channel acting downstream of auxin signaling (Shih et al., 2015). Alkalinization of 
the lower root side is thus triggered by the redirection of auxin flux toward the lateral root cap and 
epidermal cells on the lower side of the root (Brunoud et al., 2012). Analogously, apoplast alkalin-
ization can be triggered by the application of auxin to the roots (Evans et al., 1980; Lüthen and 
Böttger, 1988; Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017). The root surface 
pH increases almost immediately upon auxin application, and this process requires the activity of the 
CNGC14 calcium channel; in the mutant, surface alkalinization as well as the auxin-­induced growth 
inhibition are delayed (Shih et al., 2015). The rapid root growth inhibition as well as the membrane 
depolarization and surface alkalinization triggered by auxin depend on the rapid branch of the TIR1/
AFB signaling branch; auxin influx by AUX1 and the AFB1 auxin co-­receptor paralogue play a promi-
nent role in the rapid auxin response (Fendrych et al., 2018; Dindas et al., 2018; Prigge et al., 2020; 
Serre et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Dubey et al., 2021). The molecular mechanism of surface alkalin-
ization is, however, not understood. It was proposed that auxin plays a dual role in regulation of root 
apoplastic pH: auxin alkalinizes the apoplast by the activity of an unknown ion channel downstream 
of the TIR1/AFB signaling, and, at the same time, auxin upregulates the activity of AHA H+ ATPases 
through TMK1 signaling (Li et al., 2021). It is not clear how auxin activates the TMK kinases. On the 
other hand, the connection between TIR1/AFB auxin signaling and activity of AHAs has been clari-
fied: the auxin-­induced SAUR proteins inhibit the PP2C-­D clade of protein phosphatases that act as 
negative regulators of AHAs, leading to the activation of proton secretion. This pathway was studied 
mainly in shoots, but seems also to operate in roots, as the Arabidopsis lines with manipulated SAUR 
or PP2C-­D expression show root phenotypes that are consistent with the expected changes in AHA 
activities (Spartz et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2018). In summary, the connection between auxin signaling, 
regulation of the activity of AHA H+ ATPases, and the longitudinal zonation of the root surface pH 
profile during normal growth and during gravitropic responses remains unclear.
Here, by employing an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, we 
focus on the molecular actors involved in the establishment of the longitudinal surface pH zonation. 
In particular, we show that the alkaline domain around the transition zone is not caused by the lack 
of AHA H+ ATPases activity. Further, we demonstrate that the alkaline domain at the transition zone 
is controlled by the components of the rapid auxin response pathway. Finally, we address the signifi-
cance of the dynamic surface pH profile for the gravitropic response of the roots.
Results
The Arabidopsis root shows distinct acidic and alkaline root surface pH 
domains
To monitor the spatio-­temporal dynamics of root ion fluxes and apoplastic pH in vertically growing 
roots of A. thaliana, we re-­evaluated the available fluorescence staining methods to visualize pH in 
roots. Cell wall staining by 8-­hydroxypyrene-­1,3,6-­trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) (Barbez et al., 
2017) was not satisfactory in our setup, due to the very high background signal and probably due to 
the absence of the optimal 458 nm excitation in our vertical stage spinning disk microscope (Serre 
et al., 2021). However, at the transition zone of the root, we could observe an alkaline domain on 
the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a). Further, we attempted to visualize root surface 
pH using Fluorescein Dextran and Oregon Green Dextran (Figure  1—figure supplement 1a) pH 
reporters (Monshausen et al., 2011; Geilfus and Mühling, 2011), but the results were not satisfac-
tory due to an artifact when roots were imaged on solid medium (Figure 1—figure supplement 1d). 
We therefore searched for alternative pH-­sensitive fluorescent dyes, and discovered Fluorescein-­5-­
(and-­6)-­Sulfonic Acid, Trisodium Salt (FS) (Invitrogen F1130; Seksek et al., 1995; Rosario and Rojas, 
1986) as an excellent reporter of root surface pH.
The F488/405 excitation ratio of FS efficiently reported pH when dissolved in liquid or solid medium 
(Figure 1a–d, Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,c). The F488/405 excitation ratio of FS is insensitive to 
the redox state of the medium but influenced by cation concentration (Figure 1—figure supplement 
1e). FS allows to visualize pH of the root surface and the surrounding rhizosphere, without penetrating

the root tissues (Figure 1e). The pH imaging with FS highlighted the previously described relatively 
alkaline domain in the transition zone/early elongation zone of the root (Monshausen et al., 2011; 
Staal et al., 2011). In addition, we observed two relatively acidic pH domains, one located in the late 
elongation/root hair zone and the other in the proximity of the root tip (Figure 1e). To unbiasedly 
quantify the root surface pH, we developed a Python-­based program to determine the F488/405 ratio 
of the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1f). The quantification highlighted the presence of 
the observed relatively alkaline and acidic domains (Figure 1f). Throughout the text, we will refer to 
these domains as alkaline and acidic domains, by which we mean values relatively acidic or relatively 
alkaline in comparison with the pH of the medium. The surface pH profile of roots shown by FS is 
in agreement with the data obtained using numerous electrode and microscopy measurements in 
several species including A. thaliana (Zieschang et al., 1993; Staal et al., 2011; Monshausen et al., 
1996; Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997). The FS pH detection range thus reveals both the alkaline and 
acidic domains of the root surface and allows direct and dynamic visualization of proton concentration 
on the root surface and its close surroundings.
The alkaline domain in the transition zone is not directly determined by 
AHA activation or localization
We first hypothesized that the observed spatial surface pH gradients might originate from gradi-
ents of AHA ATPase abundance or activity (Großeholz et al., 2022). We therefore immunolocalized 
endogenous AHAs using the antibody which recognizes multiple AHA ATPases paralogs in multiple 
plant species (Agrisera AS07260). To test the specificity of the antibody in Arabidopsis roots, we 
imaged Col-­0 roots, aha2-­4 mutants lacking the dominant AHA2 paralogue, and lines inducibly 
expressing a dominant version of AHA2 (AHA2-­d95-­mScarlet). The antibody showed signal in the 
PM in Col-­0 and aha2-­4 roots (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b). When we inducibly over-
expressed the AHA2-­d95-­mScarlet, we detected colocalization of the mScarlet signal with the anti-
body signal (Figure 2—figure supplement 1c). These results indicate that the antibody recognized 
multiple plasma membrane localized AHAs in Arabidopsis roots. The immunolocalization of endog-
enous AHAs, however, didn’t reveal any obvious absence of AHAs in the transition zone (Figure 2a, 
Figure 2—figure supplement 1d) that would explain the presence of the alkaline domain. To over-
come the hypothetical lack of AHA activation in the TZ, we treated seedlings with fusicoccin (FC), a 
fungal toxin that stimulates the AHA’s activity (Ballio et al., 1964) and thus increases proton efflux. FC 
lowered the surface pH of the root acidic domains but, surprisingly, did not affect the alkaline domain 
(Figure 2b and c). This partial acidification was correlated with the known FC-­induced stimulation of 
root growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a).
To exclude an FC-­independent regulation of AHAs in the TZ, we created A. thaliana lines inducibly 
expressing a fluorescently tagged hyperactive version of AHA2 (Pacheco-­Villalobos et al., 2016) - 
AHA2-­d95-­mScarlet, and lines expressing an inhibitor of AHAs PP2CD1-­mScarlet (Ren et al., 2018) 
under the control of the epidermal/cortex PIN2 promoter (Figure  2d). Expression of hyperactive 
AHA2 increased the acidic domain in the root tip, slightly reduced the alkaline domain, but did not 
prevent its formation (Figure 2e and f). This restricted acidification led to a tendency to stimulate root 
growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b).

Inhibition of AHA activity by overexpression of PP2C-­D1 raised the overall root tip surface pH, but 
did not prevent the formation of the alkaline domain in the TZ (Figure 2e and f). Alkalinization of the 
root tip surface correlated with a statistically insignificant reduction of root growth (Figure 2—figure 
supplement 2b). We further measured the root surface pH profile of aha2 and pp2c-­d triple mutants 
that showed decreased (Haruta and Sussman, 2012) and increased (Ren et al., 2018) AHA activity, 
respectively. Plants lacking the expression of PP2CDs showed a significantly acidified root tip surface, 
however, the alkaline halo remained unaffected (Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and h). On the 
other hand, plants lacking the expression of AHA2 were slightly impaired in the alkaline halo domain 
formation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and h). aha2-­4 roots were growing slower than Col-­0 
while pp2c-­d triple root growth was stimulated (Figure 2—figure supplement 2g).
The manipulation of the AHA proton pump activity resulted in the expected outcome of influencing 
the overall root surface pH and root growth. However, the spatial organization of the root surface pH 
profile with the alkaline domain of the TZ does not appear to be simply controlled by the activation or

abundance of AHAs, as the alkaline domain cannot be fully removed by genetic or pharmacological 
modulation of the proton pumping activity.
The establishment of the alkaline pH domain requires AUX1
It is well established that the application of auxin to roots causes an increase in apoplastic and root 
surface pH (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Li et al., 2021). To investigate the effect of 
auxin application on surface pH profile and formation of the TZ alkaline domain, we analyzed surface 
pH in response to the native auxin indole-­3-­acetic acid (IAA). With the increasing IAA concentration, 
the alkaline domain pH rose and the domain expanded toward the elongation zone of the root, which 
resulted in disappearance of the acidic domain (Figure 3a and b). The extent of the surface alkalini-
zation correlated with IAA-­induced root growth inhibition; the response was detectable at 1 nM IAA 
and was saturated between 100 and 1000 nM IAA (Figure 3c). This implies that the entire root surface 
is capable of alkalinization upon external auxin treatment, and that the alkaline domain is the hotspot 
of auxin response.
We further analyzed the root surface pH response to IAA in line with altered AHA activity. The 
PIN2>>AHA2-­d95 and PIN2>>PP2  CD1 (Figure  2—figure supplement 2c and d) as well as the 
pp2c-­d triple mutant responded to IAA treatment by alkalinization of the root surface pH (Figure 2—
figure supplement 2h and i). The alkalinization factors (a measure of IAA-­induced alkalinization) were 
similar to Col-­0 with the exception of the very root tip of pp2c-­d triple which responded slightly less 
(Figure 2—figure supplement 2e and j). These results were correlated with control level IAA-­induced 
root growth inhibition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b and g). On the other hand, knockout muta-
tion of AHA2 led to reduced IAA-­induced root surface alkalinization (Figure 2—figure supplement 
2h, i and j), but strong enough to observe an auxin-­induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2—figure 
supplement 2g). The alkaline domain does not seem to be caused by the lack of proton efflux in the 
TZ, and the amplitude of the alkaline domain can be increased by auxin application. We therefore 
tested how auxin transport, perception, and response contribute to the spatial determination of root 
surface pH. First, we tested the mutant in the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier, in which the shootward auxin 
flux through the outer root tissues is perturbed (Luschnig et al., 1998; Müller et al., 1998). The pin2 
mutant root showed a reduced alkaline domain that was shifted toward the root tip (Figure 3d and 
e). Upon application of 10 nM IAA to pin2 mutant, the alkaline domain position and amplitude were 
partially restored (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b), the pin2 roots also responded to auxin 
by growth inhibition (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c). Upon treatment with 100 nM IAA, the alka-
line domain and the overall IAA-­induced root alkalinization were fully restored (Figure 3d and f and 
Figure 3—figure supplement 1d and e).
The auxin influx carrier AUX1 is essential for auxin uptake and transport during root gravitropism 
(Swarup et al., 2005; Band et al., 2014), and the null aux1 mutant was shown to have a more acidic 
surface with an altered root tip pH profile (Monshausen et al., 2011). We determined the root surface 
pH profile in the aux1 mutant, and found that its pH showed a gradual decrease from the tip toward 
the root hair zone. While the acidic zone in the elongation zone was comparable to control roots, aux1 
mutants displayed a complete absence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 3d and e). Application of 
10 nM IAA on aux1 mutants did not affect root elongation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c) and did 
not trigger a root surface alkalinization in contrast to the control Col-­0 (Figure 3—figure supplement 
1a and b). However, at 100 nM IAA, when IAA diffusion compensates for AUX1 function (Evans et al., 
1994), aux1 mutant showed a clear IAA-­induced root growth inhibition (Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 1e) as well as an increased root surface pH beyond the TZ (Figure 3d and f and Figure 3—
figure supplement 1d). The wild-­type (WT)-­like root surface pH profile was, however, not restored by 
IAA application, demonstrating that AUX1 is essential for creating the alkaline surface domain in the 
transition zone.
As the immunolocalization pattern of AHAs in the aux1 mutant was comparable to the Col-­0 
control (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d), we treated the mutant with FC to investigate the activa-
tion status of AHAs in the aux1 mutant. Interestingly, this treatment resulted in the establishment of a 
small alkaline domain also in the aux1 mutant (Figure 3—figure supplement 1f and h), likely caused 
by AHA-­mediated acidification in the root tip and the distal elongation zone that did not affect the 
TZ surface pH. The partial acidification was again correlated with a significant root growth stimulation 
(Figure 3—figure supplement 1g). This experiment showed that AHAs are not fully activated in aux1

mutant and implies a specific surface pH response of the cells of the TZ. In summary, we have shown 
that the distinctive alkaline domain at the transition zone of the root depends on AUX1-­mediated 
auxin influx. Without auxin influx, the root shows a linear acidification gradient from the root tip to the 
maturation zone.
The components of the rapid auxin response pathway steer the 
transition zone root surface pH
Once in the cytoplasm, auxin triggers responses either through the canonical auxin signaling pathway 
or the auxin rapid response pathway (Dubey et al., 2021). We examined the involvement of these 
pathways in the establishment of the surface pH profile of the root. First, we investigated the compo-
nents of the canonical auxin signaling by using the tir1,afb2,3 (tir triple) mutant which lacks the 
expression of three of the six known auxin receptors (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). The tir triple mutant 
displayed a more acidic surface pH, particularly in the elongation and maturation zone (Figure 4a 
and b). However, it was still displaying an alkaline domain, albeit less pronounced than the control. In 
response to IAA, tir triple was critically impaired in whole root IAA-­induced surface pH alkalinization 
(Figure 4—figure supplement 1b and c). As a result, tir triple was also impaired in the IAA-­induced 
root growth inhibition (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). These results confirm that the canonical 
auxin signaling is involved in the auxin-­induced apoplastic alkalinization (Li et al., 2021) and also 
partially in the longitudinal surface pH zonation. Next, to test the role of the TMK1-­ABP1 apoplastic 
auxin perception pathway (Li et al., 2021; Friml et al., 2022) in the establishment of root surface pH 
profile, we analyzed the root surface pH profiles of tmk1, tmk4, and abp1 mutants. The surface pH 
profile of the mutants was, however, comparable to the Col-­0 controls (Figure 4—figure supplement 
1d, e and f).
We further explored the role of the recently discovered molecular actors of the auxin rapid response 
- AFB1 and CNGC14. AFB1 is the paralogue of the TIR1 receptor; AFB1 has been shown to be crucial 
for the rapid growth inhibition upon auxin treatment, rapid auxin-­induced membrane depolarization, 
and for the early response to gravistimulation (Prigge et al., 2020; Serre et al., 2021). Similarly, the 
mutant in the calcium channel CNGC14 lacks the auxin-­induced calcium transient, membrane depo-
larization, and shows a delay in the early gravitropic response (Shih et al., 2015; Dindas et al., 2018). 
We analyzed the root surface pH of both mutants and found a more acidic root surface with a critically 
flat alkaline domain in the afb1 mutant (Figure 4c and d and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a) as 
well as in the cngc14 mutant (Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b). We confirmed 
the similar result in additional alleles of afb1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2c) and cngc14 mutants 
(Figure 4—figure supplement 2d). This shows that these proteins, apart from controlling the rapid 
auxin response, steer the pH profile of the root during normal steady-­state growth by controlling the 
alkaline domain in the transition zone. The lack of the alkaline domain was not caused by mislocal-
ization or absence of AUX1 protein in the afb1 or cngc14 mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 
2e). Similarly to the aux1 mutant, the localization of AHA H+ ATPases in both mutants was not obvi-
ously different from the Col-­0 control (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d). We further tested how the 
afb1 and cngc14 mutants respond to IAA and found an overall alkalinization of the root surface with 
a partial rescue of the alkaline domain (Figure 4d and f) and partially impaired growth inhibition 
(Figure 4—figure supplement 2f–h).
What makes the TZ zone surface pH different from the other domains of the roots? A plausible 
explanation is the localization of relevant molecular components in this region of the root. The auxin 
transporters AUX1 and PIN2 have been shown to localize to the lateral root cap and epidermis (Müller 
in (e) control condition and (f) in response to 100 nM IAA. For (b,e,f), the bars above the curves mark regions with non-­significant (ns) and significant (*:

et al., 1998; Swarup et al., 2004, Figure 4g). Prigge et al., 2020, showed that AFB1 is expressed 
in the root tip and we could see an enrichment of the protein in the root epidermis (Figure 4g). To 
determine the localization of CNGC14, we expressed its fluorescently C-­terminally tagged version 
under the control of its native promoter. The expression of CNGC14 fusion protein was rather weak, 
and localized to the PM of root epidermal cells, with an enrichment in the transition zone (Figure 4g 
and h). The expression of AFB1-­mCitrine and CNGC14-­GFP in the respective mutants recovered the 
presence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4c, d, e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a, b 
and d). Interestingly, the expression of CNGC14-­GFP in cngc14 caused an exaggerated TZ alkaline 
domain (Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b and d), which underlines the impor-
tance of the CNGC14 calcium channel in the establishment of root surface pH profile.
These results show that the signaling components so far associated with the rapid auxin response 
are expressed in the root epidermis and contribute to the longitudinal zonation of root surface pH 
profile. The alkaline domain of the TZ represents a site of a constant rapid auxin response that is 
triggered by the internal auxin fluxes mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 transporters. On the other hand, 
the overall increase of root surface pH upon auxin treatment can be attributed to the TIR1 canonical 
signaling pathway.
The AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module facilitates root navigation
It was shown that auxin induces alkalinization of the apoplastic pH and that this alkalinization correlates 
and is required for the inhibition of root growth. The same process occurs during the gravitropic 
response - the lower root side responds to the internal auxin by alkalinization, resulting in root bending 
(Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017). We reanalyzed the root surface 
pH using our pH imaging and quantifications, as it enables us to monitor alkalinization, as well as acid-
ification of the root surface. Upon gravistimulation, the TZ alkaline domain on the lower side of the 
root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface 
acidified (Figure 5a, Video 1). This led to a gradient of surface pH across the root that was established 
within 5 min of the gravistimulation which correlated with initiation of bending of the root (Figure 5a). 
The disappearance of the alkaline halo on the upper root surface indicates that the TZ domain might 
act as a zone of stalled growth which is rapidly activated upon gravistimulation. We further analyzed 
the gravitropic responses of the mutants with altered root surface pH zonation. As expected, the 
agravitropic aux1 mutant did not create a pH gradient across the root and did not bend (Figure 5b). 
Manipulation of the AHA activity by the application of FC or by genetic means did not prevent the 
formation of a gradient of surface pH and rapid bending of the root (Figure 5—figure supplement 
1a and b). Finally, the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a slower gravitropic response, as reported 
before (Serre et al., 2021; Shih et al., 2015; Figure 5c and d). As both mutants have a diminished 
alkaline domain in the TZ, upon gravistimulation, this zone could not rapidly react to change in auxin 
fluxes; instead, a shallow gradient of surface pH slowly develops in the mutants (Figure 5c and d).
We noticed that the alkaline domain showed dynamic fluctuations during vertical growth of the 
WT root (Figure 5e, Video 2), similarly to what was described by Monshausen et al., 2011. In the 
aux1, afb1, and cngc14 mutants, the alkaline domain was absent or less prominent during vertical 
growth (Video 3). This result and the fact that the components of the rapid auxin response pathway

are involved in the formation of the alkaline domain indicates that, in this zone, the cells continuously 
rapidly respond to the internal auxin fluxes, and that this pathway is active not only upon gravistimu-
lation. We hypothesized that the significance of this process is to constantly correct the growth rate 
fluctuations and to enable the root to quickly regulate the growth direction of the root tip. This would 
be particularly relevant in the soil environment, where the root tip penetrates the soil particles and 
constantly corrects growth direction using the gravity vector. To test this hypothesis, we tested the 
ability of WT and aux1, afb1, and cngc14 mutants to navigate through artificial obstacles, approxi-
mated by tilted agar plates covered with a rectangular nylon grid. We scored the efficiency of the 
roots in penetrating the grids with varying pore sizes (Figure 5f). WT plants penetrated the meshes 
more efficiently as the pore size increased, whereas the agravitropic aux1 mutant failed to penetrate 
in all conditions. Interestingly, both the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a significant decrease in 
penetration efficiency compared to the WT (Figure 5g).
In summary, the alkaline surface pH domain originates from a constant rapid auxin response driven 
by the AUX1-­AFB1-­CNGC14 module. This response enables the roots to rapidly react to gravity 
vector changes and to adjust the root tip growth direction.
Discussion
In this work, we present a new method to determine the root surface pH of A. thaliana. Its advantage 
is the sensitivity of FS in lower pH range that enables a spectacular visualization of root surface pH, 
including the acidic domain surrounding the late elongation and maturation zones of roots, which was 
not detected with the previously published methods (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015). FS 
is an inexpensive dye which can be excited by the common 405 and 488 nm laser lines. In this work, we 
avoided measuring absolute pH values; instead, we determined the relative pH compared to internal 
controls observed on the same medium. Absolute 
pH determination would be possible, if extensive 
pH calibration was performed during each imaging 
session. This approach would be very laborious, 
and, in addition, absolute fluorescence intensities 
might depend on the thickness of the layer of

medium and many other parameters. Therefore, 
we recommend using FS to determine relative 
pH changes compared to internal controls, that is 
WT plants or mock controls imaged together with 
mutants or treated roots. We showed that apart 
from pH, FS can also react to other ions, however, 
given that the surface pH profile visualized by FS 
staining is in full accordance with the previously 
published works (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997; 
Weisenseel et al., 1979; Björkman and Leopold, 
1987; Behrens et  al., 1982; Iwabuchi et  al., 
1989; Staal et  al., 2011), we conclude that in 
the growth media, FS reflects primarily the root 
surface pH.
According to the acid growth theory, acidic pH 
enables cell wall extension (Rayle and Cleland, 
1992; Hager, 2003). We observed the lowest pH values in the very tip of the root and in the matu-
ration zone where cells do not elongate. On the other hand, the alkaline domain partially covers the 
early elongation zone. The surface pH therefore does not fully correlate with the local growth rates 
(Beemster and Baskin, 1998; Shih et al., 2015). In addition, it remains to be resolved to what extent 
the surface pH correlates with the pH of the cell walls and the apoplastic space of the root epidermal 
cells, as previous work has reported a correlation between cell length and cell wall pH (Barbez et al., 
2017; Moreau et al., 2022). It is possible that rather than driving cell elongation, the acidic domain 
in the maturation zone plays a role in nutrient acquisition and absorption by the root hairs (Martín-­
Barranco et al., 2021). The cytokinin-­mediated cell wall stiffening may become the dominant growth-­
regulating mechanism in this root zone, leading to growth cessation despite low extracellular pH (Liu 
et al., 2022).
Based on genetic and pharmacological experiments we concluded that the longitudinal surface pH 
zonation is not based solely on the activity and abundance of PM AHA H+ ATPases, but instead, the 
alkaline domain in the transition zone is driven by AUX1-­mediated auxin influx and AFB1 signaling. 
The surface pH might be determined solely by AHA activity in the specific case of the aux1 mutant, 
where the pH progressively decreases in the shootward direction, and might then reflect the AHA 
activity gradient that is determined by the abundance of the proton pumps and their regulation by 
brassinosteroid signaling, as suggested by Großeholz et al., 2022. Interestingly, even in the aux1 
mutant, a residual AHA-­independent alkaline domain is present and can be visualized when AHAs are 
hyperactivated by the application of FC.
In agreement with these results, the ectopic AHA ATPases activation also cannot prevent the 
auxin-­induced growth inhibition and the gravitropic bending of roots. Inhibition of AHA activity led to 
slower growth, a tendency of slower gravitropic response, and the aha2-­4 mutation caused a reduced 
auxin-­induced surface alkalinization. In addition to controlling membrane potential and apoplastic 
pH, AHA activity influences auxin signaling by regulating auxin influx and diffusion into cells (Rubery 
and Sheldrake, 1973; Yang et al., 2006). These results might thus be caused by the reduced proton 
motive force that in turn might interfere with IAA uptake into the cells.
What is the cause of the alkaline domain at the transition zone, if not the inhibition of AHA ATPase 
activity? It was shown that the auxin-­induced apoplast and root surface alkalinization is accompanied 
by a decrease in cytosolic pH (Monshausen et al., 2011; Li et al., 2021), indicating that the alkaline 
domain visualized by the FS is caused by a proton influx into cells. The phenotype of the aux1 mutant 
hints to the possibility that the AUX1-­mediated auxin symport with protons (Lomax et al., 1985) 
might cause the observed root surface alkalinization. Also supporting this hypothesis, the transition 
zone of maize roots is the site of the highest auxin influx, as measured by an auxin-­specific electrode 
(Mancuso et al., 2005). On the other hand, the aux1 mutant was capable of surface alkalinization 
when higher concentrations of IAA were added, demonstrating that the AUX1-­mediated influx per 
se is not required for surface alkalinization. Further, the afb1 mutants show a defect in the alkaline 
domain formation, which favors the explanation that the auxin-­induced alkalinization is triggered from 
the AFB1 receptor. Given that the mutant in CNGC14 is defective in establishing root surface pH

profile, auxin-­induced alkalinization and auxin-­induced calcium influx (Shih et al., 2015), and calcium 
influx and pH changes are tightly coupled (Behera et al., 2018), we conclude that CNGC14 functions 
downstream of AFB1. Similarly, Li et al., 2021, suggested that auxin-­induced alkalinization of the 
apoplast is mediated by a yet unknown mechanism. It is intriguing to speculate that the signaling 
pathway might operate via the adenylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptors (Qi et al., 2022).
We show that the rapid auxin response pathway, so far connected with the reaction to auxin appli-
cation (Fendrych et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021; Monshausen et al., 2011) or the gravitropic response 
(Serre et al., 2021; Shih et al., 2015), operates constantly in the growing A. thaliana root. Even 
though the other TIR1/AFB co-­receptors partially contribute to the longitudinal surface pH zonation, 
AFB1 plays the most important role. The other TIR1/AFB receptors seem to be more important for 
the overall pH rise upon the application of IAA, in agreement with the results of Li et al., 2021. The 
localization of the alkaline zone seems to be determined by the intersection of the PIN2-­mediated 
shootward auxin flux (Luschnig et al., 1998; Müller et al., 1998), localization of the AUX1-­mediated 
auxin influx (Swarup et al., 2005; Band et al., 2014), and the enrichment of the AFB1 and CNGC14 
proteins. We propose that the dynamic nature of the surface alkalinization observed by us and others 
(Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015) results from the interaction of the intensity of the auxin 
flux and the constant rapid response that occurs in the alkaline domain of the root tip. In addition, the 
auxin-­induced alkalinization is constantly being counterbalanced by the TMK-­mediated AHA ATPase 
activation and apoplast acidification (Li et al., 2021; Friml et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2021).
Upon gravistimulation, the alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while 
on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified, which is consistent 
with previous pH measurements done by electrodes (Zieschang et al., 1993; Monshausen et al., 
1996), indicating that the alkaline domain corresponds to a zone of a stalled cell elongation that can 
be rapidly regulated upon gravistimulation. In addition to the gene expression changes that occur 
during obstacle avoidance (Jacobsen et al., 2021) and the FERONIA-­mediated mechanoperception 
(Shih et al., 2014), the rapid auxin response module in the root decreases the reaction time of the 
root to the changes of root growth direction, and thus increases the efficiency of root soil penetration.
Materials and methods
Plant material used
We used the Col-­0 ecotype and the following mutant and transgenic lines. The PIN2>>AHA2delta95, 
PIN2>>PP2C-­D1 originate from this study, see Molecular cloning. Further, we used the aha2-­4 
(SALK_082786), pp2c-­d2/5/6 triple mutant (Ren et  al., 2018) (pp2c-­d2 WsDsLOX493G12, pp2c-­
d5GABI_330E08, and pp2c-­d6 SAIL_171H03), aux1-­100 (SALK_020355), pin2 (NASC_N16706). 
The afb1-­3 and AFB1::AFB1-­mCitrine in afb1-­3 originate from Prigge et  al., 2020. The afb1-­1s 
(SALK_144884C) was genotyped using the following primers SALK_LBb1.3, ​AACG​GAAG​ACTA​
GGAA​GCGA​G, ​GCAA​CAGC​TTCA​AGAC​CTTT​G. The cngc14-­1 (SALK_206460) was genotyped by 
SALK_LBb1.3, ​CACC​TGCT​TGTA​AAGC​AAAG​G, ​TCGG​AACA​ATTG​GCAG​AATA​C; cngc14-­2 (wiscD-
sLox437E09) by WisDsLox_LBP (​AACG​TCCG​CAAT​GTGT​TATT​AAGT​TGTC​), ​TGTT​TCAC​GTAA​AGTC​
AAAC​CC, ​TAAG​AATC​CAAG​TGGC​CACA​C. The CNGC14::CNGC14-­GFP (see Molecular cloning) 
was transformed into the cngc14-­1 and cngc14-­2 homozygous lines. The tir triple is the tir1,afb2,3 
mutant (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). We used the tmk1-­1 (SALK_016360), tmk4-­1 (GABI_348E01) (Li 
et al., 2021), and the abp1-­TD1 (SK21825) (Gao et al., 2015). AUX1::AUX1-­YFP (Swarup et al., 2004) 
was introduced into afb1-­3 and cngc14-­2 by crossing. AUX1::AUX1-­YFP was crossed with PIN::PIN2-­
mCherry (Retzer et al., 2019).
Seeds were surface-­sterilized by chlorine gas for 2 hr. Seeds were sown on 1% (wt/vol) plant agar 
(Duchefa) with ½ Murashige Skoog salts (MS, Duchefa), 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, adjusted to pH 5.8 with 
KOH, and stratified for 2 days at 4°C. Seedlings were vertically grown for 5 days in a growth chamber 
at 23°C by day (16 hr), 18°C by night (8 hr), 60% humidity, and light intensity of 120 µmol photons/
m2/s.
Molecular cloning
The tissue-­specific estradiol-­inducible lines were prepared as follows. For PIN2>>AHA2delta95, we 
cloned the CDS 1-­886 of AHA2 (AT4G30190) lacking the last 95 amino acids as in Pacheco-­Villalobos

et al., 2016, and fused mScarlet-­I (Bindels et al., 2017) to the C-­terminal part. For PIN2>>PP2C-­D1, 
we cloned the CDS of PP2C-­D1 (AT5G02760) and fused mScarlet-­I to the C-­terminal part. Both 
constructs were cloned downstream of the 4xLexA Operon fused to CaMV 35S minimal promoter 
(Sarrion-­Perdigones et al., 2013) and the transcriptional units were terminated by the 35S termi-
nator and cloned into the alpha1-­3 vectors (Dusek et al., 2020). XVE (Zuo et al., 2000) was cloned 
under the control of the PIN2 promoter (1.4 kb upstream of the AT5G57090), terminated by the 
RuBisCo terminator from Pisum sativum and the resulting transcriptional unit was cloned into alpha1-­1 
vector. The alpha transcriptional units were then interspaced with matrix attachment regions (Dusek 
et  al., 2020), combined with a Basta resistance cassette and introduced into the pDGB3omega1 
binary vector (Sarrion-­Perdigones et al., 2013). The CNGC14::CNGC14-­GFP construct contains the 
CNCG14 promoter (1.5  kb upstream of the start codon) and the CNGC14 coding sequence (the 
AT2G24610.1 splice variant) with the GFP fused to the C-­terminus and 35S terminator. This transcrip-
tional unit was combined with a kanamycin resistance cassette and FastRed marker for rapid selection 
of transgenic seeds into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector. All cloning steps were performed using the 
GoldenBraid methodology (Sarrion-­Perdigones et al., 2013; https://gbcloning.upv.es/).
Col-­0 ecotype (PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C-­D1) or cngc14-­1 and cngc14-­2 lines (CNGC14-­
mVenus) were transformed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998).
Pharmacological treatments and dyes
Treatments were prepared using the following chemicals: IAA (10 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma-­Aldrich), 
FC (1 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma-­Aldrich), estradiol (20 mM stock in DMSO; Sigma-­Aldrich). Fluores-
cein Dextran 10,000 MW, Anionic (D1821, Thermo Fisher) - 10 mg/ml stock in miliQ H2O, final concen-
tration in media is 29 µg/ml. Oregon Green 488 Dextran, 10,000 MW (D7170, Invitrogen) - 1 mg/ml 
stock in miliQ H2O, final concentration in media is 2.5 µg/ml. HPTS (H1529, Sigma-­Aldrich), 100 mM 
stock in H2O, final concentration in media is 1 mM. FS (F1130, Thermo Fisher), 100 or 50 mM stock in 
H2O, final concentration in media is 50 µM.
Induction of PIN2>>AHA2delta95 and PIN2>>PP2C-­D1 lines was done by incubating 5-­day-­old 
seedlings for 2.5 hr in 1/2 MS MES buffered media (g/l), 1% sucrose, pH 5.8 containing 2 µM estradiol 
before experiments.
Measurement of FS excitation and emission spectra
For measurement of fluorescent spectra of FS, ½ MS media with 1% sucrose were prepared with pH 
4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 (adjusted with KOH). FS stock (50 mM in H2O) was added to the media to achieve a 
final concentration of 50 µM. For the measurement, 200 µl of this media was pipetted into a 96-­well 
plate, five wells per each pH value and the spectras were measured using Spark multimode microplate 
reader (Tecan). The values for each pH were averaged and plotted.
Measurement of FS range and effects of salts and redox status on FS 
signal
To demonstrate the wide pH-­reporting range of FS (Figure 1c), citric acid and sodium citrate were 
mixed in various ratios and water was added to obtain citrate buffers with a range of pH values. The 
pH of citrate buffers was measured, the buffers were mixed with agar (0.8% final concentration), 
boiled and FS was added (50 µM final concentration). The mixture was poured into a Petri dish. After 
cooling down, slabs of the solidified buffers were cut out, and placed into imaging chambers.
To measure the effects of ions and redox status (according to Martinière et al., 2013) on FS fluo-
rescence (Figure 1—figure supplement 1e), MES buffer (1 g/l) was prepared and boiled with agar 
(1% final concentration), supplied with salts, H2O2, DTT, and FS was added (50 µM final concentration). 
The mixture was poured into a Petri dish. After cooling down, slabs of the solidified buffers were cut 
out, placed into imaging chambers and imaged using a spinning disk microscope, see Imaging of root 
surface pH. The signal intensity was measured in both 405 and 488 nm excitation channels and F488/405 
ratio was calculated.
Imaging of root surface pH
For imaging of surface pH, 5-­day-­old seedlings were transferred to unbuffered ½ MS, 1% sucrose, 
pH 5.7 (adjusted with KOH) containing 50 µM of FS +/-treatments and allowed for recovery 25 min

before imaging. The medium was prepared as follows: For 100 ml of medium, 1 g of plant agar and 
1 g sucrose (wt/vol) were added to 100 ml of unbuffered ½ MS in a 250 ml reagent bottle. The media 
was boiled until the agar was completely dissolved. Note: we always prepared a fresh solid medium 
for each experiment from a stock of liquid ½ MS, sucrose and agar, as re-­boiling the medium might 
affect the results. The medium was cooled to a temperature of 45–50°C and FS was added to achieve 
50 μM concentration. This pre-­solution was then divided into two equal volumes to make control and 
treatment medium.
For the gravitropic experiments, the seedlings were rotated ±90°. Only roots with a starting angle 
of 90°±10° were selected for analysis to obtain homogeneous gravitropic stimulations.
Surface pH imaging was performed using a vertical stage Zeiss Axio Observer 7 with Zeiss Plan-­
Apochromat 10×/0.8, coupled to a Yokogawa CSU-­W1-­T2 spinning disk unit with 50 µm pinholes 
and equipped with a VS401 HOM1000 excitation light homogenizer (Visitron Systems). Images were 
acquired using the VisiView software (Visitron Systems).
FS was sequentially excited with a 488 and 405 nm laser and the emission was filtered by a 
500–550  nm bandpass filter. Signal was detected using a PRIME-­95B Back-­Illuminated sCMOS 
Camera (1200×1200 pixels; Photometrics). The Flat field correction mode was used for image 
acquisition.
For vertical growth experiments, seedlings were imaged every 10 min for 30 min. The profiles 
shown correspond to the first time frame while the root elongation was calculated over the whole 
experiment. Imaging to observe oscillations of the root surface pH was conducted by imaging every 
5 s.
For gravitropic experiments, seedlings were imaged using the sandwich method (https://doi.org/​
10.1017/qpb.2022.4) every 2 min for 42 min. The profile shown corresponds to the last time frame 
except specified otherwise. The angles were quantified over the entire duration of the experiment.
The images in Figure  4g were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope, with a 
25×/0.8 water immersion objective using settings appropriate for the respective fluorophores.
Immunolabeling of AHAs
Whole mount immunolocalization of 5-­day-­old A. thaliana seedlings was performed as described 
previously in Sauer et al., 2006, with the following modifications. The protocol was adapted to the 
InSituPro VS liquid-­handling robot (Intavis AG, Germany). Prior to immunolocalization, seedlings 
were fixed 1 hr with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in MTSB (50 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM 
MgSO4·7H2O pH 7, adjusted with KOH) at room temperature. In the robot, procedure started with 
5×15 min washes with MTSB-­T (MTSB+0.01% Triton X-­100) then the cell wall was digested by 30 min 
treatment at 37°C with 0.05% Pectolyase Y-­23 supplemented with 0.4 M mannitol in MTSB-­T, followed 
by 2×30 min membrane permeation with 10% DMSO and 3% Igepal in MTSB-­T. The samples were 
blocked 1 hr with BSA (blocking solution: 2% BSA in MTSB-­T) and incubated 4 hr at 37°C with primary 
(antiAHA rabbit antibody, Agrisera AS07260, RRID:AB_1031584) and 3 hr at 37°C with secondary anti-
body (Alexa Fluor 555 goat, anti-­rabbit, Abcam ab150078, RRID:AB_2722519). The antibodies were 
diluted in 2% BSA in MTSB-­T in concentration: 1:500 for primary and 1:1000 for secondary antibody. 
Between the all described steps the seedlings were washed 5×15 min with MTSB-­T. For the final step, 
MTSB-­T was exchanged by deionized water. From the robot seedlings were transferred to microscopy 
slides into 50% glycerol in deionized water and fluorescence signal was imaged by Zeiss LSM 880 
inverted confocal scanning microscope equipped with Airyscan detector with 40×/1.2 C-­Apochromat 
objective.
Mesh penetration test
Four-­day-­old seedlings were transferred on ½ MS, 1% (wt/vol) plant agar, 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, pH 5.8, 
covered with sterilized nylon meshes of pore sizes of 109, 119, 139 µm (polyamide mesh UHELON). 
Plates were grown overnight vertically and then were tilted to 45° and grown 24 hr. After that, the 
root penetration through the mesh was scored using a binocular microscope. The penetration effi-
ciency was calculated by normalizing each variant (genotype × pore size) to the Col-­0 efficiency in 
the 139 µm variant in the particular repetition. In addition, the reference Col-­0 was normalized to the 
Col-­0 average over all repeats.

Image analysis
We determined root elongation by measuring the total root length increment between the first and 
last time frame divided by the number of minutes. The root length increment was measured with the 
segmented line in ImageJ/Fiji v1.53f51 (Schindelin et al., 2012). The pH along the root was automat-
ically measured from 10 to 25 pixels off the root surface using custom Python scripts (ATR v5,https://​
sourceforge.net/projects/atr-along-the-root, see Figure 1—figure supplement 1f) averaging bins of 
15*20 pixels from the fluorescence intensity of both 405 and 488 nM channels. Root angles over time 
were automatically measured using ACORBA v1.2 (Serre and Fendrych, 2022). Fluorescence inten-
sity of AFB1-­mCitrine and CNGC14-­GFP was measured as the signal intensity along a segmented 
line that covered the epidermal cell file using Fiji; the intensities were then binned to 10 µm bins and 
plotted.
Statistical analysis and graphics
The averages and SD of surface pH or alkalinization factor in function of the distance from the root tip 
were plotted using the ​Sourcecode1.​py Python script. The root elongation boxplots and the associ-
ated statistics were performed using the Sourcecode2.R: R script.
Statistical analyses were performed using the R software (R v4.0.2 and RStudio v1.3.1073). Boxplots 
represent the median and the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend to data points <1.5 
interquartile range away from the first or third quartile; all data points are shown as individual dots. 
The results of the statistical tests are compiled in Supplemental statistics.
The pH surface profiles and data represented as boxplots were statistically analyzed from genotype 
to genotype or condition to condition using the nparcomp package (Konietschke et al., 2015). For 
two conditions or two genotypes comparisons, we used a non-­parametric Student’s test. For multiple 
comparisons, we used a non-­parametric multi comparison test. For the pH surface profiles, each inde-
pendent data point (a bin of pixels at a defined distance from the root tip) for the control genotype 
or condition were compared the same data point from the other(s) genotype(s) or condition(s) using 
the Sourcecode3.R or Sourcecode4.R R scripts. The results of the statistical tests for all the figures are 
compiled in Source data 1.
Sample size and biological replicates were determined as the maximum number of roots fitting 
the microscopy chamber, this number being influenced by the number of conditions and genotypes 
for a given experiment. Experiment technical replicates were arbitrarily set to three replicates. Fluo-
rescence values were measured blindly by fully automated scripts. Data depicted in this publication 
represent a pool of technical and biological replicates. No technical or biological replicates were 
excluded from this publication.
Graphics were created with the R software or in Python (v3.8) with the Seaborn plugin (v0.11.2, 
https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021) and aesthetic modifications of the graphs (fonts, size) were 
modified in Inkscape (v1.0).
