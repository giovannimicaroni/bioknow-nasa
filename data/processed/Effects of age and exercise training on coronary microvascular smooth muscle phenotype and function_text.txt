japplphysiol.00459.2017.—Coronary microvascular function and blood
ﬂow responses during acute exercise are impaired in the aged heart but
can be restored by exercise training. Coronary microvascular resis-
tance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in
coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age
impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular
smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that
exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-in-
duced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and
old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or
remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage conﬁnement,
contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and ex-
pression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary
arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile func-
tion were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular
smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to
a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle
in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy
chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas
expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribo-
somal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved
contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and ex-
pression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from
old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arteri-
oles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may
contribute to impaired coronary blood ﬂow responses, but arteriolar
contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype
can be restored with late-life exercise training.
NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of
coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle
toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype. Late-life exercise
training reverses contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and
restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth muscle.

INTRODUCTION
Coronary blood ﬂow regulation is achieved by multiple
regulatory responses of the coronary resistance vasculature,
including myogenic vasoconstriction and ﬂow-induced and
metabolic vasodilation (28, 51). Previous work from our lab-
oratory (13) indicates that age impairs coronary blood ﬂow
responses to acute exercise, and this reduction of functional
hyperemia is accompanied by diminished vasodilatory and
contractile responses of coronary resistance arterioles (11,
17, 24, 35). Age-induced loss of vasodilatory function in
coronary arterioles is largely attributable to increased oxi-
dant stress and loss of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation
that can be restored with exercise training (17, 18, 24, 36).
Similarly, Hanna et al. (11) reported that exercise training
reversed age-induced impairment of myogenic responsive-
ness and attenuated age-related remodeling in coronary
arterioles of aged rats; however, the cellular mechanisms
that underlie age- and exercise training-induced alterations
of vascular smooth muscle function in coronary arterioles
have not been identiﬁed.
Vascular smooth muscle remodeling, involving cell prolif-
eration and hypertrophy, is well-documented in large conduit
arteries with age and disease (45); however, the impact of
aging on vascular smooth muscle proliferation in coronary
arterioles has not been investigated. Similarly, the vascular
smooth muscle of aged large arteries has been shown to
convert to a phenotype characterized by increased secretion of
proteins and molecules that promote vascular degeneration
through chronic inﬂammation and extracellular matrix degra-
dation (45, 49); however, whether a phenotypic switch occurs
in the vascular smooth muscle of aged coronary arterioles is
not known. Dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells lose
myoﬁlaments and their contractile ability while also exhibiting
a high rate of proliferation and production of extracellular
matrix proteins (42, 45), alterations that could contribute to
age-induced contractile dysfunction in the coronary microvas-
culature (11). In this study, we investigated whether the vas-
cular smooth muscle of aging coronary arterioles transitions to

a secretory phenotype that manifests in contractile dysfunction.
Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that
adiponectin inhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation
and maintenance of a contractile phenotype in vascular smooth
muscle (3, 6, 8); therefore, we also investigated whether age
and/or exercise training alter adiponectin signaling in coronary
arterioles.
METHODS
Animals. Young (3–4 mo) and old (20–21 mo) male Fisher 344
rats were obtained from the National Institute on Aging. All rats were
housed in a temperature/light-controlled environment and given ac-
cess to standard rat chow and water ad libitum. Rats were randomly
assigned to young sedentary (n  44), young exercise-trained (n 
30), old sedentary (n  39), or old exercise-trained (n  29) groups.
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees at University of Florida and Florida State
University and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health
(8th ed., 2011).
Exercise training. Rats were habituated to treadmill exercise by
walking on the treadmill at 15 m/min (0° incline), 5 min/day, for 3
days. Exercise-trained rats underwent 10–12 wk of treadmill exercise
training. Exercise-trained rats exercised on the treadmill at 15 m/min
(15° incline), 5 days/wk, for 10–12 wk. The duration of exercise was
increased during the initial 4 wk until a 60-min duration was
reached. The rats continued to exercise 5 days/wk for 60 min/day
for the remainder of the 10- to 12-wk training period (11). Only
rats that completed the entire 10-wk training protocol were studied.
Exercise-trained rats were euthanized 24 h after the last exercise
bout to exclude acute effects of exercise (37). To determine the
efﬁcacy of the training protocol, the soleus muscle was stored at
80°C for determination of citrate synthase activity, a mitochon-
drial enzyme and marker of muscle oxidative potential, according
to the method of Srere (38).
Body composition. Body composition was assessed using time-
domain nuclear magnetic resonance with a lean fat analyzer (Bruker
Optics, The Woodlands, TX) at 10 wk. The method was described
previously (41). Two measurements were performed from each ani-
mal, and the average was reported.
Microvessel preparation. Rats were weighed and anesthetized with
3% isoﬂurane-O2 mix and killed by excision of the heart, which was
immediately placed in cold (4°C), ﬁltered physiological saline solu-
tion (PSS) containing 145 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.0 mM CaCl2,
1.17 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 5.0 mM glucose, 2.0 mM
pyruvate, 0.02 mM EDTA, 3.0 mM MOPS buffer, and 1% bovine
serum albumin. Coronary resistance arterioles were isolated from the
left anterior descending artery distribution. In some arterioles, the
endothelium was removed by passing 5 ml of air through the lumen
without causing damage to vascular smooth muscle. Arterioles were
then cannulated on pipettes and pressurized to 60 cmH2O (corre-
sponding to an intraluminal pressure of 40–50 mmHg) in a Lucite
chamber that contained warm (37°C), ﬁltered PSS. The chamber was
then placed on an inverted microscope equipped with a video camera
and micrometer to measure intraluminal diameter. Coronary arterioles
with no leaks were warmed to 37°C and allowed to equilibrate for
~1 h or until developing 15% spontaneous tone. The bathing
solution was changed every 20 min during the course of each exper-
iment. Lack of vasodilation to 50 M acetylcholine conﬁrmed re-
moval of the endothelium. At the end of all experiments, arterioles
were placed in Ca2-free PSS with 100 M sodium nitroprusside to
determine maximal diameter. Development of spontaneous tone was
expressed as the percentage constriction relative to maximal diameter
and calculated as follows:
spontaneous tone %  Dmax  Ds ⁄ Dmax  100,
where Dmax is the maximal inner diameter recorded at a pressure of
60 cmH2O under Ca2-free conditions and Ds is the steady-tone
baseline diameter.
Evaluation of vasoconstrictor responsiveness. To determine recep-
tor-independent and -dependent vasoconstrictor responsiveness, con-
centration-response curves to K and the thromboxane analog,
U46619 (1E9 to 1E4 M), were assessed. Responses to U46619 were
assessed in both denuded and intact coronary arterioles. Reponses to
depolarizing concentrations of K (10–100 mM, isotonic substitution
for Na) were assessed in denuded coronary arterioles as previously
described (35).
Immunohistochemistry. To determine whether aging and exercise
training alter smooth muscle cell phenotype, coronary arterioles were
cannulated, pressurized to 60 cmH2O, warmed to 37°C, incubated in
Ca2-free PSS and 100 M sodium nitroprusside for 1 h, and then
ﬁxed in 50% Bouin solution. Fixed arterioles were frozen in optimum
cutting temperature compound and stored at 80°C until use. Five-
micrometer sections of coronary arterioles were cut on a cryostat.
After washing with PSS, arteriolar sections were blocked using 0.3%
Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum at room temperature for
1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies against smooth muscle
-actin (1:50; cat. no. ab18147; Abcam) and phospho-histone H3
(PHH3; 1:100; #9701; Cell Signaling Technology) at 4°C for over-
night. After washing, species-speciﬁc anti-IgG (Texas Red, cat. no.
ab7059, Abcam; FITC, cat. no. ab6785, Abcam) were added at a
dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. After ﬁnal washing and
blotting of any excess PSS, mounting media containing 4=,6=-di-
amidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; cat. no. P36962; Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc) was applied to identify TA-rich regions of DNA in nuclei, and
images were obtained using a ﬂuorescence microscope (BX43; Olym-
pus, Tokyo, Japan). The area of smooth muscle -actin staining was
determined via color threshold using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick,
MA). DAPI-stained nuclei were identiﬁed by a MATLAB program
based on a threshold value for intensity and size. Nuclei speciﬁcally
within the smooth muscle cross-sectional area (smooth muscle nuclei)
were identiﬁed by superimposing DAPI and smooth muscle-stained
images. Proliferating smooth muscle nuclei were determined based on
positive staining for PHH3 via color threshold. Proliferating state was
assessed by calculating the ratio of PHH3-positive smooth muscle
nuclei to total number of smooth muscle nuclei. The average of the
values obtained from analysis of four consecutive cross-sections per
vessel was calculated and used for statistical analysis.
Adiponectin receptor 1. To determine whether age and exercise
training alter expression of adiponectin receptor 1 subtype in coronary
arterioles, 5-m frozen cross-sections of arterioles were thawed and
washed with phosphate-buffered saline before adding the blocking
solution of 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum at room
temperature for 1 h. Then, the arterioles were incubated with primary
antibodies against adiponectin receptor 1 (Anti-Adiponectin Receptor
1; 1:50; cat. no. ab126611; Abcam) at 4°C overnight. After PBS
washes, species-speciﬁc anti-IgG (FITC; cat. no. ab6785; Abcam) was
added at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. After
washing, DAPI (cat. no. P36962; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) was
added, and images were obtained using a ﬂuorescence microscope
(BX43; Olympus). To exclude adventitial staining, a region of interest
for adiponectin receptor 1 staining was established manually using
ImageJ after isolating the images for green ﬂuorescence only. For
each section, the average pixel intensity in the region of interest was
obtained (ImageJ). Background subtraction was performed by sub-
tracting the average pixel intensity obtained in an adjacent section
from the same vessel that had treated in the same manner as the
stained sections but in the absence of primary or secondary antibody.
The average of the values obtained from analysis of three to ﬁve
cross-sections per vessel was calculated and used for statistical anal-
ysis.

Immunoblotting. The differentiation state of smooth muscle cells
was determined by assessing expression of smooth muscle-speciﬁc
contractile proteins smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms 1
(SM1) and 2 (SM2) in coronary arterioles (20, 22). The levels of
downstream effectors of adiponectin, AMP-activated kinase (2, 6, 8,
14, 29, 32, 39) and ribosomal protein S6 (12, 33), were assessed.
Coronary arterioles (n  5/rat) branching from the left anterior
descending artery were dissected and stored at 80°C until use.
Pooled vessels from each rat were lysed in 25 l of 1 sample buffer
(62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6 M urea, 160 mM DTT, 0.1%
bromophenol blue) and loaded (10-g total protein) to 10% SDS-
polyacrylamide gel. Proteins then were transferred to Hybond ECL
membranes (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). After 1-h blocking in
5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20,
membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies
for the following proteins: SM1 (0.6 g/ml), SM2 (0.6 g/ml), S6
ribosomal protein (1:250; #2217; Cell Signaling Technology), phos-
pho-S6 ribosomal protein (1:250; #2215; Cell Signaling Technology),
AMP-activated kinase- (AMPK; 1:250; #2532; Cell Signaling Tech-
nology), and -actin (1:250; #4967; Cell Signaling Technology).
After washing, membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit horserad-
ish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000; #7074; Cell
Signaling Technology) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Peroxidase
activity was determined using SuperSignal West Femto (Pierce), and
images were analyzed using ImageJ. Loading differences were nor-
malized by expressing all data as relative densitometry units of the
protein of interest vs. -actin.
Adiponectin ELISA. To determine whether aging and exercise
training alter global circulating level of adiponectin, ELISA (cat. no.
22-ADPRT-E01; ALPCO) was used for quantitative determination of
adiponectin in rat serum. Blood was collected in serum separator tubes
from the tail vein at the time of death. Serum was obtained by
centrifuge at 4°C for 5 min and kept in 80°C until use. ELISA was
performed following manufacturer’s instruction, and the plate was
read on SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices).
Data analysis and statistics. Vasoconstrictor responses were ex-
pressed as percentage constriction according to the following formula:
constriction %  Db – Ds ⁄ Db  100,
where Db is the baseline diameter immediately before addition of the
ﬁrst dose of vasoconstrictor agonist and Ds is the steady-state diameter
measured after addition of each dose. Vessel responses to U46619 and
K were evaluated using three-way ANOVA (age, exercise training,
and dose/time) with repeated measurement (dose/time). Group differ-
ences in animal and vessel characteristics, body composition, circu-
lating adiponectin, and values obtained from immunohistochemical
and immunoblot analyses were assessed by two-way ANOVA (age
and exercise training). Post hoc analyses were performed using
Bonferroni test for pairwise comparisons if either signiﬁcant main
effects or signiﬁcant interactions were found. Statistical signiﬁcance
was deﬁned as P  0.05. All data are presented as means 	 SE.
RESULTS
Animal and vessel characteristics. Body weight increased
with age (Table 1). Exercise training reduced body weight in
both young and old rats. Both heart weight and left ventricular
weight increased with age (Table 1). Heart weight-to-body
weight ratio increased with exercise training in young and old
rats. Exercise training increased soleus muscle citrate synthase
activity by 20.9% in young rats [23.2 	 1.1 vs. 19.1 	 0.5
mol·min1·g1; young exercise-trained group (YET) vs.
young sedentary group (YSED)] and by 30.3% [18.5 	 0.9 vs.
13.6 	 0.7 mol·min1·g1; old exercise-trained group (OET)
vs. old sedentary group (OSED)] in old rats, conﬁrming the
efﬁcacy of the exercise training regimen, as previously dem-
onstrated (11, 36). Coronary arterioles that were 
150 m in
diameter were isolated from the left ventricular free wall in all
rats, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in arteriolar
diameters between groups. Spontaneous tone, assessed before
addition of any contractile agents, did not differ between
arterioles from young and old rats. Exercise training enhanced
spontaneous tone in both young and old rats, consistent with
our (11) previously reported observations.
Vasoconstrictor responses to U46619. To determine initially
the effects of aging and exercise training on contractile func-
tion of coronary arterioles, we assessed vasoconstrictor re-
sponses to the thromboxane analog, U46619, in intact coronary
arterioles.
Aging

U46619 (Fig. 1A). Exercise training completely restored vaso-
constrictor responses to U46619 in intact coronary arterioles
from old rats, whereas contractile responsiveness to U46619
was reduced after exercise training in intact arterioles from
young rats (Fig. 1A). To assess speciﬁcally contractile re-
sponses of the vascular smooth muscle, we evaluated contrac-
tile responses to U46619 in coronary arterioles denuded of
endothelium. Removal of the endothelium reduced contractile
responses to U46619 in arterioles from YSED rats but did not
affect contractile responses in arterioles from OSED rats (Fig.
1, A vs. B). As in intact arterioles, aging nearly eliminated
contractile responses to U46619 (Fig. 1B), and exercise train-
ing reversed the age-induced loss of U46619-mediated con-
tractile responses of smooth muscle (Fig. 1B). In denuded
arterioles from young rats, exercise training tended to reduce
responsiveness to low concentrations of U46619, but the over-
all concentration-response relationship was not different be-
tween arterioles from YSED and YET rats. These data are
consistent with an age-induced reduction of contractile re-
sponses in arteriolar smooth muscle and a training-induced
reversal of this loss of contractile function.

striction of the smooth muscle in coronary arterioles, we
evaluated constrictor responses to increasing concentrations of
potassium chloride (KCl; substituted for sodium chloride to
maintain osmolarity and ionic balance). Aging decreased va-
soconstrictor responses to KCl in denuded coronary arterioles
from OSED rats relative to YSED rats (Fig. 2). In arterioles
from old rats, exercise training restored vasoconstriction to
KCl to a level not different from that of arterioles from YSED
rats. In arterioles from young rats, exercise training did not
alter responsiveness to KCl. These data further indicate that
aging reduces contractile function of coronary arterioles, inde-
pendent of membrane receptor signaling.
Vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype. With age, vascular
smooth muscle in coronary arterioles displayed a synthetic,
dedifferentiated phenotype. Smooth muscle myosin, SM1, de-
creased in coronary arterioles with age (Fig. 3A). Exercise
training increased SM1 protein levels in arterioles from old
rats, although a signiﬁcant difference persisted between SM1
proteins in arterioles from YET and OET rats. SM2 levels were
similar among all four groups of rats (Fig. 3B). Age increased
levels of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) in
coronary arterioles (Fig. 4A). Exercise training decreased the
level of rpS6 in arterioles from old rats (Fig. 4A). Phosphory-
lation of rpS6 also increased with age but was reduced by
exercise training in arterioles from old rats (Fig. 4B). Exercise
training did not change total or phosphorylated rpS6 in arteri-
oles from young rats.
Phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells. Figure 5A shows
representative cross-sections of coronary arterioles demonstrat-
ing DAPI-stained nuclei (a, e, i, and m), smooth muscle -actin
staining (b, f, j, and n), and phospho-histone H3-stained nuclei
(PHH3; c, g, k, and o). Aging reduced the number of nuclei per
cross-sectional unit of vascular smooth muscle (Fig. 5B). After
exercise training, the age-related difference in number of
nuclei in the media of the arteriolar wall was no longer
detectable (Fig. 5B). Aging increased smooth muscle cell
proliferation (Fig. 5C). Exercise training decreased smooth
muscle cell proliferation in arterioles from old but not young
rats (Fig. 5C).
Body composition, serum adiponectin, AMPK, and R1 adi-
ponectin receptor subtype. During the 10-wk training period,
YSED rats gained weight, whereas OSED rats lost weight (Fig.
6A). Compared with YSED rats, YET gained signiﬁcantly less
weight (Fig. 6A). OET rats lost signiﬁcantly more weight
compared with OSED in the 10-wk training period (Fig. 6A).

Fat mass and percentage of fat mass increased with age (Fig. 6,
B and C). Absolute lean mass increased with age (Fig. 6D), but
percentage of lean mass decreased with age (Fig. 6E). Exercise
training reduced the percentage of fat mass (Fig. 6C) and
increased the percentage of lean mass in both young and old
rats (Fig. 6E).
Age decreased circulating adiponectin (Fig. 7A). Exercise
training increased circulating adiponectin in both young and
old rats (Fig. 7A). Expression of AMPK, which is activated by
adiponectin in vascular smooth muscle (8), was decreased by
50% in denuded coronary arterioles from aged rats (Fig. 7B).
Exercise training increased AMPK levels in coronary arterioles
from old rats Fig. 7B); however, the levels in arterioles from
old exercise-trained rats did not reach those of arterioles from
young rats. Exercise training did not alter AMPK levels in
arterioles from young rats (Fig. 7B).
Age decreased R1 adiponectin receptor subtype (AdipoR1)
receptor levels (Fig. 7, C and D). Exercise training did not alter
AdipoR1 levels in coronary arterioles from old rats. Surpris-
ingly, exercise training decreased AdipoR1 levels in coronary
arterioles from young rats (Fig. 7, C and D).
DISCUSSION
Our (11, 23, 35) previous work has shown that myogenic
constriction and contractile responses to endothelin are im-
paired in coronary arterioles with advancing age. Our current
ﬁndings conﬁrm that contractile responses of coronary arteri-
oles decline with age, but the loss of contractile function can be
restored with late-life exercise training. Age reduces both
thromboxane receptor-mediated vasoconstriction and receptor-
independent constriction mediated by depolarizing concentra-
tions of potassium chloride. Additionally, both receptor-depen-
dent and receptor-independent vasoconstrictor responses were
improved after late-life exercise training, suggesting that exer-
cise training restores function of the intracellular contractile
mechanisms in the vascular smooth muscle of coronary arte-
rioles. These effects of age and exercise training on vasocon-
strictor responses were also present in denuded arterioles,
supporting the conclusion that late-life exercise training alters
contractile function of arteriolar smooth muscle independent of
changes in the endothelium. Importantly, our data indicate that
an age-induced shift away from a differentiated, contractile

AGE, EXERCISE TRAINING, AND ARTERIOLAR SMOOTH MUSCLE

smooth muscle phenotype toward a secretory, synthetic phe-
notype underlies contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles,
but this phenotypic shift can be reversed by late-life exercise
training.
Here, we conﬁrm our (11) previous work in which we found
that exercise training reversed age-related thickening of the
medial wall in coronary arterioles and ameliorated myogenic
responses of coronary arterioles from aged rats. We (11)
reported that age induces remodeling of the coronary arteriolar
wall as evidenced by an increase in wall-to-lumen ratio that is
accompanied by reduced wall stiffness but without a change in
the collagen-to-elastin ratio. We now report that with age, the
vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles undergoes a loss
of contractile protein expression and an increase in expression
of ribosomal protein S6, a key synthetic protein, suggesting
that the increase in wall thickness that occurs with age in these
arterioles results from a phenotypic switch in which the vas-
cular smooth muscle cells lose contractile stiffness and become
increasingly synthetic and hypertrophic. In large arteries, a
similar phenotypic switch to a synthetic, secretory phenotype
of vascular smooth muscle occurs with age and is accompanied
by increased medial proliferation (10, 43, 44, 46); however, in
large arteries, increased collagen secretion is a signiﬁcant
contributor to the age-related increase in wall stiffness (16).
Importantly, in resistance arterioles that are critical for regu-
lation of coronary blood ﬂow distribution, the switch from a
contractile to a synthetic phenotype in the vascular smooth
muscle corresponds to a loss of functional contractility, possi-
bly contributing to the microvascular dysfunction that occurs in
the coronary circulation with age (13).
The previously reported medial thickening and reduction of
stiffness in aged coronary arterioles (11) may result, in part,
from a shift to a synthetic phenotype that lacks stiffness due to
a reduction of contractile elements in the smooth muscle cells,
per se (Fig. 3). The level of contractile protein SM1 was
reduced in coronary arterioles by aging. Dedifferentiated vas-
cular smooth muscle cells in a synthetic state demonstrate an
extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and a large Golgi
complex, synthesizing extracellular matrix proteins and new
proteins for cell proliferation (4). In addition to decreasing
contractile protein expression, aging increased the levels of
rpS6, an important regulator of protein synthesis and cell size
(33), and also increased phosphorylation of rpS6 in the vascu-
lar smooth muscle of coronary arterioles. Late-life exercise
training reversed these age-induced phenotypic changes in the
smooth muscle and restored contractile function in aged arte-
rioles. Indolﬁet al. (15) demonstrated that exercise training
reduced vascular smooth muscle proliferation and restenosis of
common carotid arteries after balloon angioplasty and stenting;
however, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that exercise
training can restore a differentiated, contractile phenotype in
the smooth muscle of the aged vascular wall.
In our (11) previous work, the increase in wall-to-lumen
ratio that occurred with age was reversed by exercise training.
In humans, bicycle exercise training has been reported to
induce a signiﬁcant and gradual decrease in wall thickness and
wall-to-lumen ratio in both the femoral and carotid arteries,
suggesting that exercise training can lead to remodeling of the
arterial wall through a systemic mechanism (40). It is possible
that age- and exercise training-induced changes in blood pres-

sure could contribute to vascular remodeling; however, we (13)
have previously found that neither age nor exercise training
altered blood pressure in Fischer 344 rats. Therefore, to inves-
tigate one potential systemic mechanism that may contribute to
the age- and exercise training-induced phenotypic shifts in the
vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles, we studied
circulating adiponectin and its downstream effector, AMP-
activated protein kinase (AMPK). Kim et al. (19) demonstrated
that increased body weight and increased abdominal visceral
fat were important predictors of decreased serum adiponectin
concentration in nondiabetic, obese aged subjects. In both
humans and in animal models, weight loss and exercise train-
ing increase circulating adiponectin (9, 21, 27, 47). This
inverse relationship between body fat and circulating adiponec-
tin was conﬁrmed by our results in which body fat increased in
old rats, whereas circulating adiponectin decreased with ad-
vancing age. In accordance with reports in the literature, we
found that exercise training reduced body fat but increased
circulating adiponectin in both young and old rats. Adiponectin
is produced in various tissues, including adipose tissue, cardiac

myocytes, aorta, and vascular smooth muscle (8, 25, 30, 39).
Adiponectin has been reported to induce differentiation of
vascular smooth muscle via AMPK2-mediated inhibition of
molecular target of rapamycin and its effector, S6 kinase-1,
which phosphorylates rpS6 (8). Adiponectin attenuates trans-
formation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like
cells that contribute to vascular calciﬁcation and arterial plaque
formation (50) through its action on the AMPK-molecular
target of rapamycin signaling, and serum adiponectin levels
negatively correlate with the degree of coronary artery calci-
ﬁcation (26). We found that AMPK protein levels decreased in
coronary arterioles with age, suggesting that the age-related
reduction in systemic adiponectin as well as reduced AMPK
signaling may contribute to the phenotypic changes that oc-
curred in vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles with
age.
Two adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, as well
as T-cadherin bind adiponectin and are expressed in the endo-
thelium and vascular smooth muscle (1, 34). AdipoR1 is
upregulated by exercise training in soleus muscle of obese rats
(5). Exercise training-induced hippocampal neurogenesis has
been linked to adiponectin signaling through AdipoR1 (48). In
contrast, deﬁciency of AdipoR1 did not affect vascular recov-
ery from peripheral ischemia, whereas mice deﬁcient in Adi-
poR2 displayed a marked impairment of revascularization in
hindlimb ischemia (31). Our results indicate that a decrease in
AdipoR1 occurred with age in the wall of coronary arterioles;
however, exercise training did not increase AdipoR1 in wall of
coronary arterioles from old rats. Surprisingly, AdipoR1 levels
decreased with exercise training in coronary arterioles from
young rats. It is possible that these age- and exercise training-
induced changes in AdipoR1 occur in conjunction with
changes in AdipoR2, which we did not investigate. It is also
possible that the high levels of circulating adiponectin that
were found in young, exercise-trained rats leads to downregu-
lation and/or altered distribution of AdipoR1 in the vascular
wall. These arteriolar cross-sections contain both endothelium
and vascular smooth muscle, and the levels of AdipoR1 in
these respective cells may change in a directionally similar
manner with age and exercise. Alternatively, the changes in
AdipoR1 levels may be directionally opposite in endothelium
and vascular smooth muscle and may be related to the reduc-
tion of endothelium-mediated constriction to U46619 that
occurred with exercise training in arterioles from young, but
not old, rats. Future work will need to address the role of local
adiponectin signaling in arterioles and cell-speciﬁc adaptations

of adiponectin signaling that occur in arterioles with age and
exercise training.
In summary, age impairs contractile responses of coronary
arterioles and induces a shift of the arteriolar smooth muscle
toward a secretory, synthetic phenotype in which expression of
contractile proteins is reduced. Late-life exercise training re-
verses contractile impairment and restores a younger, contrac-
tile phenotype to the smooth muscle of coronary arterioles.
Reduction of circulating adiponectin and decreased local adi-
ponectin signaling may contribute to phenotypic changes that
occur in the smooth muscle of coronary arterioles with age and
exercise training.
