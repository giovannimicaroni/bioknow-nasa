Abstract
The 14-3-3 proteins speciﬁcally bind a number of client proteins to inﬂuence important pathways, including
ﬂowering timing via the photosensory system. For instance, 14-3-3 proteins inﬂuence the photosensory system
through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further
studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The
14-3-3 m T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3m-1, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length
could be inﬂuenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 n T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when
grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root
greening compared with the wild type, which was inﬂuenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond
10 d of growth, 14-3-3m-1 roots did not increase in greening as much as wild-type roots. This study reveals new
developmental roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory
system.
Key words: Chloroplast, photosensory system, plastid, 14-3-3 proteins, root development.
Introduction
The 14-3-3 proteins are predominantly known for their
ability to bind certain phosphorylated proteins to complete
phosphoregulation events (Ferl, 1996). In plants, 14-3-3
protein binding activity includes the regulation of key
metabolic enzymes, such as nitrate reductase and sucrose
synthase (Bachmann et al., 1996; Toroser et al., 1998), and
also the activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase
(Olsson et al., 1998; Fuglsang et al., 1999; Svennelid et al.,
1999; Ottmann et al., 2007). Throughout eukaryotes, 14-3-3
proteins are known to bind a multitude of different proteins
and, speciﬁcally, participate in a wide array of signal
transduction regulatory events.
Multicellular eukaryotes contain multiple 14-3-3 protein
family members, or isoforms. The number of 14-3-3 isoforms
can vary per organism, but Arabidopsis contains 13 expressed
14-3-3 genes (Wu et al., 1997; Rosenquist et al., 2001; Sehnke
et al., 2006). The 14-3-3 proteins throughout eukaryotes share
sequence homology within the core region of the protein
sequence, but sequences of individual isoforms diverge in the
amino-
and
carboxy-terminal
tails.
The
importance
of
multiple 14-3-3 isoforms per organism remains to be eluci-
dated, however, reverse genetic studies analysing knockout or
knock down mutants continue to identify speciﬁc roles of
individual 14-3-3 isoforms (Su et al., 2001; Sugiyama et al.,
2003; Mayﬁeld et al., 2007; Purwestri et al., 2009).
In Arabidopsis, 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were
utilized to ﬁnd association of the 14-3-3 isoforms l and t
with both light sensing during early development and time of
transition to ﬂowering (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007). Red light-
grown 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants exhibit decreased

hypocotyl elongation inhibition (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007)
reminiscent of, but not identical to Phytochrome B (PHYB)
mutants (Koornneef et al., 1980). The 14-3-3 T-DNA
insertion mutants also ﬂower later in long-day conditions
(16 h of light), but not in short-day conditions (8 h of light)
(Mayﬁeld et al., 2007). In rice, the opposite phenotype occurs
when manipulating expression of the 14-3-3 isoform, GF14c
(Purwestri et al., 2009). Over-expression of GF14c results in
delayed ﬂowering, while knockout results in early ﬂowering.
These 14-3-3 mutant phenotypes indicate a role in light-
related signalling for these particular 14-3-3 isoforms. The
relationship of 14-3-3 proteins with light signalling is further
supported by the observation that 14-3-3 proteins bind the
blue light photoreceptor Phototropin 1 (PHOT1) (Kinoshita
et al., 2003) and the ﬂowering timing regulation protein
Constans (CO) (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007), as well as downstream
targets such as Flowering Timing (FT) and Self-Pruning (SP)
(Pnueli et al., 2001).
Light perception is broadly important for phototropic
responses, time of ﬂowering, and root development. For
example, Red and far-red light inﬂuence the directional
growth of roots. Roots of some plants, such as maize and
rice, grow horizontally in the dark, but grow downward
when the plants are irradiated with red or far-red light from
above (Takano et al., 2001; Lu et al., 1996). In addition, there
is copious expression of photoreceptors in the roots (Pratt and
Coleman, 1974; Somers and Quail, 1995; Toth et al., 2001),
suggesting a functional relevance for photoreceptors in root
development. Root hair development is enhanced by light and
mediated by phytochromes (De Simone et al., 2000a, b).
Further, both Phytochrome A (PHYA) and PHYB regulate
red-light-induced root hair development while far-red-induced
root hair development is regulated by PHYA alone (De
Simone et al., 2000a).
Photoreceptors also control chloroplast development in
roots that are exposed to light. Prolonged exposure of plant
roots to light stimulates the development of chloroplasts in
the roots (Whatley, 1983). Chloroplast development in the
roots is stimulated by red and blue light, with cryptochrome
1 and 2 (CRY1 and CRY2) as the primary regulators of
blue light-stimulated chloroplast development and PHYB as
the primary regulator in red light (Usami et al., 2004).
This
study utilizes
the
previously described T-DNA
insertion mutants of 14-3-3 l and t to examine the roles of
individual 14-3-3 isoforms in root elongation and chloroplast
development, that are controlled by the photosensory system.
A 14-3-3l knockdown mutant containing a T-DNA insertion
within the promoter of 14-3-3l, 14-3-3l-1 (Mayﬁeld et al.,
2007), exhibited shorter roots whose lengths were inﬂuenced
by various light intensities. The 14-3-3t knockout T-DNA
insertion mutants, 14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2 (Mayﬁeld et al.,
2007), each contain a T-DNA insertion within the 14-3-3t
coding region and also had shorter roots than the wild type,
but only when grown under narrow bandwidth red light. In
addition, the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants
and CO mutants (co) (co-1; Redei, 1962; Koornneef et al.,
1991) exhibited an increase in chloroplast numbers after 5 d
of growth.
Materials and methods
Growth conditions of Arabidopsis seedlings
Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized as previously described by Paul
et al. (2001). Thirty to forty seeds of each line were planted onto
0.53 MS vertical plates, which consisted of 0.22% MS salts
(Murashige and Skoog, 1962), 0.025% MES buffer, 0.5% sucrose,
0.1% 10003 MS vitamins (Murashige and Skoog, 1962), and 0.8%
agar. Nitrate-free media were prepared as above, except that the
MS salt mix was substituted for nitrogen-free MS salt mix
(Product #MSP007; Caisson Laboratories, Logan, UT), 1 mM
ammonium citrate was added and the media was adjusted to a pH
of 6.5. After planting, the seed-containing plates were incubated at
4 C in the dark for 48 h. The plates were then placed under the
appropriate light conditions. Constant-light-grown seedlings were
grown under a light bank emitting 60–70 lmol m2 s1 of light
(two Cool White Sylvania bulbs and two Gro-Lux bulbs).
Constant red light (630 nm at 25 lmol m2 s1), blue light
(470 nm at 40 lmol m2 s1) or dark-grown plants were exposed
to white light for 1 h, after the 48 h cold treatment, and placed
under Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) or in the dark. Treatments
included irradiation with speciﬁc ﬂuence rates of red light (630 nm;

Devices,

or
blue
light
(470
nm;
Ledtronics Inc, Torrance CA), and a custom design used by Folta
et al. (2005).
Characterization of phyB mutants

Salk_022035 and Salk_069700 were obtained from the Arabidopsis
Biological Resource Center. The seeds were planted on wet Fafard
Fine-germinating Mix soil and incubated at 4 C in the dark for
3 d. The seeds were exposed to light for 1 h to promote
germination, then placed under ;20 lmol m2 s1 of narrow-
bandwidth red light for 4 d. All seedlings were cleared from the
soil that did not exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition.
The remaining seedlings that did exhibit reduced hypocotyl
elongation inhibition were later screened for homozygous T-DNA
insertion using PCR. A left border T-DNA speciﬁc primer (LBb1)
and two, T-DNA ﬂanking, PHYB gene-speciﬁc primers were used
to identify lines that were homozygous for T-DNA insertion into
the respective 14-3-3 genes. It is important to add that 100% of the
lines,
from
both Salk_022035 and Salk_069700,
selected
as
exhibiting reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition were identiﬁed
as homozygous PHYB T-DNA insertion mutants.
The phenotypes exhibited by Salk_022035 and Salk_069700 in
this study were comparable between the two separate lines. In
order to make the data easier to convey, only the phenotypic data
of Salk_022035 were included in the results and discussion of this
study.
Root and chloroplast measurements
Digital images of roots were captured using an Epson Perfection
3170 Photo scanner for further analysis. Root lengths were
assessed by measuring root lengths of each Arabidopsis line of
wild-type, Res-mu, and 14-3-3l-1 with the University of Texas
Health Science Center San Antonio Dental School (UTHSCSA)

The root measurements collected were standardized and processed
in Microsoft Excel.
Visualization of Arabidopsis roots with a ﬂuorescent microscope
Roots were viewed with an Olympus BX51 ﬂuorescent microscope
coupled to an Evolution MP cooled charge-coupled device camera
with Q-capture 2.60 software (Quantitative Imaging, Burnaby,
British Columbia, Canada). Digital photos were taken through
a 103 objective and captured with no binning. Regions identical in
size were cropped from the digital images taken of roots from each

Arabidopsis line. Slides were prepared by mounting the roots in
water between a slide and cover slip.
Visualization of Arabidopsis roots with a confocal microscope
Roots from 5-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings were viewed with
a confocal LSM5 Pascal Laser Scanning Microscope (Zeiss, Jena,
Germany). The light source used was a helium neon laser emitting
543 nm light. The light emitted by the helium neon laser was
ﬁltered with a long pass ﬁlter resulting in a wavelength of 560 nm,
similar to the conditions used to view rhodamine. Images were
collected of the red ﬂuorescing chloroplast, as well as Differential
Interference Contrast (DIC) images to provide a reference for root
size and shape.
Quantiﬁcation of the red tonal levels of Arabidopsis roots
Four or more ﬂuorescent microscope images of chloroplasts in
root tissue were cropped in order to standardize the images to
equal sizes using Adobe Photoshop. The standardized images were
then processed with the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of Image
J. Tonal levels recorded by the RGB Measure Plus plug-in were then
processed with Microsoft Excel.
Results
14-3-3l-1 has shorter roots than wild-type
Wild-type and 14-3-3l-1 were grown on vertical MS media
agar plates under constant light conditions and assayed for
root lengths after 8 d of growth (Fig. 1). The roots of
14-3-3l-1, co, and phyB were statistically shorter than
wild-type levels (a¼9.00631061, 0.0011, and 3.74431013,
respectively). The 14-3-3l-1 roots were only ;25% of wild-
type root length (Fig. 1A, B), although developmentally
similar in the aerial tissue. Wild-type root length was
restored by the reintroduction of 14-3-3l in Res-mu, a 14-3-
3l-1 line that was complemented by the native 14-3-3 l
gene (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007) (Fig. 1B, C). Root lengths of
14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2 were also comparable with that of
wild-type roots after 8 d of growth (Fig. 1B, C).
The root growth results for 14-3-3l-1 were in stark contrast
to the results for 14-3-3t insertion mutants. Two separate
T-DNA insertion alleles for 14-3-3t showed wild-type root
Fig. 1. Shorter root lengths of 14-3-3l-1 compared with wild-type root lengths. After 8 d of growth, 14-3-3l-1 exhibited shorter roots
than wild-type (A). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates in
constant light. The average root lengths after 8 d of growth were measured (B). The roots of 14-3-3l-1 and phyB were ;30% and
;70% of the wild-type root length, while other lines were equal in root length to wild-type (B). Error bars represent standard error and
asterisks indicate lines with a signiﬁcant difference in root length compared to wild-type using a t test (B). The root lengths of the 14-3-3
T-DNA insertion mutants and the wild type were measured daily in order to get a time-course of root lengths (C). 14-3-3l-1 exhibited
shorter roots that consistently increase in the deviation from wild-type root lengths through 8 d of growth. Error bars represent standard
error (B, C).

lengths under constant light conditions. CO also exhibited
wild-type root length, while phyB had a slightly decreased
root length (Fig. 1B).
The time-course of root length was studied to determine
if there was a particular time point that 14-3-3l-1 root
length begins to deviate from that of the wild type and
Res-mu, or the two alleles of 14-3-3t. Root lengths were
measured daily over 8 d of growth (Fig. 1C). 14-3-3l-1
exhibited an overall slower increase in root length through-
out the entire 8 d compared with the wild type, with no
particular day characterized as a speciﬁc point of separation
of 14-3-3l-1 from the wild-type root length. After day 2,
when the difference in root length is measurable, the 14-3-
3l-1 root length begins to lag behind, and remain at
a slower and constant growth rate, while wild type, Res-mu,
and the 14-3-3l alleles accelerate in growth rate.
The decrease in root length of 14-3-3l-1 is not due to
altered nitrate reductase activity
The 14-3-3 proteins interact with nitrate reductase (NR), as
part of the NR inactivation process (Bachmann et al., 1996;
Moorhead et al., 1996). In fact, of the 14-3-3 isoforms
tested, 14-3-3t is the third most effective at inactivating
nitrate reductase (the 14-3-3l isoform was not tested in the
study) (Bachmann et al., 1996). Because of the 14-3-3
protein association with nitrate reductase inactivation, it
was possible that the loss of 14-3-3l protein resulted in
overactive nitrate reductase. Overactive nitrate reductase
protein, in combination with nitrate-rich media, could have
resulted in a reduced need for root elongation since the
roots had adequate nitrate levels available. In order to factor
out nitrate reductase activity as the cause of 14-3-3l-1
decreased root length, plants were grown on nitrate-free
media using ammonium-citrate as the only nitrogen source.
The 14-3-3l-1 root lengths were 40% of the wild type, when
grown on nitrate-free media for 14 d (see Supplementary Fig.
S1 at JXB online), indicating that increased nitrate reductase
activity was not the major factor for shorter 14-3-3l-1 roots.
Differential root length of 14-3-3l-1 can be partly
attributed to the photosensory pathway
The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants 14-3-3l-1, 14-3-3t-1,
and
14-3-3t-2
all
exhibit
reduced

growth
inhibition under narrow-bandwidth red light during early
development (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007), similar to PHYB and
PHYB-associated protein mutants (Neff and Chory, 1998;
Huq et al., 2000). In order to test if 14-3-3l-1 exhibits light-
dependent deviations in root length, as does phyB, the
14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were grown alongside
phyB and the wild type under three separate light intensities:
full-light (60–70 lmol m2 s1), low-light (5 lmol m2 s1),
and dark growth conditions. A CO mutant, co, was also
included in all of the altered light condition experiments
because CO is a binding partner of 14-3-3 proteins and
is
associated
with
14-3-3-mediated
red-light
signalling
(Mayﬁeld et al., 2007). Seeds were planted on vertical plates
and exposed to light for 1 h to promote germination, then
transferred to full-light, low-light, or dark chambers. Root
lengths were measured after 8 d (Fig. 2A, B). Under dark
conditions, 14-3-3t-1, 14-3-3t-2, co, and phyB roots were
similar in length to the wild-type roots. 14-3-3l-1 roots were
slightly shorter than wild-type roots when grown in dark
and low light conditions. 14-3-3l-1 roots were ;80% and
;68% of wild-type root length in darkness and low light,
respectively. By contrast, 14-3-3l-1 roots were ;25% of
wild-type root length when grown in full-light conditions.
As light intensity growth conditions decreased, 14-3-3l-1 and
Res-mu root lengths became more comparable (Fig. 2C).
Res-mu root lengths were comparable with the wild type in
all three light conditions.
14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutant roots develop
increased numbers of chloroplasts during early
development
Roots experiencing prolonged light exposure exhibit greening
resulting from chloroplast development (Whatley, 1983).
PHYB is a positive regulator of chloroplast development in
Arabidopsis roots (Usami et al., 2004). Due to similarities of
14-3-3l-1 and phyB in the inﬂuence on root length by light
intensity, the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were assayed
for root chloroplast development along with the wild type,
Res-mu, co, and phyB. Plants were grown on vertical agar
plates under constant light conditions for 5 d. Roots of the
5-d-old plants were viewed with a ﬂuorescent microscope.
The roots were illuminated with blue light (488 nm) and
viewed through a long pass ﬁlter in order to view the red
autoﬂuorescence of chlorophyll.
A large number of chloroplasts were visualized within
the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and
co (Fig. 3A). Wild-type and Res-mu roots developed
chloroplasts, but in smaller numbers compared with the 14-
3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co. The roots of phyB
did not develop any observable chloroplasts under white
light. The roots of 14-3-3l-1 had the most dramatic increase
in chloroplast number. The co, 14-3-3t-1, and 14-3-3t-2
roots had slightly fewer chloroplasts than 14-3-3l-1.
The red channel level within the frame of each photo-
graph was also quantiﬁed (Fig. 3B). Photo frames of equal
size, exposure, and colour adjustment were taken of 4–6
roots from each line. The red channel tonal levels of each
photo frame were quantiﬁed using the RGB Measure Plus
plug-in of the ImageJ software package. Quantiﬁcation of
the red light tonal levels showed that the average red tonal
level for the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co were
higher than the wild type or Res-mu. T-tests conﬁrmed that
red tonal levels of 14-3-3l-1, 14-3-3t-1, 14-3-3t-2, and co
root pictures were statistically higher than the wild-type
levels (a¼0.0000, 0.0067, 0.0127, and 0.0011, respectively).
The photo frames of phyB roots contained statistically
lower red tonal levels than the wild type, as conﬁrmed by
a t test (a¼0.0253).
The dramatic increase in chloroplasts in 14-3-3l-1 roots
was also examined with confocal microscopy. Wild-type
3064 | Mayﬁeld et al.

and 14-3-3l-1 plants were vertically grown for 5 d under full
light conditions (60–70 lmol m2 s1), and root sections
were observed to determine the distribution of chloroplasts
(Fig. 4). The DIC images illustrated that the roots were of
the same developmental age, with cells of comparable size, in
the wild-type and 14-3-3l-1 plants (Fig. 4A, D). Fluorescent
images of the wild type and 14-3-3l-1 showed that while the
plastid size is comparable for each plant, the quantity of
plastids in the 14-3-3l-1 roots is around 2-fold that of the
wild type (Fig. 4B, E).
Narrow-bandwidth red or blue light inﬂuence both root
length and the numbers of chloroplasts in the roots
Root lengths were also assayed from plants grown on
vertical agar plates for 8 d under narrow-bandwidth red
(25 lmol m2 s1) or blue (50 lmol m2 s1) light (Fig. 5).
The 14-3-3l-1 roots were ;65% or ;60% of the length of
wild-type roots in red or blue light conditions, respectively.
14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2 roots were similar in length to wild-
type roots when grown under blue light, but shorter when
grown under red light. The 14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2 roots
were ;83% and ;86% of the length of wild-type roots,
respectively. The differences in root lengths of red-light-grown

3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co after 5 d of growth. The 14-3-3
T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co, phyB, and the wild type
were grown on vertical agar plates for 5 d under constant light.
Roots were illuminated with a blue light and visualized through
a GFP long pass ﬁlter with a ﬂuorescent microscope (A). The roots
of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co contained more
chloroplasts, which autoﬂuoresce as a red colour. Pictures of roots
from each line were cropped to equal sizes and the red tonal levels
were measured with the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of the ImageJ
program (B). The red tonal levels were higher for 14-3-3l-1,
14-3-3t1, 14-3-3t-2 and co roots compared with the wild type.

with a signiﬁcant difference in root length compared with the wild

intensities. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co,
phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates in dark
(A) and low-light (B) conditions for 8 d and root lengths were
measured. The roots of 14-3-3l-1 were ;77% and ;68% of the
wild-type roots in dark and low-light conditions, respectively. Root
lengths of 14-3-3l-1 and Res-mu were compared as a % of
wild-type root lengths when grown in three conditions: full light,
low light, and dark (C). Res-mu roots were equal to wild-type root
lengths in all treatments. The roots of 14-3-3l-1 were more
comparable to wild-type lengths as the light conditions decreased
in intensity. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks

14-3-3 proteins regulate root and chloroplast development | 3065

14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2 were conﬁrmed to be statistically
different by t test (aa¼0.0003 and 0.0050, respectively).
Root chloroplast development can be inﬂuenced by
growth under different wavelengths of light (Usami et al.,
2004). When grown in dark or low light conditions, roots
from none of the lines studied developed observable
chloroplasts (data not shown). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion
mutants, co, phyB, Res-mu, and the wild type were also
grown under narrow-bandwidth red or blue light to test
whether

development differently among the lines. Plants were grown
for 5 d under red or blue light and then the roots were
assayed for chloroplasts (Fig. 6). As previously published
(Usami et al., 2004), blue light stimulated more root
chloroplast development than red light. Furthermore, blue
light stimulated more chloroplast development in the roots
than white light. The roots of blue-light-grown 14-3-3l-1
developed a higher number of chloroplasts than any of the
other lines (Fig. 6A). Quantiﬁcation of red tonal levels
conﬁrmed that 14-3-3l-1 roots contain higher red tonal
levels than both the wild type and Res-mu (Fig. 6B). The red

as conﬁrmed by t test (a¼0.0012 and 0.0323, respectively).
Out of the lines grown under red light, 14-3-3l-1 and co
were the only sets that developed noticeably visible chlor-
oplasts in the roots (Fig. 6C). The small number of
chloroplasts in the 14-3-3l-1 and co roots was not enough
to raise the red tonal level of either mutant to a signiﬁcant
difference from that of wild-type roots (Fig. 6D).
Discussion
This study characterizes several novel functions of 14-3-3
proteins in root growth and chloroplast development. The
14-3-3 l T-DNA insertion mutants exhibited altered root
lengths and chloroplast numbers in the roots. The pheno-
types exhibited by the 14-3-3 l T-DNA insertion mutants
could all be inﬂuenced by growth conditions altered in light
intensity or wavelength. The 14-3-3 t T-DNA insertion
mutants exhibited altered root lengths in red light and also
had altered numbers of chloroplasts in the roots. Most of
the root development phenotypes exhibited by these 14-3-3
T-DNA insertion mutants can be attributed to deﬁciencies
in the photosensory system.
The roots of 14-3-3l-1 were only ;25% as long as the
roots of the wild type after 8 d of growth under constant
light (Fig. 1B). However, the roots of 14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2
are the same length as the wild type after 8 d under constant
light. The 14-3-3 l protein is therefore an important factor
in root growth, while 14-3-3 t does not have an observable
effect on root length under constant white light.
The differences in root length in 14-3-3l-1 are inﬂuenced
by light intensity (Fig. 2). The root length of 14-3-3l-1 was
more comparable to wild-type roots when grown in the
dark, compared with plants grown in full-light conditions
(Fig. 2A). Under low-light conditions, the 14-3-3l-1 root
length percentage compared with the wild-type root length
was intermediate between the root length percentages under
full-light and dark conditions (Fig. 2B, C).
Along with reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under
narrow-bandwidth red light, phytochromes are implicated
in root elongation and gravitropic response (Correll et al.,
2003; Correll and Kiss, 2005). The PHYB mutant, phyB,
exhibits signiﬁcantly reduced root elongation rates com-
pared with the wild type when grown in light, but does not
exhibit this same reduced root elongation rate when grown
in the dark (Correll and Kiss, 2005), which was also
observed in this study (Figs 1, 2). The roots of 14-3-3l-1
were not the same length as wild-type roots in dark grown
conditions. Because the roots of 14-3-3l-1 were still shorter

than wild-type roots in dark conditions, the difference in
14-3-3l-1
root
length
cannot
be
solely
attributed
to
deﬁciencies in light signalling. Future studies will identify
additional light-inﬂuenced and other developmental differ-
ences in 14-3-3l-1 roots.
Further phenotypic similarity between the 14-3-3 T-DNA
insertion mutants and phyB was noticeable under narrow-
bandwidth red light conditions (Fig. 5). The roots of phyB
grown under red light grow similarly to when they are
grown in dark conditions (Correll and Kiss, 2005) as also
seen in Figs 2 and 5. This similarity in root lengths under
red light and dark conditions was also true for the 14-3-3
T-DNA insertion mutants. The root lengths of 14-3-3l-1
were ;8 mm after 8 d of growth in both red light and dark
conditions. The root lengths of 14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2 were
;10 mm after 8 d of growth in both red light and dark
conditions. Further similarity to phyB, the root lengths of
14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2 were comparable with the wild type
when grown in dark conditions, but shorter when grown
under narrow-bandwidth red light.
The
14-3-3
T-DNA
insertion
mutants
also
exhibit
reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition under red light in
the ﬁrst 4 d of growth (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007). 14-3-3t-1 and
14-3-3t-2 grown under narrow bandwidth red light also
exhibit a more vertical directional growth habit than the
wild type (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007), similar to phyB (Liscum
and Hangarter, 1993; Poppe et al., 1996; Robson and
Smith, 1996).
Under blue light, 14-3-3t-1 and 14-3-3t-2 root lengths were
comparable with wild-type, but 14-3-3l-1 still exhibited
shorter roots (Fig. 5). Wild-type root lengths were ;36%
longer when grown under blue light compared with dark
conditions. 14-3-3l-1 root lengths were ;17% longer when
grown under blue light in comparison to dark conditions.
The difference in 14-3-3l-1 root length when grown in the
dark compared with blue light was less distinct than
comparing the difference in root length of light- and dark-
grown 14-3-3l-1, indicating that 14-3-3l-1 is slightly deﬁcient
in blue light signalling, a phenotype that is similar, but not as
strong as in cry1 mutants (Canamero et al., 2006).
Hypocotyl elongation inhibition is similar for 14-3-3l-1
and wild-type plants grown under narrow bandwidth blue
light (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007). Although 14-3-3 l was not found
to be associated with blue light signalling in the hypocotyl
during early development, these root length data indicate that
14-3-3 l is associated with blue light signalling in the roots
during early development. The association of 14-3-3 proteins
with blue light has also been seen in broad bean, where the
blue light photoreceptor, PHOT1, was identiﬁed as a client
protein of 14-3-3s (Kinoshita et al., 2003).
The roots of 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co
exhibit increased chloroplast numbers, or greening, after 5 d
of growth on vertical agar plates, while phyB roots exhibit
decreased chloroplast numbers (Fig. 3). The development of
chloroplasts in the roots can be inﬂuenced by both light
intensity and different wavelengths of light. Dark-grown
plants do not develop enough chloroplasts for detectable
levels of root greening, while higher numbers of chloro-
plasts are developed in the roots of plants grown under blue
light than plants grown under red light (Usami et al., 2004).
Low-light-grown plants of all lines studied also did not
develop enough chloroplasts for visualization in the roots,
indicating that a threshold level of light is required for
chloroplast development in the roots.
Root greening under red light conditions is primarily
induced by PHYB signalling, whereas, under blue light
conditions, root greening is mainly induced by CRY1 and
CRY2 signalling (Usami et al., 2004). However, phyAphyB
mutants are deﬁcient in blue-light-induced chloroplast de-
velopment, indicating that phytochromes are also important
for blue light induced chloroplast development in the roots
(Usami et al., 2004). Under blue light, 14-3-3l-1 exhibited
a quantiﬁable increase in root greening (Fig. 6B), indicating
that 14-3-3 l regulation of chloroplast development in the
roots is partly associated with blue light signalling. Differ-
ences seen in both root length and greening under blue light
will be evaluated in future studies, especially in the potential
for 14-3-3 association with CRY1 and its role in root length
and greening (Usami et al., 2004; Canamero et al., 2006).
The increased chloroplast numbers in the roots of the
14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and co indicated that
14-3-3 proteins and CO are negative regulators of chloro-
plast development in the roots. No quantiﬁable difference
in root greening was detected in the roots of any of the
lines grown under red light (Fig. 6D), although 14-3-3l-1
and co were the only lines to develop high enough numbers
of chloroplasts to be visualized with a ﬂuorescent micro-
scope (Fig. 6C). Additional work is necessary to further
characterize 14-3-3 l or CO as co-regulators of chloroplast

14-3-3 proteins regulate root and chloroplast development | 3067

development in the roots via red-light signalling. In fact,
this is the ﬁrst report implicating CO with root development,
however, CONSTANS-LIKE3 (COL3) is associated with
root development (Datta et al., 2006).
Although PHYB has not been identiﬁed as a protein
binding partner of 14-3-3 proteins, phytochromes are
regulated by phosphorylation, and the association of PHYB
with several phosphorylation events presents many situa-
tions of possible 14-3-3 protein involvement (Kim et al.,
2004). In addition, PHYB and PHYA induce phosphoryla-
tion of such proteins as PKS1 and PIF3 (Fankhauser et al.,
1999; Al-Sady et al., 2006).
This study presents novel roles of 14-3-3 proteins in root
and chloroplast development, as well as new roles of CO in
chloroplast development. Transcription levels of CO are
increased in early development upon irradiance of 4-d-old
dark-grown
seedlings
with
a
far-red
light
treatment
(Tepperman et al., 2001), but a function for CO in early
development has not been deﬁned. In fact, the increase in
chloroplast development in roots is the ﬁrst reported
phenotype for co in early development. The activity of CO
in chloroplast development may only be as a component of
the activity of CO and the COL proteins.
The
present
reverse-genetic
study
establishes
novel,
isoform-speciﬁc roles of 14-3-3 proteins in Arabidopsis root
and chloroplast development. 14-3-3 proteins are increas-
ingly recognized as a major node in the plant interactome,
an interaction node that includes CO and other signalling
molecules related to light responses (AIMC, 2011). Further,
the roles of 14-3-3 proteins in root and chloroplast devel-
opment are controlled by light intensity or wavelength.
14-3-3
TDNA
insertion
mutants
also
exhibit
reduced
hypocotyl elongation and time to ﬂowering, compared with
the wild type (Mayﬁeld et al., 2007). Both the hypocotyl
elongation and ﬂowering timing phenotypes are, in part,
due to 14-3-3 binding/inﬂuence of CO (Mayﬁeld et al.,
2007). The study presented here also characterizes CO as
a potential factor in root chloroplast development of
Arabidopsis during early development. Further work will be
necessary to understand the mechanism of 14-3-3 control of
both root and chloroplast development and how the
association of 14-3-3 proteins and CO factors into these
processes.
Fig. 6. Red and blue light inﬂuence the numbers of chloroplasts in
the roots. The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants, Res-mu, co,
phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates for
5 d under constant red or blue light. Roots were illuminated with
a blue light and visualized through a GFP long pass ﬁlter with
a ﬂuorescent microscope (A, C). All of the lines developed
increased numbers of chloroplasts when grown under blue light
compared with white light, but 14-3-3l-1 roots contained higher
numbers of chloroplasts than the other lines (A). When grown
under red light, the roots of 14-3-3l-1 and co were the only lines
that developed high enough numbers of chloroplasts to be
visualized with a ﬂuorescent microscope (C). Pictures of roots from
each line were cropped to equal sizes and the red tonal levels
were measured with the RGB Measure Plus plug-in of the ImageJ
program (B, D). When grown under blue light, the red tonal levels
were higher for only 14-3-3l-1 roots compared with the wild type
(B). When grown under red light, the red tonal levels were equal for
all lines measured (D). Although chloroplasts could only be
visualized for 14-3-3l-1 and co roots, the differences in tonal
levels were not enough to be detected by the RGB Measure Plus
program. Error bars represent standard error and asterices
indicate lines with a signiﬁcant difference in root length compared
with the wild type using a t test (B, D).
