Abstract
It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph,
to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of ‘‘toxic
lymph’’ following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we
utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with
mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase perme-
ability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with
doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations,
morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII+ immune
cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed signiﬁcantly following burn
injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (*1.5-fold) and induced breaks
in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel,
whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The
size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells
already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These ﬁndings suggest that
factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during
traumatic injury can inﬂuence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.

Introduction
T
he function of the lymphatic system is to maintain
ﬂuid and macromolecular homeostasis, regulate the
trafﬁcking of antigens and immune cells, and condition the
immune response.1–3 When these functions are interrupted,
the result is often edema accompanied by inﬂammation and
disruption of the immune response in the tissue served by
those lymphatics. Examples of this include lymphedema
and its association with cellulitis or lymphangiectasia with
accompanying disturbances in gut immune responses.4–9
Because the lymphatic system is a regulator of ﬂuid phys-
iological homeostasis and also immunological regulation,
local disturbances in lymphatic function may have far-
reaching systemic effects.10–12
Burn injuries are a common traumatic injury and carry a
substantial morbidity and mortality risk. According to the
American Burn Association, almost 500,000 Americans
sustained signiﬁcant burns in 2016.13–15 The mortality rate
following burn (including all forms of burn) is 3.3%, whereas
those burned by ﬁre or ﬂames have a higher mortality rate of
5.8%.14,15 The risk of death associated with burn increases

with the size of the burn sustained (% of surface area).16 The
average cost of hospital stay for burn victims in 2016 was
over $250,000.17–19 Burns can lead to substantial health
consequences, including scarring, systemic inﬂammatory
response syndrome, multiple organ failure, and long-term
fatigue.20–22 The association of some of these sequelae with
the immune system activation and dysregulation indicates
that an exploration of the response of immune mediators
warrants further exploration.
Traumatic injuries, especially burn, are complex chains of
pathologies and physiologic responses.23–25 These patholo-
gies often result in increases in circulating cytokines, che-
mokines, and adipokines, which cause immune activation
and increased vascular permeability.26–28 Additionally, most
major trauma is accompanied by increased intestinal per-
meability and translocation of intestinal contents, including
constituents of the microbiota, and associated development
of cytotoxic lymph.29,30 Cytotoxic lymph is so named be-
cause of its ability to cause dysfunction in a number of dif-
ferent cell types, including cardiomyocytes, macrophages,
and endothelial cells.12,31–37
Vascular endothelial dysfunction, and by extension vas-
cular dysfunction, is a major concern after trauma and results
in massively increased vascular permeability. This perme-
ability can lead to reduced blood pressure, decreased per-
fusion, and massive edema, all of which have detrimental
effects at sites distant from the injury. Historically, studies
have focused on blood vasculature not the lymphatic vascu-
lature in traumatic injury. More recently there have been
studies examining the effect of trauma on lymphatic function.
However, the techniques used could only demonstrate dif-
ferential regulation of lymphatic ﬂow after different forms of
trauma.38–40 During severe burn injuries, lymph ﬂow is in-
creased dramatically, likely due to increased blood vessel
leakage and increased interstitial pressures, rapidly causing
distal pathologies after insult.40,41
The role of lymph as a major contributor to global pathol-
ogies after trauma has been supported by animal studies, pri-
marily in models of burn injury and hemorrhagic shock. While
the initiating injury for these forms of trauma is vastly different,
the resulting pathologies are very similar.23,29,40,42,43 Both
burns and hemorrhage are associated with increased intestinal
epithelial permeability and the development of cytotoxic
lymph.27,43–45 However, it is unclear what processes are me-
diating these effects. The ﬁrst organs to be affected after burn
injury and hemorrhagic shock are the heart and the lungs,
which are the ﬁrst organs to receive lymph returned to the great
veins in the upper chest.29 In hemorrhagic shock, ligation of
major lymphatic conduit vessels, the cisterna chyli and the
thoracic duct, reduced or eliminated heart and lung injury,
conﬁrming the involvement of lymph in these processes.29,31,46
Our previous ﬁndings show that lymphatic vessels have a
unique and larger immunological ﬁngerprint compared with
either arteries or veins.47 This is due to the association of cells
of the innate immune system lying in close proximity to and
in some cases integrated into the lymphatic vessel wall. One
particular population, MHCII+ CD11c- cells, is extremely
responsive to inﬂammatory stimuli. In a model of intestinal
inﬂammation, we have shown that this population begins to
increase around the lymphatic vessels in as little as 1 hour
after insult.48 More importantly, when this cell population
increases, there is an immediate shift in the environment
surrounding the lymphatic vessel, with increased expression
of proinﬂammatory cytokines,48 which would affect lymph
composition.4,10,49–51 We hypothesize that burn injury in-
duces leakage of lymph from lymphatic vessels and that this
will cause an increase in the number of MHCII+ immune cells
to trafﬁc to the perilymphatic space.
Materials and Methods
Animal care and use
All animal procedures followed NIH guidelines for the
care and use of laboratory animals as well as the rules of the
Scott and White and Texas A&M Institutional Care and Use
Committees. Animals used in this study were also used in a
separate study to examine blood vascular permeability in
burn injury and hemorrhagic shock.
Induction of burn
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g) were anesthetized
by intraperitoneal injection of Urethane (1.25 g/kg) and pre-
pared for surgery by removing the hair from the abdomen,
inner thigh of the right rear leg, and throat. Incisions at the
throat and thigh were made to access the jugular vein and
femoral artery and these vessels were cannulated and secured
in place by 6–0 silk sutures. All bleeding were arrested by
electrocauterization. Animals were pretreated 1 hour before
induction of burn with either 30 mg/kg doxycycline or sterile
saline (in 1 mL). Sterile saline was infused through the jug-
ular vein to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) during
the course of the experiment and blood was drawn and MAP
was measured from the femoral artery.
Animals were placed into an adjustable ﬂoating shield that
exposed 30% of the surface area of the animal and were exposed
to 100C water for 10 seconds resulting in third-degree equiv-
alent burn on 30% of the body. Immediately after inducing burn
injury the mesentery of the animal was exposed through a
midline laparotomy and a loop of intestine was ﬁxed to a
warmed dissection board. The animals were allowed to equili-
brate on the dissection board for 30 minutes before the start of
the procedure. Blood pressure was maintained at 80 mmHg by
perfusion of sterile saline and monitored for 1 hour. After
1 hour, blood was drawn from the animal to exsanguinate and
for serum. The small intestine and mesentery were pinned out
into Sylgard 184-coated dishes and ﬁxed in 4% paraformal-
dehyde for 2 hours and then the mesentery was trimmed away
from the gut wall and prepared for immunohistochemistry.
Whole-mount immunohistochemistry/quantiﬁcation
of immune cells
The mesenteric tissue harvested from the burn protocols
was excised and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
three times for 5 minutes each after ﬁxation and placed into
PBS with 0.01 Triton X-100 for 1 hour to permeabilize the
tissue. After permeabilization, the tissue was placed in 5%
normal goat serum in PBS blocking solution for2 hours. The
tissue was then incubated overnight at 4C in a 1:200 dilution
of anti-MHCII antibody (SantaCruz 10.3-6) or mouse IgG
control in ProHistoª Amplifying Antibody Dilution Buffer.
The tissue was washed three times using ProHisto wash
buffer for 10 minutes and then secondary antibody (anti-
mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluorª 488) was added at 1:200 dilution

in ProHisto Amplifying Antibody Dilution Buffer for 2 hours
at room temperature in a light-proof container. The tissue was
then washed following the same procedure for the primary
antibody and the tissue was mounted by being sandwiched
between 24 · 60 mm number 1 coverslips in ProLong Goldª
Antifade Reagent.
The whole-mount tissue was imaged using a Leica AOBS
PS2 confocal microscope with a 40 · water immersion lens
with the airy disk set to 1 using 0.33um step size. Laser power
was set to 50% and the photo multiplier tube was adjusted to
yield *10% saturated pixels at the most intense ﬂuorescence
per stack. Presence of a lymphatic vessel was conﬁrmed by
observation of bulbous valve regions by transmitted light and
lack of red blood cells in the lumen. After image acquisition
the image stacks were processed using ImageJ software
(NIH), where they were despeckled, smoothed, and merged
into an average projection. The resulting projections were all
then adjusted for brightness and contrast to the same levels.
Blinded scorers then counted the number of MHCII+ cells
that were directly interacting with the vessel (deﬁned by cells
breaching the border of the vessel in the stack). ImageJ was
used to measure area (XYX), circularity (how closely a shape
matches a circular ellipse), and aspect ratio (the ratio of the
longest span of the shape versus the longest perpendicular
measurement) of the cells interfacing with the vessels.
Permeability studies
Primary rat lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were iso-
lated from mesenteric lymphatics and cultured as previously
described.52 The LECs were grown to visual conﬂuence in
24-well transwell inserts (PTFE; 0.4 lm pore size, Corning)
coated with 2% porcine gelatin. Seventy-two hours after visual
conﬂuence, cells were placed into DMEM without Phenol Red
with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and a mix of
penicillin/streptomycin (starvation media) for 2 hours (200lL
in the upper chamber and 600 lL in the lower chamber). After
starvation, the 100 lL of serum isolated from sham-operated
animals, burn animals, or doxycycline-treated burn animals
was added to the upper (luminal) chamber of the transwell. The
wells were allowed to incubate with the serum for 1 hour then
10lL of 10mg/mL ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum
albumin (FITC-BSA) was added to the upper chamber and
allowed to incubate an additional 1 hour. At the end of the
incubation, 10lL of the medium was removed from the lower
(abluminal) chamber and mixed with 90lL of Milli-Q water
and placed in a black-walled microplate. The plates were then
read on a ﬂuorescence-capable microplate reader with 488/
504 nm excitation/emission pair.
Lymphatic endothelial VE-cadherin staining
Rat mesenteric LEC as used for the permeability studies
were grown on 12 mm glass coverslips in 24-well culture
dishes until conﬂuent. The culture medium was removed and
replaced with 400 lL of starvation medium as described for
the permeability assays 2 hours before treatment. Two hun-
dred microliters of serum from sham, doxycycline-treated
sham, burn, or doxycycline-treated burn was added to the
wells and allowed to incubate for 2 hours. At the end of
treatment, the medium was removed from the wells and the
cells washed three times with PBS before ﬁxation in 2%
paraformaldehyde at 4C for 2 hours. Cells were then washed
with PBS three times and blocked with 5% normal goat
serum in PBS for 2 hours. The cells were then incubated in
primary antibody (mouse anti-VE-cadherin; Santa Cruz
H-72) at 1:200 dilution overnight at 4C in 0.5% goat serum/
0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were washed three
times in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100. Secondary
antibody (goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488; Life Technolo-
gies) was added to the cells at a 1:500 dilution in PBS and
allowed to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells
were washed in PBS 3 times and the coverslips were removed
from the 24-well plates and mounted on slides using ProLong
Gold without DAPI. Slides were imaged using an Olympus
wide-ﬁeld BX-12 microscope. Breaks in VE-cadherin stain-
ing per 40 · ﬁeld of view were quantiﬁed.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using GraphPad InStatª software
using ANOVA tests and Student’s t-test depending upon the
number of variables. Where appropriate, Dunnett’s post-test
was performed to compare all data to the control. Sample sizes
were determined by power analysis assuming a 20% change in
values of cell number and a 10% deviation around the mean.
Results
We analyzed the number of MHCII+ cells in the mesentery
and their association with the lymphatic vessels in that tissue
(Fig. 1a, b). Burn injury signiﬁcantly increased the number of
MHCII+ cells that interacted with the lymphatic vessels
compared with sham control (1.50– 0.17-fold) (Fig. 1c). The
number of cells that did not interface with the vessel in burn
injury also signiﬁcantly increased (2.29– 0.49-fold) (Fig. 1d).
The size (area) of MHCII+ cells associated with the lymphatic
vessels changed dramatically after burn injury, increasing
2.59– 0.32-fold (Fig. 2c). Cells also increased their perimeter
after burn relative to sham (Fig. 2d); however, the changes in
area and perimeter were not proportional suggesting the cells
changed their shape in addition to size (Fig. 2e). We conﬁrmed
there was an elongation of the MHCII+ cells along the axis of
the vessel in burn injury as detected by an increase in aspect
ratio (ratio of the longest axis to shortest axis) (Fig. 2f).
LEC monolayer permeability to FITC-BSA increased
signiﬁcantly in response to burn injury serum compared with
sham serum (1.52 – 0.041-fold) (Fig. 3). Additionally, the
number of gaps that formed between LECs treated with se-
rum from burn animals was higher than that from sham or
either doxycycline-treated groups (Fig. 4).
Doxycycline treatment reduced the accumulation of
MHCII+ immune cells on and near the mesenteric lymphatic
vessel wall after burn injury to control levels (Fig. 5a). Ad-
ditionally, doxycycline reduced the number of immune cells
in the periphery of the mesenteric tissue to levels between
control and burn levels (1.47 – 0.23-fold increase over con-
trol), but not signiﬁcantly different from either control (sham)
or burn alone (Fig. 5b). Despite the reduction in the number
of cells, the morphology of the cells changed, with cells in-
creasing in size to a greater extent than in untreated burn
(3.57 – 0.27 vs. 2.59.64 – 0.32-fold) (Fig. 5d). In addition to
reducing the accumulation of immune cells on and around the
lymphatic vessels, doxycycline completely inhibited the
ability of burn serum to induce LEC monolayer permeability,
but had no effect on sham serum (Fig. 3).

Discussion
Burns are complex injuries that require extensive treatment
for the primary insult as well as the secondary global pathol-
ogies, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome.29 Current evidence from animal
models suggests that there is a gut/mesenteric lymph axis that
is imbalanced during these injuries caused by increased in-
testinal epithelial injury resulting in generation of toxic
lymph.26,32,43,44 This toxic lymph is the driving force of sec-
ondary injury in distal tissues following burns in experimental
models and diverting lymph ﬂow so that it does not return to
the blood circulation blocking distal injury.26,31,42,43
There is still debate as to what causes lymph from the gut to
be toxic after traumatic injury. However, many studies implicate
gut tissue-derived cytokines, other immunoactive substances
(chemokines, adipokines, TLR agonists etc.), and the immune
cells residing in those tissues, but there has not been an exten-
sive characterization of those populations to date.26,30,42,44 Our
recent ﬁndings that there is a resident mixed population of im-
mune cells in, on, and surrounding lymphatic vessels lead us to
examine the numbers of a representative population of those
immune cells along the mesenteric lymphatic vessels after burn
injury and if it could be regulated pharmacologically (Fig 6).47
Our previous work indicates that the population of MHCII+
immune cells rapidly increases in number along the lymphatic
vessel wall following injury. We have previously used this cell
population as an indicator of immune cell attraction and
accumulation on lymphatic vessels in a number of different
pathologies, including ageing, metabolic syndrome, and in-
ﬂammatory bowel disease. This subtype of immune cell is
highly MHCII+, CD74+, and in the rat is CD11c-, CD206–
(proportions can change depending upon tissue state), CD86–,
CD83–, CD68+, and CCR6– (Supplementary Fig. S1; Sup-
plementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/
lrb). This suggests that we are looking at a relatively diverse set
of populations capable of antigen presentation or a spectrum of
a single population of antigen-presenting cells.
Given that these cells are highly MHCII+, we assume that
they are professional antigen-presenting cells that are unique in
that they trafﬁc to the lymphatic vessel wall as opposed to
entering the initial lymphatics and then moving to the lymph
node. Our study demonstrates that these cells can take up and
process antigen carried in the lymph stream (Supplementary
Fig. S2). This suggests that they may be able to present antigen
and activate immune responses in the peripheral tissues.
However, these studies have not demonstrated which cell type
these lymphatic vessel wall-trafﬁcking antigen-presenting cells
interact with. In this pathology, these MHCII+ cells could likely
be presenting antigen and activation signals to cells such as
tissue-resident T cells (such as TH-17 and cd T-cells) that have
been shown to play a major role in the pathology of burn.53 If

this were the case, this would represent a major change in the
paradigm of antigen trafﬁcking and immune activation.
After burn injury, the number of MHCII+ cells along the
lymphatic vessels increased dramatically in a manner similar
to but even more profound than what we have observed in our
models of intestinal inﬂammation induced by TNBS. In our
previous work, we observed that lymphatic dysfunction cor-
relates to the density of immune cells in close proximity to the
outside of lymphatic vessels on a near 1:1 negative ratio.48
Recent ﬁndings have shown that lymphatic contractile func-
tion (not transport) as measured ex vivo is compromised after
burn injury and in the light of this data and our previous studies
suggest that this impaired contractile function may be caused
by the accumulation of immune cells surrounding the vessels
and altering the local environment.40,48 There was also an in-
crease in the number of MHCII+ immune cells in the periphery
of the mesenteric tissue that was proportionally greater than
the increase along the lymphatic vessels. Thus, we assume that
there is some attractive signal carried in lymph that causes cells
to home to the external wall of the lymphatic vessels after
exiting the blood vasculature during inﬂammation and injury
and that the number of cells leaving the blood vasculature
increases at a greater rate than the rate of migration to the
lymphatic vessels and possibly leaving the tissue.
The exact signal that induces the migration of cells to the
lymphatic vessels is currently not known, and we hypothesize
that it is carried in the lymph itself. Given our previous data in a
model of inﬂammatory bowel disease, we may presume that it is
likely a chemokine signal such as granulocyte/monocyte-colony
stimulatingfactor(GM-CSF)releasedbyactivatedimmunecells
in the gut and carried in the lymph.48 However, it cannot be
assumed that chemokines such as GM-CSF are the only likely

chemoattractants released from the lymph as there are likely
many other signals also carried in the lymph stream. We assume
that the signal that recruits these cells is carried in the lymph
becauseof evidence fromour study.Theﬁrstpiece ofevidenceis
that serum from burn animals induces lymphatic endothelial
permeability to increase (Fig. 3) and there is concomitant evi-
dencethatthereisdisruptionofthecontinuityofendothelialcell–
cell junctions in the LECs in vitro in response to burn serum
(Fig. 4). Disruption of lymphatic endothelial junctional compo-
nents is not surprising and is similar to ﬁndings in blood vascular
endothelial cells.54,55 Second, doxycycline (an inhibitor of ma-
trix metalloproteinases) inhibits the increase in lymphatic en-
dothelial permeability and prevents the disruption of lymphatic
endothelial junction stability. Third, doxycycline completely
inhibits the accumulation of immune cells on the lymphatic
vesselsduringburn,butonlypartiallyblockstheaccumulationof
cells in the periphery of the mesentery as permeability plays a
partial role in the escape of immune cells from the blood vas-
culature. Fourth, cells already directly in contact with the lym-
phatic vessels, therefore capable of sampling lymph, change
their morphology despite doxycycline treatment. Taken

together, this is strong evidence that the chemoattractive force
for these cells to migrate to the lymphatic vessels primarily
originates in the lymph and not produced by cells that are part
of or associated with the vessels, although it cannot be dis-
counted that they may play a small role.
The change in the morphology of the perilymphatic MHCII+
cells in burn injury was dramatic, with cells becoming larger,
more elongated, and oriented along the vessels, which are signs
of macrophage activation.56,57 Activation of these cells along the
vessels may result in the further generation and addition to the
lymph of inﬂammatory mediators that are problematic in the
treatment of burn. In our previous studies, we found that the
genes for the inﬂammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor-a
and inducible nitrous oxide synthase, were upregulated along the
vessels dueto migration of theimmune cells to theperilymphatic
space. Dueto the proximityof the cellsto the lymphaticvessels it
is highly likely that the cellular products of these cells are carried
immediately into the lymph stream with little dilution by other
cellular products (such as lymph generated at initial lymphatics).
The morphology of the cells on the mesenteric lymphatic vessels
following doxycycline treatment during burn also changes, but
in different ways that in burn alone. The cells present after
FIG. 6.
Overview of the theorized changes that occur around lymphatic vessels during burn injury. As a quiescent state
changes to an inﬂamed state due to burn injury, lymphatic permeability increases allowing lymph contents escape the vessel
to form a chemoattractive gradient that guides cells that escape from nearby blood vessels to the lymphatic vessel.

doxycycline-treated burn increase in size to a greater degree than
that of the burn alone group, while the aspect ratio decreased to
levels below control. These size changes suggest that, despite the
reduced number of cells being attracted to the vessels, the im-
mune cells that are present are being activated. Thus, these cells
are likely sampling lymph ‘‘normally,’’ like we have observed in
our antigen-trafﬁcking studies (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
decreased aspect ratio of the cells is difﬁcult to interpret, given
that an increased score would suggest a closer association with
the vessel axis, while a reduced score suggests a nonspeciﬁc
enlargement.Thereducedscorewefoundindoxycycline-treated
burn cells may be evidence that these local lymphatic-associated
immune cells can be activatedin response to anaberrantsignal in
lymph, but need a secondary signal which may come from out-
side the vessel to increase their association with the vessel. This
signal could originate from another immune cell population that
would normally arrive after injury.
It is widely accepted that toxic lymph develops in models of
trauma and induces dysfunction in a number of organs and cell
types. We have found that during burn injury there is increased
potential for lymphatic leakage and this leakage is associated
with increased recruitment of MHCII+ cells along the mes-
enteric lymphatic vessels, and these cells alter their morphol-
ogy suggesting inﬂammatory activation. We know from our
previous work that cells much like these express high levels of
inﬂammatory mediators and given their proximity to the
lymphatic vessels, these cells likely inﬂuence the makeup of
the lymph and the function of the lymphatic vessels during
injury. This inﬂuence may be a factor in the development of
toxic lymph after trauma that has not been studied.
