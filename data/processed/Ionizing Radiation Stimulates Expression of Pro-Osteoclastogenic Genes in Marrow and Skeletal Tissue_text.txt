Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within
metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deﬁcits. To better understand mechanisms
involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the inﬂuence of total body irradiation on ex-
pression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inﬂammatory bone
disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or
heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy
(typical total dose is ‡ 10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and
mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h)
and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine,
receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl
expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression
induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic
cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-
alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-
resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, strongly correlated
with expression levels of Nfatc1, Csf1, Tnf, and Rankl. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone
resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week).
We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations
of speciﬁc genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select
cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and pro-
gressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.
Introduction
D
uring a spaceﬂight beyond the Earth’s protective
magnetosphere, astronauts are exposed to a complex
mixture of ionizing radiation (Durante and Cucinotta 2011),
including low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and
protons, as well as more damaging high-LET radiation.
Exposure to space radiation is characterized by relatively
low doses ( £ 2 Gy) of ion species due to solar particle events
(Shurshakov and others 1999; Parsons and Townsend 2000)
or galactic cosmic rays (Zeitlin and others 2013; Hassler and
others 2014). Simulated space radiation at these doses
causes a rapid net decline in cancellous bone volume to total
volume as well as a decrement relative to age-matched
controls (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010).
The bone loss is associated with increased osteoclast num-
bers and resorbing surfaces of osteoclasts lining trabeculae
(Hamilton and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010; Kondo
and others 2010; Willey and others 2010; Yumoto and
others 2010; Lloyd and others 2012). Doses in the range of

1–2 Gy also are relevant to radiotherapy; total therapeutic
doses can vary, but total body doses of 10–15 Gy typically
are fractionated into single doses of *2 Gy, which ulti-
mately can lead to increased fracture incidence (Baxter and
others 2005). Exposure to radiation, particularly high-LET
particles, has the potential to exacerbate the deleterious ef-
fects of musculoskeletal disuse, which occurs during pro-
longed bed rest or spaceﬂight (LeBlanc and others 2000;
Lang and others 2004, 2006; Keyak and others 2009; Al-
wood and others 2010; Yumoto and others 2010).
Previous work shows that radiation exposure elicits a
transient ( < 2 weeks) pro-resorptive state in cancellous tis-
sue, resulting in net bone loss compared with basal (time of
radiation) and age-matched controls (Kondo and others
2010; Willey and others 2010; Alwood and others 2012).
Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are thought to cause the rapid
(Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010; Turner
and others 2013) cancellous strut losses following simulated
space irradiation, leading to loss of microarchitectural in-
tegrity (Alwood and others 2010). Radiation exposure
transiently and markedly increases the numbers of osteo-
clasts and the extent of cancellous surfaces covered by os-
teoclasts. However, the role that receptor activator of nuclear
factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), the principal osteoclasto-
genic cytokine, plays in concert with other pro-osteoclastic
inﬂammatory cytokines (Kim and others 2006; Takayanagi
2007; Boyce and Xing 2008) and oxidative stress is not fully
understood with respect to the cancellous bone loss fol-
lowing radiation exposure (Kondo and others 2009).
Total body irradiation ( £ 2 Gy) causes time-dependent
changes in the bone formation by osteoblasts, although these
changes do not account for the early and rapid decrement in
bone mass observed following exposure to total body irra-
diation within this dose range. Within 3 days of exposure to
radiation, the net bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR/
BS) is unaffected (Kondo and others 2010). Although ra-
diation does affect osteoblast function within the ﬁrst week
of exposure, as indicated by an observed increase in mineral
apposition rate (MAR), a concomitant reduction in the
mineralizing surface yields no net change in the bone for-
mation rate (Kondo and others 2010). Similarly, Willey and
others (2010) also report increased MAR within the ﬁrst
week after exposure, but subsequently BFR/BS declines by
2 and 3 weeks after exposure to 2 Gy X-ray, while Turner and
others reported transient increased bone formation even after
very high doses of radiation (6Gy). Therefore, radiation-in-
duced changes in bone formation are more likely to con-
tribute to later remodeling deﬁcits rather than acute bone loss.
To better understand net bone loss in the acute response to
radiation exposure, we examined the temporal expression
within both marrow and mineralized tissue of Rankl and
select pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines implicated in various
models of inﬂammatory bone loss (Braun and Schett 2012)
following exposure to low- or high-LET species of radiation.
Furthermore, we investigated the temporal expression of a
key antioxidant transcription factor (nuclear factor, erythroid-
derived 2,-like 2, Nfe2l2), which is responsible for mounting
a rapid defense against oxidative challenges (Kobayashi and
Yamamoto 2005) and is known to play a role in dampening
osteoclastogenesis (Hyeon and others 2013).
We hypothesized that radiation exposure induces ex-
pression of pro-osteoclastogenic, pro-inﬂammatory, and an-
tioxidant genes within both marrow and mineralized tissue
compartments and increases markers of bone resorption.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that these changes are likely to
contribute to later cancellous bone loss. This work shows an
acute and time-dependent elevation of Rankl, monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp1), and tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (Tnf) gene expression in the marrow or in skeletal
compartments due to low- or high-LET irradiation. These
molecular changes precede ( < 3 days) the manifestation of
bone loss (3–7 days) following iron irradiation at a dose
relevant to fractionated radiotherapy or space missions.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Post-pubescent (16 weeks – 4 days at time of irradiation),
male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were individ-
ually housed and provided food (LabDiet 5001) and water
ad libitum, as described elsewhere (Yumoto and others
2010). Animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation or an-
esthetized with isoﬂurane, followed by blood draw through
cardiac puncture. The Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees for NASA Ames Research Center and Broo-
khaven National Laboratory approved all procedures.
Experiment design and radiation exposure
Experiments were conducted to determine the temporal
changes in the levels of key genes and circulating proteins
related to bone resorption in the latency period before the
onset of overt structural loss. To evaluate heavy-ion effects,
conscious mice were exposed to high-LET iron ions (56Fe,
600 MeV/ion, 5cGy or 2 Gy, at a rate of 5 or 0.50–1.10 Gy/
min, respectively) at the NASA Space Radiation Labora-
tory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, or were sham irra-
diated as previously described (n = 5–8/group). Mice were
euthanized and tissues harvested at baseline (ie, time of ir-
radiation) or 3 or 7 days after exposure. To evaluate gamma
radiation effects, conscious mice were irradiated with low-
LET 137Cs gamma rays [2 Gy, 0.80 Gy/min, as described in
detail in Kondo and others (2010)] or were sham irradiated.
Euthanasia and tissue harvest took place 4 h or 1 day ( – 2 h),
3 days, or 7 days after exposure (n = 5–7/group).
Bone microarchitecture
Bone volume and microarchitecture of the proximal tibial
metaphysis were quantiﬁed by microcomputed tomography
(6.8 mm pixel size, 3,500 ms integration time, 50 kV, Sky-
scan 1174; Bruker microCT) similar to Kondo and others
(2009). Brieﬂy, a 1.0-mm thick region located 0.24 mm
distal to the proximal growth plate of the tibia was selected
and semiautonomously contoured to include cancellous
tissue. To assess bone loss, the bone volume to total volume
fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm),
trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation
(Tb.Sp, mm) were calculated and reported following con-
ventional guidelines (Bouxsein and others 2010).
qRT-PCR for gene expression within marrow
and skeletal tissue
Femora and tibiae were dissected, cleaned of soft tissues,
ﬂushed of bone marrow with phosphate-buffered saline,

and stored in RNALater (Qiagen, Inc.) at - 80C. Bone
marrow cells were lysed and preserved with guanidine-
thiocyanate-containing RLT buffer (Qiagen, Inc.) with 1%
beta-mercaptoethanol at - 80C. RNA was extracted from
homogenized bone or marrow lysates using Trizol (Ambion),
QIAshredder, and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.). For
each tissue, RNA was treated with an RNase-free DNase set
(Qiagen, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer’s in-
structions. RNA quality and quantity were determined using
a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). The RNA quality was
conﬁrmed by electrophoresis using the 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies).
Following the manufacturer’s recommendations, RNA was
reversed transcribed and simultaneously used for qPCR using
the GoTaq Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega).
Portions of the following mouse gene sequences were am-
pliﬁed using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Bio-
systems, Inc.): receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B
ligand (Rankl, assay ID: Mm00441906_m1), Osteoprotegerin
(Opg, assay ID: Mm01205928_m1), Tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (Tnf, assay ID: Mm00443260_g1), monocyte chemotactic
protein-1 (Mcp1, assay ID: Mm00441242_m1), interleukin-6
(Il6, assay ID Mm00446190_m1), tartrate-resistant acid phos-
phatase (Acp5, assay ID: Mm00475698_m1), cathepsin-K (Ctk,
assay ID: Mm00484039_m1), nuclear factor of activated T-
cells, cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1, assay ID: Mm00479445_m1),
nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2 (Nfe2l2, assay ID:
Mm00477784_m1), and colony-stimulating factor 1 (Csf1,
assay ID: Mm00432686_m1). We standardized gene ex-
pression levels to mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19
(L19, assay ID: Mm02601633_g1) to correct for differences
in cellular input and RNA quality and facilitate comparison
between samples. Hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyl-
transferase (Hprt1, assay ID: Mm01545399_m1) and trans-
membrane protein 40 (Tmem40, assay ID: Mm00460636_m1)
also were analyzed as alternate housekeeping genes. The
reactions were performed in the 7300 RT-PCR system (Applied
Biosystems) or SmartCycler real-time PCR system (Cepheid).
We analyzed multiple candidate housekeeping genes for
normalization, including L19, Hprt1, and Tmem40. Gamma
radiation exposure did not modulate levels of the gene L19
at the various time points, but transiently and modestly in-
creased gene expression of Hprt1 (-0.4 cycles, 1.4-fold) and
Tmem40 (-1 cycle, 2.3-fold). Following iron irradiation, L19
(as well as Hprt1) showed small increases in cycle number
due to treatment (-0.4 cycles, 1.4-fold for L19). As these
differences in housekeeping gene expression were small
relative to those of cytokine and resorption marker levels,
results reported were normalized relative to L19 for both
gamma and iron irradiation experiments.
Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b
Blood was collected from the heart at the time of eutha-
nasia and serum was separated and stored at - 80C until
processed. Enzyme immunoassays were performed for
measurement of tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase
5b
(TRACP 5b), a biomarker for osteoclast-mediated bone re-
sorption, using a commercial kit (Immunodiagnostic Sys-
tems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Statistics
All data are reported as mean – standard deviation. To
determine signiﬁcant differences compared with sham-
irradiated controls, a 1-way analysis of variance was used
followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test. If data were determined
to be heteroscedastic (Bartlett’s test), a Welch’s ANOVA
test followed by a post hoc test using the Bonferroni cor-
rection were used to determine signiﬁcant differences from
the sham-irradiated controls. Correlation analyses were
performed on expression levels of select genes from marrow
and bone specimens following gamma irradiation (for the
sham and 1, 3, and 7 day endpoints) using the Pearson’s
product-moment coefﬁcient (r). A P value £ 0.05 was ac-
cepted as signiﬁcant for all analyses. All analyses were per-
formed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS).
Results
Cancellous microarchitecture following
iron irradiation
To determine the extent of bone loss over the short term,
mice were irradiated with 56Fe ions (600 MeV) or were
sham irradiated (0 Gy controls), then 7 days later bones were
harvested and cancellous microarchitecture in the proximal
tibia quantiﬁed ex vivo using 3D microcomputed tomography.
Body weights of irradiated and control animals at the time of
tissue harvest did not differ (data not shown). Compared with
sham controls, irradiation with 2 Gy reduced BV/TV by 16%,
Tb.N by 15%, and showed a trend of increased Tb.Sp by 11%
(P = 0.053, ANOVA), but did not affect trabecular thickness
(Fig. 1). This is consistent with previous reports (Hamilton
and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010). We included a
basal group in our experiments showing BV/TV of 25.1% –
3.6%, which was not different from the age-matched sham
control group. A lower dose of iron (5cGy) failed to elicit
changes in bone structural parameters compared with controls
and is therefore below the threshold dose for causing bone
loss (data not shown). These results validate the model of
ionizing radiation-induced cancellous bone loss.

Marrow gene expression following iron irradiation
To determine if irradiation altered expression of various
pro-osteoclastogenic genes, mRNA levels in bone marrow
cell lysates were measured using quantitative RT-PCR 3
days after exposure to high-LET iron or sham irradiation.
Within 3 days of exposure, iron irradiation increased ex-
pression of the Rankl gene by 9.2-fold compared with sham-
irradiated controls (Fig. 2). At this time point, transcripts of
Opg and Mcp1 were not detected in the marrow (data not
shown). Radiation exposure did not alter Tnf expression
(Fig. 2). In contrast, a lower dose of iron (5 cGy) did not
elicit changes in gene expression (data not shown). These
data demonstrated that high-LET particulate irradiation with
2 Gy elicited pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine expression in
the bone marrow tissue.
Gene expression of skeletal tissue following
iron irradiation
To determine if ionizing radiation altered expression of
select genes related to osteoclastogenesis (Rankl, Opg) and
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (Ctk, Acp5) in cells
within the mineralized compartment of skeletal tissue, RNA
was puriﬁed from bone after removal of the marrow (leaving
predominantly osteocytes). Within 3 days, iron irradiation
increased expression of Rankl by 1.9-fold, Acp5 by 1.5-fold,
and Ctk by 2.1-fold over sham controls (Fig. 3). Expression
levels of Opg did not change. The ratio of Rankl/Opg ex-
pression increased 2.8-fold, which provides a relative index
that, on balance, cytokine levels favored increased bone
resorption.
Marrow gene expression following
gamma irradiation
To determine whether irradiation altered osteoclastogenic
and inﬂammation-related genes, mRNA expression was
measured in bone marrow at 4 h or 1, 3, or 7 days after low-
LET gamma irradiation and in sham-irradiated controls.
Within 4 h, 2 Gy gamma irradiation elevated Rankl in bone
marrow by 2.6-fold over the sham; gene expression of Opg
was undetectable regardless of treatment (data not shown).
Subsequently, the expression of many genes of interest
measured in bone marrow (Rankl, Csf1, Nfatc1, Tnf, Mcp1,
and Il6) transiently increased within 1 day and subsequently
declined toward sham levels (Fig. 4). Expression of Tnf
remained elevated through day 3 post-irradiation, while high
Rankl expression persisted through day 7 post-irradiation.
At their peak, expression of pro-osteoclastogenic genes,
Rankl and Csf1, and the osteoclast-related transcription
factor, Nfatc1, increased by 4.1-fold, 4.2-fold, and 2.0-fold,
respectively (Fig. 4A, D, E); the Rankl decoy receptor Opg
showed a trend toward increased expression by 11.3-fold
(P = 0.053 by ANOVA, Fig. 4B); pro-inﬂammatory genes
Tnf, Mcp1, and Il6 increased by 1.7-fold, 11.9-fold, and 1.6-
fold, respectively (Fig. 4F, G, H), relative to controls. The
ratio of Rankl/Opg increased by 1.8-fold at day 7 after ir-
radiation (Fig. 4C). Additionally, radiation exposure showed
a trend toward increased gene expression of Nfe2l2 by 1.6-
fold on day 1 compared with controls (P = 0.061 for the
ANOVA, Fig. 4I). Notably, levels of Nfe2l2 expression were
strongly and positively correlated with the osteoclast-related
genes Nfatc1 (P < 0.05, r = 0.89), Csf1 (P < 0.05, r = 0.63),
Tnf (P < 0.05, r = 0.62), and Rankl (P < 0.05, r = 0.56). These
data show the temporal dependence of changes in cytokine
gene expression in the marrow following radiation exposure.
Gene expression of skeletal tissue following
gamma irradiation
Following gamma irradiation, mRNA levels in femoral
mineralized tissue (sans marrow) were quantiﬁed at 3 and 7
days after irradiation or sham using qRT-PCR normalized to the
housekeeping gene, L19, as shown in Fig. 5. Within 3 days,
gamma radiation exposure increased the expression of Rankl
(2.3-fold), Acp5 (2.2-fold), and Ctk (2.3-fold). Expression of

Tnf, Opg, Nfe2l2, and the Rankl/Opg ratio was not changed
(Fig. 5). These data suggest that bone-embedded and/or lining
cells contribute to osteoclast stimulation and provide evidence
for elevated expression of osteoclastogenic (Rankl) and re-
sorption-related (Acp5, Ctk) genes in the skeletal tissue.
Serum TRACP 5b following gamma irradiation
To determine if temporal changes in skeletal gene ex-
pression (Figs. 4 and 5) coincide with changes in a protein
biomarker of resorption, the circulating levels of osteo-
clast-speciﬁc TRACP 5b were measured at 1, 3, and 7 days
after gamma irradiation and in sham controls. Gamma ir-
radiation increased TRACP 5b serum levels by 34% on
day 1 and 17% on day 3 compared with sham, with a
subsequent gradual decline toward control levels by day 7
(data not shown). Thus, circulating TRACP 5b levels
showed a similar time course, although lower in magnitude
compared with skeletal gene expression for Rankl and
other pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines.

radiation exposure and the manifestation of cancellous tis-
sue loss. In summary, the results show that exposure to
either gamma or heavy-ion radiation increased gene ex-
pression for the canonical osteoclastogenic factor, Rankl, as
well as other pro-osteoclast cytokines (Mcp1, Tnf, Il6); this
occurred in both marrow and mineralized tissue. These
ﬁndings do not distinguish between changes in gene ex-
pression levels due to a shift in the cell population expres-
sing osteoclastogenic cytokines, a generally higher level of
expression for all the cells, or some combination of both. In
fact, after exposure to radiation of sufﬁcient dosage, there
are pronounced, if transient, changes in marrow cell via-
bility and increases in marrow macrophages, which are
likely to contribute to the generation of new osteoclasts.
Therefore, we interpret our results to show that exposure to
ionizing radiation increased the tissue concentrations of
mRNA levels generally so as to favor osteoclastogenesis.
Radiation-induced changes in cytokine expression were
temporally related to changes in several indices of bone
resorption, including gene expression (Ctk, Acp5, Nfatc1)
and a serum biomarker (TRACP 5b levels). In addition,
marrow expression of the global antioxidant transcription
factor, Nfe2l2, showed high correlation with the expression
levels of several osteoclast-related genes. These data indi-
cate that the activation of oxidative defenses and of osteo-
clast formation was temporally associated in response to
radiation exposure. Our previous work showed radiation-in-
duced oxidative damage presents later, at 10 days after ex-
posure (Kondo and others 2010). Taken together, our results
indicate that Nfe2l2-related antioxidant defense pathways
were insufﬁcient to prevent oxidative damage in bone.
Changes in gene expression (as early as 4 h or 1 day)
preceded bone loss, which manifested in these experiments
by day 7 after exposure to 2 Gy iron, although in some cases
such as gamma irradiation and lower doses of iron, decre-
ments in cancellous bone volume can be observed as early
as 3 days after exposure (Kondo and others 2009; Yumoto
and others 2010). Furthermore, a dose threshold was ob-
served, as 5 cGy iron exposure failed to elicit changes in
cytokine gene expression in the marrow or cancellous bone
structure (data not shown); these ﬁndings provide additional
indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that early
induction of osteoclastogenic cytokine gene expression by
biologically effective doses of radiation leads to cancellous
bone loss.
Together, the results demonstrate that radiation-induced
structural changes were associated with a marrow environ-
ment favoring stimulation of osteoclast differentiation and
activity by Rankl and other inﬂammation-related cytokines as
follows: Radiation increased gene expression levels for pro-
osteoclastogenic signaling molecules (Csf1, Rankl, Tnf), as
well as a trend toward increasing antiosteoclastogenic mole-
cules (Opg), in the marrow and mineralized tissue of irradiated
mice compared with sham controls. Iron irradiation elevated
the ratio of Rankl/Opg in both the marrow and skeletal tissue
by day 3, whereas after gamma irradiation, the ratio was el-
evated in the marrow at 4 h and then again at day 7.
A rapid stimulation of Rankl expression by irradiation in
the marrow and bone compartment, potentially from he-
matopoietic lineage cells (Paciﬁci 2010, 2012; Fumoto and
others 2014) or stromal lineage cells (Suda and others 1999;
Boyle and others 2003), is consistent with studies that used
radiotherapeutic doses and regimens. In young mice, a sin-
gle dose of 5 or 10 Gy increased Rankl/Opg in whole femora
within 3 days (Han and others 2014). Using mice deﬁcient
in the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, radiation
exposure at high dose (20 Gy) increased RNA expression for
Rankl in cultured osteoblasts grown ex vivo, but this was not
observed in cells from wild-type mice (Rana and others
2012). These ﬁndings suggest an Nfe2l2-mediated increase
in expression of antioxidant enzymes may dampen bone
resorption responses to radiation.
Furthermore, when a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7)
capable of differentiating into osteoclast-like cells after
RANKL treatment is exposed to ionizing radiation (2 Gy
gamma), gene expression levels rise for b3 integrin, an
adhesion receptor that is important for osteoclast differen-
tiation, as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-
B (Rank), the receptor for Rankl on osteoclasts (Yang and
others 2012). In other in vitro work, irradiation with 2 or
4 Gy increases Rankl in differentiated, MC3T3-E1 osteo-
blast-like cells (Yang and others 2013). Our work is the ﬁrst
to demonstrate the time course of radiation-induced changes
in expression of various osteoclastogenic cytokines follow-
ing 2 Gy exposure (both low- and high-LET) with subse-
quent bone loss and within the upper range of space-relevant
doses and types of radiation.
Ionizing radiation also increased tissue expression of pro-
inﬂammatory, osteoclastogenic ligands, Mcp1, Tnf, and Il6,
which are all factors generally thought to stimulate osteo-
clast activity (Takayanagi 2007) in the presence of RANKL
(Kostenuik and Shalhoub 2001; Yu and others 2004; Kim
and others 2005, 2006; Sul and others 2012; Liu and others
2013). In some reports, TNF may act independently of
RANKL to stimulate osteoclastogenesis (Kobayashi and
others 2000). Our results are consistent with other work
showing that in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation leads to
rapid, complex, and interrelated sequence of signals con-
stituting an immune-related cytokine response in bone
marrow (Schaue and McBride 2010; Willey and others
2011; Schaue and others 2012; Buchwald and Aurora 2013).
At a very high dose (10 Gy), which is sufﬁcient to ablate the
bone marrow of hematopoietic cells, radiation causes bone
loss related to elevated fractalkine expression by vascular
endothelial cells, inﬂammatory cytokines Tnf, interleukin 1
beta, and interferon gamma, and recruitment of pre-
osteoclasts (CD11b) (Han and others 2014). Additionally,
the time course of cytokine and resorption-related gene
expression shown in this study coincides with that of mar-
row cell death and repopulation (Otsuka and others 2008;
Kondo and others 2010), suggesting a possible relationship
between an expanded population of marrow macrophages
clearing apoptotic cells and debris after irradiation, the
differentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts, and in-
creased resorption activity.
Taken together, these data lead us to propose a 2-stage
process
for
radiation-induced
osteoclastogenesis:
ﬁrst,
radiation-induced gene expression of osteoclastogenic cy-
tokines leads to enrichment of the marrow with osteoclast
precursors (monocyte–macrophage, myeloid lineage cells)
and drives differentiation into osteoclasts, and, second, that
inﬂammation-related cytokines co-stimulate differentiating
and mature osteoclasts.
As a functional measure of active osteoclasts, we provide
evidence that 2 Gy gamma irradiation elevated circulating
levels of osteoclast-speciﬁc TRACP 5b protein, indicative of
IONIZING RADIATION AND SKELETAL CYTOKINE GENE EXPRESSION

increased bone resorption. In this work, the radiation-in-
duced elevation in serum TRACP 5b returned to control
levels by day 7 following exposure, These results are con-
sistent with those reported by Willey and others (2010,
2011) showing that X-irradiation (2 Gy) of female mice
increases circulating TRACP 5b levels 1, 3, and 7 days after
irradiation.
Radiation-induced decrements in cancellous tissue ob-
served in these experiments were consistent with our pre-
vious results.
Acute cancellous bone loss temporally
manifests on day 3 at a dose as low as 10 cGy iron (Yumoto
and others 2010). Persistent structural decrements (lasting
> 1 week) manifest at doses above *50 cGy iron (Yumoto
and others 2010) and 1 Gy gamma exposure (Hamilton and
others 2006; Kondo and others 2010) before being over-
taken, in the case of gamma irradiation, by age-related bone
loss (Alwood and others 2012). Taken together, given the
observed time course of skeletal gene expression and serum
resorption markers, we conclude that the structural deﬁcits
arose from a spike in osteoclastogenic cytokine expression
that follows exposure to ionizing radiation (Kondo and
others 2009; Willey and others 2010).
Limitations of this work include the dose rate used to
model space radiation. It is an open question whether lower
dose rate exposures that constitute true space radiation
stimulate osteoclasts and bone loss to the same extent as the
exposures used here. In addition, other signaling molecules,
including various other cytokines not studied here, are likely
also to play a role in regulating bone resorption after chal-
lenge with ionizing radiation, while changes in osteoblast
lineage cells are likely to be important for maintaining
structural integrity at later times post-irradiation.
In conclusion, an improved understanding of the molec-
ular response to radiation exposure may aid the development
of biological treatments to mitigate potentially deleterious
skeletal consequences during space ﬂight.
