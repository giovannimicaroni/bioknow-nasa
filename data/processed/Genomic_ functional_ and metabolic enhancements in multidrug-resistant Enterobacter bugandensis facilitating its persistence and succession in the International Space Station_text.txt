Abstract 
Background  The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space explora-
tion. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2 levels, and elevated solar 
radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing 
the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobac-
ter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported 
to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections.
Results  Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms 
that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formida-
ble resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug-
resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive 
study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison to terrestrial strains, 
with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal 
genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis 
central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, 
could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence 
and distribution of E. bugandensis across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the per-
sistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging 
advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities

Introduction
Microorganisms within built environments profoundly 
affect the health of inhabitants. The International Space 
Station (ISS), a highly controlled built environment 
harbouring extreme conditions such as microgravity, 
solar radiation, and elevated CO2 levels, offers a unique 
place for studying microbial survival and adaptation [1]. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms 
exposed to microgravity can acquire antibiotic resistance 
and heightened virulence via rapid mutations and hori-
zontal gene transfer [2–4]. Prolonged space travel under 
microgravity can also compromise astronauts’ immune 
systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases [5]. The 
microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact 
astronauts’ microbiomes and get replenished by the 
arrival of new crew  [6]. Thus, understanding microbial 
colonisation, succession, and interactions is pivotal for 
ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial 
risks in isolated and confined human habitats. Persistent 
efforts have been made to monitor the ISS microbiome 
through multiple microbial tracking missions [3, 7], iden-
tifying novel microorganisms [8–11], studying antibiotic 
resistance [12] to unveiling microbial interactions [13].
Enterobacter bugandensis, a newly recognised species, 
emerges as one of the important opportunistic pathogens 
within the Enterobacter genus and has been isolated pre-
dominantly from clinical specimens [14, 15]. Species from 
this Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic genus exist in 
various environments, from soil to the human gut [16]. In 
addition, some Enterobacter species act as opportunistic 
human pathogens, causing nosocomial infections with 
bacteremia, lower respiratory tract, osteomyelitis, sep-
sis, and urinary tract infection [17]. Moreover, with time, 
Enterobacter isolates have been shown to manifest multi-
drug resistance (MDR) mechanisms, including extended-
spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, AmpC 
overexpression, and altered membrane permeability [18], 
and have been designated as a member of ESKAPE path-
ogen group, recognised for their antimicrobial resistance 
prowess. Interestingly, recent studies have reported the 
isolation of 13 multi-drug resistant E. bugandensis strains 
from the ISS during the Microbial Tracking  1 (MT-1) 
mission [1, 19]. Motivated by the presence of E. bugan-
densis on the ISS, our central aim was to compare ISS-
derived E.  bugandensis genomes with their terrestrial 
counterparts, with an emphasis on clinical isolates. We 
trace the evolutionary dynamics of pivotal genes, includ-
ing those involved in putative functional adaptations and 
potential antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, possibly 
driven by the unique stresses of space.
Expanding our investigations, we further examined 
metagenomic reads to map the prevalence of E. bugan-
densis across diverse ISS locations, capturing its temporal 
dynamics. In addition, we explored the coexisting micro-
bial communities of E. bugandensis in ISS across multiple 
flights and locations. Subsequently, the intricate micro-
bial interactions of E.  bugandensis within the ISS were 
unveiled using a combination of robust computational 
approaches. This comprehensive analysis (Fig. 1) not only 
sheds light on how these interactions influence microbial 
diversity and contribute to the potential succession of 
E. bugandensis within the unique ISS habitat but also aids 
in designing strategic preventive measures against infec-
tions caused by pathogens.
Results
Phylogenetic distinction of ISS E. bugandensis 
from terrestrial isolates
We obtained 211 assembled genomes, annotated as 
E.  bugandensis, from the publicly available National 
Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI) Gen-
Bank sequence database [20]. Among these genomes, 12 
were isolated from three different locations aboard the 
ISS during the first Flight of the MT-1 mission: four from 
the Air Control (AC) samples, one from the Advanced 
Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and seven from the 
Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Additionally, 
one metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was recov-
ered from the WHC samples. To ensure the taxonomic 
affiliation of these genomes, we calculated the aver-
age nucleotide identity (ANI) by comparing them to the 
E. bugandensis type-strain EB-247T (= DSM ­29888T) [14]. 
alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate 
microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS.
Conclusions  Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity 
but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within the ISS 
environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adapta-
tion, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive 
measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic 
threats.

The ANI values of all 211 strains examined ranged from 
97.74 to 100%, confirming their species-level taxonomic 
affiliation (>  95%)  [21]. The genomes isolated from the 
ISS exhibited an average ANI of 98.61%. Furthermore, we 
observed that E. bugandensis was predominantly isolated 
from human hosts, accounting for approximately 81% of 
all isolates, followed by non-human hosts/environmen-
tal sources (11%). Detailed information on the genomes, 
including their isolation sources, ANI, as well as other 
relevant aspects, are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
We employed four different phylogeny construc-
tion methods, including single-copy core gene-based 
(n = 172 marker genes) and SNP-based approaches and 
found that the ISS genomes formed a separate clade 
from strains present in other Earth environments and 
hosts (Figs.  2 and  3, Supplementary Fig.  1). Notably, 
one strain, AR1358 from Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, 
Zhejiang, China, clustered closely with the ISS isolates 
across all trees. To investigate deeper into the ISS strains’ 
placement, we compared them to the E.  bugandensis 
type-strain EB-247T and closely related human isolate, 
AR1358, at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
and other mutational levels. The ISS isolates showed an 
average of 36,044 (s.d. = 24.04) SNPs compared to the 
type-strain. We found that ISS strains had significantly 
more SNPs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p-value = 0.019) 
than the closely associated human isolates (strains in 
the right panel of Fig. 2). A comparative analysis of ISS 
strains with the closest Earth strain, AR1358, revealed 
significant differences of 3238 SNPs, 14 indels, and 578 
complex mutations on average. However, these genetic 
variations were evenly observed among the isolates. An 
SNP-based tree showed the ISS isolates form a separate 
clade even from the closest Earth strain, indicating iso-
lates from other sources (e.g. leaves, human urine, sea-
water) did not cluster with ISS strains in our SNP-based 
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results reveal that 
E. bugandensis strains from the ISS show notable genetic 
differences compared to their Earth counterparts. This 
prompted us to investigate deeper into the comparative 
genomics, antimicrobial traits, and functional features 
of ISS strains, especially in relation to other microorgan-
isms they coexist with.
E. bugandensis strains isolated from the ISS might have 
evolved functionally under extreme conditions
We identified and annotated every open reading frame 
(ORFs, i.e. coding sequences of isolated genomes) in 
each of the 211 genomes/MAG. Our analysis yielded a 
total of 945,562 coding sequences (CDS) with 2660 dis-
tinct Clusters of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotations. 
Although the above-mentioned phylogenetic analyses 
suggested genetic variations in the E. bugandensis strains 
from the ISS, they did not clarify how these variations 
translate into functional changes. A comparative analy-
sis of COGs across all 211 genomes revealed that the

ISS genomes exhibited a relatively higher average gene 
count in categories such as amino acid transport and 
metabolism, mobilome (prophages and transposons), 
and transcription factors (Supplementary Table  1). To 
better understand these COG patterns, we constructed 
a presence–absence matrix for unique COGs across 
the genomes, followed by hierarchical clustering. This 
approach also identified a distinct clade formed by the 
ISS genomes, indicating not only genetic divergence 
but also functional distinctiveness compared to other 
E. bugandensis strains (Fig. 3). We further identified 14 
COGs exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100%) 
while being rarely detected in Earth genomes (<  10%). 
These encompass a range of functions, including amino 
acid transport and metabolism (COG2423), cell wall/
membrane/envelope biogenesis (COG0464, COG4678), 
mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545), 
transcription (COG0454, COG0864), and others with yet 
unknown or predicted functions.
For a comprehensive understanding, we constructed 
a pan-genome comprising 13,936 gene clusters, includ-
ing 3836 core and 10,100 accessory gene clusters across 
all isolated E.  bugandensis strains (Supplementary 
Fig. 2). The ISS genomes exhibited an average of 4568 
genes, a significantly higher count than the average of 
4416 genes found in the Earth genomes. Focusing on 
the additional genes, we similarly identified a distinct 
subset exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100% 
present in ISS genomes and < 10% in Earth genomes). 
This subset comprised 82 non-hypothetical genes, 
though annotations for these genes remained limited. 
This subset included genes such as alanine racemase, 
biosynthetic (alr), lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding 
periplasmic protein (argT), fragments of the astCADBE 
operon, and others pivotal in amino acid transport and 
metabolism. Additionally, a prevalence of transcrip-
tional regulator genes observed, including HTH-type 
transcriptional repressors (comR, rspR, yahB, nimR,

yhjB, yybR), transcriptional repressor PifC, and penta-
chlorophenol (PCP) degradation transcriptional activa-
tion protein. We also noticed the presence of essential 
elements such as the two-component regulatory sys-
tem BvgAS, known for its pivotal role in controlling the 
expression of virulence factors and genes crucial for 
bacterial adaptation and pathogenicity. Furthermore, 
stress-associated genes like antitoxin components of 
the type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system (antitoxin HigA, 
antitoxin SocA, antitoxin ParD1, toxin ParE1) and SOS 
response systems (LexA repressor, ATP-dependent 
zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4) were notable findings. 
Transporters also featured prominently in that gene 
set, encompassing histidine transport system permease 
proteins (hisM, hisP, hisQ), octopine transport system 
permease protein occM, inner membrane transport 
protein YdhP, and glutamine transport ATP-binding 
protein GlnQ (glnQ).
These observations motivated a comprehensive gene-
level pan-genome association study with the aim of 
unravelling the genes linked with E. bugandensis in the 
ISS. Effectively accounting for population stratification 
due to shared lineages, we performed genome-wide asso-
ciations among 4696 gene sequences, ranging from 5 to 
100% occurrence across all genomes. Importantly, our 
study further underscored the significant association of 
previously identified genes, from the pan-genome study, 
with ISS adaptation after adjustments for false discovery 
rates ( pBH < 0.001) (Supplementary Table 1).
Presence of antibiotic resistance genes and mechanisms 
in ISS E. bugandensis
In the E. bugandensis genomes collected from the ISS, we 
looked for antibiotic resistance genes using the CARD 
database [22] and calculated sequence identity with the 
reference databases (Supplementary Table 1). We found 
that these genomes harbour resistance to 23 different 
multidrug classes, including cephalosporin, cephamycin, 
fluoroquinolone, and nitroimidazole antibiotics. Nota-
bly, a gene from the ACT β-lactamase family (ACT-77) 
was present across all 13 genomes, exhibiting 99.48% 
sequence identity and 100% coverage. Additionally, we 
identified other MDR genes, such as cyclic AMP receptor 
protein (Crp), fosfomycin resistance gene (fosA2), and 
histone-like protein H-NS (H-NS), showing sequence 
identities of 99.05%, 96.45%, and 95.59%, respectively. 
Further, a total of 35 antibiotic resistance ontologies 
(ARO) were predicted across almost all the ISS E. bugan-
densis genomes.
We then looked into the mechanism of antibiotic 
resistance and identified four mechanisms: antibiotic tar-
get alteration, antibiotic efflux, reduced permeability to 
antibiotics, and antibiotic inactivation. Moreover, certain 
organisms utilised combinations of these mechanisms

strains

to gain resistance against the antibiotics. However, these 
genes and mechanisms are not exclusive to ISS strains 
and are found in other Earth species as well (Supplemen-
tary Fig.  3). Since the ISS genomes are closely associ-
ated with the human isolates (Fig. 2), these findings raise 
concerns about potential significant antibiotic resistance 
within the ISS environment.
Microbial co‑occurrence network reveals potential 
succession of E. bugandensis in ISS
Next, we focused on investigating the potential succes-
sion of E. bugandensis in the challenging environment of 
the ISS. To achieve this, we conducted a detailed analysis 
of metagenomic reads derived from 42 samples collected 
during the MT-1 mission and assessed the abundance of 
E. bugandensis in the ISS (details in the “Methods” sec-
tion). Further, we segregated the samples into two groups 
based on the samples treated with and without propidium 
monoazide (PMA). Our analysis revealed the evidence of 
potential succession of E.  bugandensis across the envi-
ronments within the ISS during multiple flights (Fig. 4, 
Supplementary Fig. 4). Being interested in understanding 
microbial interactions, we focused on the samples treated 
with PMA, to account only for viable and intact micro-
organisms [23]. During Flight 1, E. bugandensis demon-
strated substantial abundance in four distinct locations 
(1, 2, 3, and 5). This prevalence underwent a reduction 
during the subsequent Flight 2, with only two locations 
(3 and 5) displaying its presence. We further noticed a 
resurgence in the prevalence of E.  bugandensis during 
the third flight, being present in all sampled locations. 
The highest abundance of E. bugandensis was observed 
in Location 2 (forward side panel wall of the WHC) dur-
ing Flight 1 (relative abundance = 86.7%). However, the 
median of the absolute read counts for E.  buganden-
sis was less during Flight  1 (1530) when compared to 
Flight 2 (1698) and Flight 3 (2673). Sampling at precise 
locations identified during Flight 1 facilitated continu-
ity in the microbial monitoring carried out in Flights 2 
and 3. This approach was instrumental in decoding the 
microbial succession patterns on the surfaces within the 
ISS. The emergence of novel microbial populations may 
correlate with the crew transition from Flight 2 to Flight 
3. An earlier study by Checinska et al. had reported that 
no environmental parameters had been altered during 
the flights [1].
Moving forward, we probed into the microbial com-
munities coexisting with E.  bugandensis within the ISS 
environments. We focused on bacteria that displayed a 
relative abundance of > 1% alongside E. bugandensis in 
the metagenomic samples. This analysis revealed sev-
eral patterns in the microbial co-occurring networks, as 
shown in Fig.  5. During Flight  1, we observed distinct 
microbial dominance among the four locations where 
E.  bugandensis was prevalent. For instance, Location  1 
was characterised by a prevalence of Klebsiella, Loca-
tion 3 by Methylobacterium, and Location 5 by Pantoea, 
while E. bugandensis itself held dominance in Location 2. 
However, during Flight  2, E.  bugandensis presence was 
limited to Locations 3 and 5. In Location 3, we noticed 
an exciting abundance of Gram-positive bacteria, includ-
ing Corynebacterium sp. sy039, Cutibacterium acnes,

Paenibacillus polymyxa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 
Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 431. In contrast, Location 5 
was dominated by members of the Erwiniaceae family, 
such as Erwinia and Pantoea species. While the abun-
dance profile of E.  bugandensis remained almost con-
sistent across ISS flights, during Flight 3, E. bugandensis 
showed its adaptability, occupying nearly all ISS locations 
(Fig. 4B). A family-level diversity analysis highlighted the 
continued dominance of the Erwiniaceae family, particu-
larly the Pantoea genus, in most locations (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4). Nevertheless, Location 3 exhibited significant 
abundance of Staphylococcaceae. The details of absolute 
and relative abundances of organisms and their co-pres-
ence network are provided in Supplementary Table 2.
E. bugandensis potentially influences metabolic dynamics 
of coexisting microorganisms
We further investigated the metabolic interactions 
among these co-occurring microorganisms of E. bugan-
densis. For this, we constructed 47 genome-scale meta-
bolic models and simulated them on the described media 
(details in the “Methods” section). To evaluate the effect 
of the surrounding bacteria on E. bugandensis metabo-
lism, we calculated the pairwise Metabolic Support 
Index (MSI) for 957 identified communities. MSI is a 
directional measure that indicates the gain in metabolic 
potential of a microorganism while in a community com-
pared to its isolated state.
In our findings, we observed 645 nonzero MSI interac-
tions ranging from 0.069 to 1.061%. Specifically focusing 
on the predicted interactions involving E.  bugandensis, 
we noticed that it can provide significant metabolic ben-
efits to Gram-positive microorganisms (Fig. 6A). Notably, 
Staphylococcus saprophyticus from Flight 1, Location 1, 
received the highest MSI of 1.06% among others, fol-
lowed closely by Staphylococcus hominis (0.96%) at 
Flight  3, Location  2, and Staphylococcus epidermidis 
(0.96%) during Flight  2, Location  3. Additionally, we 
observed a slight metabolic advantage for organisms 
from the Erwiniaceae family in their interactions with 
E. bugandensis. The genus Methylobacterium received an 
average MSI of 0.11%. Furthermore, E. bugandensis did 
not derive significant metabolic benefits (< 0.1%) from 
any coexisting organisms. This suggests that E.  bugan-
densis possibly maintains metabolic competitiveness 
within these communities.
E. bugandensis is predicted to affect the growth 
of coexisting microorganisms
To investigate the impact of the microbial community 
on microbial growth, we employed the constraint-based 
method SteadyCom  [24] to analyse the interactions 
between E.  bugandensis and its coexisting microbiota. 
Based on the changes in growth rate as compared to 
wild-type conditions, we classified the interactions into 
six types (described in the “Methods” section). Our anal-
ysis predicted a total of 947 pairwise interactions across 
seven locations during three flights of the MT-1 mis-
sion. Among these interactions, we observed a preva-
lence of “negative” interactions, such as parasitism (441) 
and amensalism (412), followed by 34 mutualistic, 31 
competitive, 26 commensalistic, and three neutral inter-
actions. Focusing on E.  bugandensis, we explored 126 
interactions with its coexisting microorganisms. Among 
these, 63 were parasitic, where E. bugandensis predomi-
nantly acted as the parasitic organism while reaping ben-
efits from other organisms. Additionally, we noted 45 
amensalism, 12 mutualistic, four commensalistic, and 
two competitive interactions involving E. bugandensis.
Notably, Pantoea species were prominent in inter-
actions with E.  bugandensis during all three flights. 
While Pantoea was mainly present in Location  5 dur-
ing flights 1 and 2, it appeared in almost all ISS locations 
during Flight  3. E.  bugandensis significantly reduced 
growth rates for several Pantoea strains, including Pan-
toea  agglomerans, Pantoea alhagi, Pantoea dispersa 
625, Pantoea rwandensis, Pantoea  sp. At-9b, Pantoea 
sp. CCBC3-3-1, Pantoea sp. PSNIH1, Pantoea sp. SO10, 
Pantoea stewartii, and  Pantoea vagans, suggesting its 
parasitic role. However, one exception was Pantoea 
ananatis PA13, which showed mutualism with E. bugan-
densis, leading to a significant growth advantage for 
both microorganisms (Fig. 6B). Moreover, in the family 
Erwiniaceae, microorganisms like Erwinia gerundensis, 
Mixta calida, and Mixta gaviniae, displayed parasitism, 
while Mixta theicola displayed amensalistic interactions,

favouring growth advantage for E. bugandensis. Escheri-
chia coli also interacted amensalistically with E. bugan-
densis at Location  1 during Flight  1, leading to its 
significant growth reduction. Another group of patho-
genic species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella quasip-
neumoniae, Klebsiella sp. LY, and Klebsiella variicola, 
coexisted with E.  bugandensis during Flight  1 and 3 in 
several locations. E.  bugandensis exhibited amensalistic 
interactions with Klebsiella species, leading to a nega-
tive growth rate for Klebsiella. Conversely, E. bugandensis 
displayed parasitism towards K. aerogenes (Fig. 6B).
E.  bugandensis also displayed positive associations 
with certain Gram-positive bacteria. Paenibacillus  pol-
ymyxa, present in Locations  3 and 5 during Flight  2, 
showed commensalism in the presence of E. bugandensis, 
resulting in a growth advantage. Additionally, Staphy-
lococcus  epidermidis and Staphylococcus  saprophyticus 
exhibited mutualism, while Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 
431 displayed commensalism. E.  bugandensis demon-
strated competitive interaction against closely associated 
species Enterobacteriaceae bacterium S05 and amensal-
isitic to Enterobacter  cloacae with a negative effect on 
E. bugandensis.
Interestingly, in Location  3 of Flight  1, we observed 
that several Methylobacterium species interacted with 
E. bugandensis in a parasitic manner. This facilitated an 
increased growth for Methylobacterium and subsequently 
a decreased growth for E. bugandensis (Fig. 5B). Methylo-
bacterium phyllosphaerae had the most significant effect 
from this interaction. However, a few Methylobacterium 
species, including Methylobacterium aquaticum, Methy-
lobacterium brachiatum, Methylobacterium durans, and 
Methylobacterium mesophilicum SR1.6/6, showed com-
mensalistic, mutualistic, mutualistic, and amensalism 
interactions, respectively. Detailed information on the 
nature of interactions for all pairs can be found in Sup-
plementary Table 3.
Discussion
In this study, we discussed the adaptation of a multid-
rug-resistant, nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen, E.  bugan-
densis, in the unique built environment of the ISS, and 
its potential succession. Several studies have highlighted 
the prevalence of microorganisms on ISS surfaces asso-
ciated with humans, including opportunistic pathogens 
and discussed the importance of studying them  [1, 3]. 
E.  bugandensis, which is also an opportunistic patho-
gen, was observed to be present in the ISS during the 
cataloguing of viable microbial communities [1, 19]. Such 
organisms pose potential threats to astronauts on the ISS, 
though the exact mechanisms behind their behaviour in 
space remain unknown. The impact on astronaut health 
would likely depend on individual health status and how 
these microorganisms function in extreme space envi-
ronments. Hence, it is crucial to explore genomic and 
metabolic studies to understand the functionality of 
these microorganisms and their potential implications 
for astronaut well-being. While some attempts have been 
made to understand the effect of pathogens like A. pit-
tii [25] and K. pneumoniae [13, 26] under stress condi-
tions on the ISS, there is still much more to explore.
In this study, we have not limited our analyses to a 
mere comparison between Earth and ISS isolates of 
E.  bugandensis. Instead, we adopted a unique threefold 
approach to unravel the potential succession of E. bugan-
densis in the ISS. Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive 
genome-wide analysis to identify the genomic and func-
tionality changes acquired by E.  bugandensis during its 
adaptation to the extreme space environment. Secondly, 
we quantified the abundance of E. bugandensis in the ISS 
across multiple flights of the MT-1 mission. Additionally, 
we looked into the coexisting microbial population of 
E. bugandensis through a detailed metagenomic analysis. 
Lastly, we elucidated the metabolic interactions of these 
organisms and how they contribute to shaping the com-
munity structure within the ISS. Through this multi-fac-
eted approach, we were able to explain the survival and 
dynamics of E. bugandensis in the ISS environment.
Recent studies have also indicated the potential role 
of increased amino acid biosynthesis in the success-
ful colonisation of stressed environments by bacteria 
such as Salmonella, which is also from the Enterobacte-
riaceae family [27]. Another operon, astCADBE, known 
to be involved in arginine and ornithine transport and 
metabolism, was present in ISS strains and plays a sig-
nificant role in virulence in enteric pathogens through 
arginine catabolism [28]. Furthermore, we identified the 
gene encoding alanine racemase, a key enzyme trans-
forming L-alanine to D-alanine—an essential step in cell 
wall biosynthesis. Under stress, this enzyme might play a 
pivotal role in bacterial adaptation and survival by facili-
tating D-alanine production for cell wall repair and main-
tenance  [29]. Moreover, the higher prevalence of genes 
in ISS genomes than their Earth counterparts strongly 
suggests that ISS strains were able to acquire essential 
accessory genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) 
events. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the 
increased abundance of COGs related to mobilome ele-
ments (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545).
Further, our analysis revealed the presence of genes 
associated with SOS response systems, including the 
LexA repressor and ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease 
FtsH 4. LexA, notably prevalent in ISS but scarce in Earth 
strains (< 10%), suggests potential selection pressure on 
E.  bugandensis’s DNA damage response, likely induced 
by the elevated radiation levels and other adversities

experienced aboard the ISS. In E. coli and various bac-
teria, the LexA protein plays a pivotal role in regulating 
the SOS response to DNA damage, influencing cellular 
adaptation to stress [30]. We also noted the existence of 
toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs), which are widely distrib-
uted among bacteria and play a critical role in the evolu-
tion and propagation of antibiotic resistance, such as the 
maintenance of multi-resistant plasmids and the induc-
tion of persistence [31]. A subset of genes related to type 
II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, including antitoxin com-
ponents (HigA, SocA, ParD1) and toxin ParE1, partici-
pates in plasmid maintenance [32], stress response [33], 
and biofilm production [31], thereby enhancing bacterial 
resilience and virulence. Additionally, the presence of 
the BvgAS two-component regulatory system, typically 
observed in Bordetella species, is of interest. This system, 
often referred to as the “master virulence regulator”, con-
trols the activation of virulence genes in various Borde-
tella species through its components: the histidine kinase 
BvgS and the response regulator BvgA [34]. Our findings 
also highlighted the presence of Imm (Colicin-E2 immu-
nity protein), a crucial element providing immunity to 
colicin E2, which are antimicrobial proteins produced 
by E. coli under stress conditions as a defence mecha-
nism  [35, 36]. Through a comprehensive genome-wide 
association study, we systematically assessed the identi-
fied genes from the pan-genome for their potential links 
to observed phenotypic traits, considering population 
stratification. We identified certain genes from our study 
that are exclusively present in organisms associated with 
the ISS, but not in their terrestrial counterpart. These 
include inner membrane protein YbjJ in Bacillus cereus 
from the ISS  [37], transcriptional repressor LexA, and 
ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH-4 in Acineto-
bacter pittii from the ISS [25], as well as the bvgAS sys-
tem in Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34, known for its 
resilience in harsh environments and also observed in the 
ISS [38]. These genes could potentially serve as valuable 
targets for therapeutics against pathogenic microorgan-
isms in the unique environment of the ISS. This analy-
sis demonstrated a distinct association of the identified 
genes with ISS isolates, further corroborating their rel-
evance to the specific environmental conditions aboard 
the ISS.
The antimicrobial resistance profile is also of interest, 
mainly due to the fact that ISS strains exhibit distinct 
phenotypes compared to their Earth-based counterparts 
yet display similar antimicrobial resistance signatures 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, Singh et al. [19] have 
indicated a significant increment in antimicrobial-resist-
ant genes during Flight  3 compared to Flights 1 and 2, 
highlighting the potential persistence of opportunistic 
pathogens in Flight 3 samples, which is also shown in our 
study. We have identified multiple MDR gene classes (14 
in total) within the ISS strains. Among these, the pres-
ence of ACT (AmpC-type cephalosporinase) β-lacta-
mase genes is interesting. Although previous studies have 
reported the presence of blaCTX−M−55 , blaNDM−5 , and 
blaIMI−1 in the broader E. bugandensis population [39], 
our analysis did not reveal these specific genes within the 
ISS strains. Additionally, we identified the vanG gene, 
typically associated with Vancomycin Resistance Locus 
primarily observed in Enterococcus faecalis [40]. Another 
finding was the presence of KpnEF, a cell envelope stress 
response regulon, and an SMR-type efflux pump associ-
ated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance, com-
monly observed in K. pneumoniae [41]. Considering the 
close genetic proximity to Earth strains, especially hos-
pital isolates like AR1358, these MDR genes and associ-
ated mechanisms raise concerns. These genetic elements 
are likely acquired by E. bugandensis through horizontal 
gene transfer (HGT) events, potentially contributing to 
their MDR capabilities.
Next, we set out to estimate the abundance of E. bugan-
densis in the ISS metagenomic samples. Our findings 
revealed that E. bugandensis exhibits prevalence and var-
ying relative abundance across different locations within 
the space station. There were no significant differences 
in the absolute abundance of E.  bugandensis between 
PMA- and non-PMA-treated samples, suggesting that 
the DNA retrieved from this opportunistic pathogen 
residing on ISS is viable and intact. E. bugandensis was 
found to be persistent across the ARED (Location 3) and 
the Zero-G Stowage Rack (ZSR; Location  5) through-
out all three flights of the MT-1 mission (Fig. 5). Despite 
its presence in all locations, the relative abundance of 
E. bugandensis was generally low, except for a substantial 
burden observed at Location 2 during Flight 1 (Supple-
mentary Table 2). These observations further motivated 
us to examine the associated microbiota co-existing with 
E. bugandensis on the ISS.
Our analysis found that E. bugandensis coexists with a 
group of Pantoea species at multiple locations across all 
flights, particularly in the ZSR (Location  5). Although 
both Enterobacter and Pantoea belong to the fam-
ily Enterobacteriaceae, they exhibit high diversity  [42] 
and have been reported to coexist in other environ-
ments, including hospital ICUs  [43] and sugarcane tis-
sues  [44]. E.  bugandensis also interacted with several 
Klebsiella species within the same family Enterobac-
teriaceae, mainly at the Cupola (Flight  1) and ARED 
(Flight  3). E.  bugandensis is a common human com-
mensal  [45, 46] but can act as an opportunistic patho-
gen, co-infecting immunocompromised individuals (e.g. 
COVID-infected patients)  [47], and have the ability to 
transfer plasmids through HGT events [48, 49]. Studies 

Page 12 of 17
Sengupta et al. Microbiome           (2024) 12:62 
have also demonstrated the co-presence of Enterobacter, 
Klebsiella, Paenibacillus, and Pantoea as bacterial endo-
phytes in cereals and Enterobacter sp., Mixta sp., and 
Pantoea sp. in germinating seeds [50]. To further explore 
and quantify their interaction patterns, we employed two 
widely applied computational approaches: (i) graph-theo-
retical approach to estimate metabolic dependencies and 
(ii) constraint-based modelling to examine the nature of 
their interactions.
Our study, while informative, does come with certain 
limitations. In our comprehensive genomic exploration 
of E. bugandensis, we uncovered genes linked to the ISS 
environment. Firstly, the limited number of E.  bugan-
densis genomes collected from the ISS, in comparison to 
Earth isolates, may impact the robustness of our genomic 
findings. One challenge we encountered was the presence 
of numerous genes with inadequate annotations, many of 
which were hypothetical proteins. A comparative study 
by Lobb et al. [48] reported that Prokka, a widely used 
annotation tool, demonstrated a mean proteome annota-
tion coverage of 52 ± 9%. However, it is essential to note 
that Prokka’s functional annotation parameters are strin-
gent, relying solely on reference proteins with experimen-
tal evidence for functional assignments. Moreover, while 
our study strongly suggests adaptation and a “potential” 
succession of E. bugandensis in the ISS environment, we 
acknowledge that true succession assessment would ide-
ally involve techniques such as qPCR or ecological-scale 
analyses. However, we strengthened our hypothesis for 
the likelihood of adaptation based on multiple converg-
ing analyses employing diverse approaches. Furthermore, 
the metabolic models we constructed are draft models 
generated from representative type strains of the organ-
isms. Although we employed default gap-filling options 
using ModelSEED, these models may still have gaps and 
could differ from the actual isolates. Despite these limita-
tions, such automated reconstruction models are widely 
used for studying metabolic characteristics and predict-
ing microbial interactions  [51]. Also, our models were 
simulated under minimal medium conditions along with 
specific cofactors, thereby representing environmen-
tal communities with limited rich medium contents. 
Although some microbial interactions might remain 
stable in various nutrient-rich settings, others may vary 
based on the distinct metabolic capacities of the interact-
ing pairs.
While exploring microbial interactions in extreme 
communities, we employed a graph-based approach 
for exploring the metabolic dependencies among the 
members. Our findings suggested that Gram-positive 
organisms (e.g.  Staphylococcus) often rely on meta-
bolic support from Gram-negative counterparts such as 
Enterobacter, Pantoea, and Klebsiella genera. Moreover, 
studies from the ISS surface microbiome of the US mod-
ule as well as the Japan module have shown that micro-
organisms belonging to the family Staphylococcaceae 
and Enterobacteriaceae were the most dominant organ-
isms on ISS surfaces [1, 52]. Focusing on E. bugandensis, 
we observed that it receives limited metabolic support 
from coexisting microorganisms, suggesting its posi-
tioning as a higher-level contributor within the commu-
nity’s food chain. In contrast, most community members 
appear to derive some form of metabolic support from 
E.  bugandensis, albeit nominal in most instances. This 
finding is consistent with recent research indicating the 
significance of Enterobacteriaceae in facilitating benefi-
cial interactions among microorganisms, whereas fami-
lies like Erwiniaceae and Staphylococcaceae contributed 
less to metabolic support  [13]. However, these interac-
tions provide a static snapshot of metabolic interaction 
potential and do not really capture the nature of interac-
tions. Thus, we introduced a complementary constraint-
based method to predict the nature of interactions based 
on growth rates. This combined approach offers a more 
comprehensive view of microbial interactions. Our inves-
tigation extended to the specific impact of E. bugandensis 
on other microorganisms. We elucidated possible effects 
on plant-associated microbes, such as Pantoea and Meth-
ylobacterium, suggesting a potential overlap in resource 
utilisation for growth (Fig. 6B). The prevalence of Methy-
lobacterium across the ISS, known for its resilience in 
challenging environments, underscores its adaptability 
to extreme conditions from NASA spacecraft assem-
bly clean rooms  [53] to hospital intensive care units 
(ICUs) [54]. Additionally, our study highlighted the recip-
rocal influence between E.  bugandensis and Klebsiella 
species, suggesting a potential reduction in the growth 
rate for Klebsiella (Fig. 6B). A recent study indicated the 
interaction between Enterobacter species and clinical 
isolates of K. pneumoniae and their implications for anti-
biotic resistance patterns [55]. This study also illustrated 
how the presence of E.  bugandensis influences Gram-
positive organisms (Fig.  6B). Nevertheless, while our 
metabolic modelling approach predicts antagonistic and 
parasitic behaviours, further experimentation is required 
to validate these predictions against other opportunistic 
microbial pathogens.
Conclusion
In this study, we presented a robust and comprehensive 
methodology to decipher the survival mechanisms of 
the clinically significant microorganism, E. bugandensis, 
within the challenging environment of the ISS. Through 
a synergistic integration of genomics, metagenomics, and 
metabolic modelling, we unravelled the potential strat-
egies employed by E.  bugandensis for adaptation and

persistence in the unique ISS ecosystem. Our approach 
holds promise for broader applications, especially in ter-
restrial controlled settings such as hospital ICUs and 
surgical theatres. Ultimately, our findings pave the way 
for a deeper understanding of microbial dynamics in 
extreme environments, laying a solid foundation for 
future hypotheses and expanding the horizons of micro-
bial ecology research.
Methods
Collection and classification of E. bugandensis genomes
In this study, we utilised publicly available annotated 
genomes of E. bugandensis (NCBI taxonomic ID 881260) 
from the NCBI GenBank sequence database (https://​
www.​ncbi.​nlm.​nih.​gov/​genba​nk/, accessed on July 17, 
2023) using command line tools NCBI Entrez Direct 
(EDirect) and bit  [56]. We downloaded 211 genomes, 
including 12 genomes of ISS strains and one MAG gener-
ated from the metagenome during the Microbial Track-
ing-1 mission. To identify the source of these isolates, we 
manually explored the NCBI BioSample database and 
classified them into four consistent categories—Human, 
Non-human/ Environmental, ISS, and Unknown isolates. 
To ensure taxonomic identification and relatedness of the 
genomes, we employed the FastANI v.1.33 tool to cal-
culate pairwise ANI for each downloaded genome [57]. 
The reference strain used for ANI calculation was the 
E. bugandensis type-strain EB-247T (NCBI assembly ID 
GCF_900324475.1, available at https://​www.​ncbi.​nlm.​
nih.​gov/​biosa​mple/​SAMEA​10471​1314/), 
which 
was 
originally isolated from the neonatal blood of a patient in 
Tanzania [14].
Phylogeny and SNP identification
We used the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based com-
mand-line tool, GToTree v.1.6.31  [58], to construct the 
phylogenetic tree of the E.  bugandensis genomes. The 
tree was built at strain level using the single-copy gene 
(SCG)-set HMM of Gammaproteobacteria targeting 
172 marker genes. We subsequently employed interac-
tive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v.6.7 [59] for visualisation and 
annotation of the tree. We excluded strain e1342 (NCBI 
assembly ID GCF_900075565.1) from our further analy-
ses, as it appeared as an outlier in the phylogenetic tree.
For the ISS strains and its close Earth-bound isolates (as 
shown in Fig. 2, we computed the SNPs through a core-
SNP set using Snippy v.4.6.0 (https://​github.​com/​tseem​
ann/​snippy) by mapping assembled contigs to annotated 
type-strain. Snippy uses Burrows-Wheelers Aligner and 
SAMtools v.1.3.1 for alignment and FreeBayes to iden-
tify variants across the provided genomes. We further 
ran Gubbins v.3.2.1 for recombination-removal and Fast-
Tree v.2.1.11 with the generalised time-reversible (GTR) 
model for tree-building on the output from Snippy to 
produce the phylogenetic tree shown in Supplementary 
Fig. 1A.
Identifying ISS‑associated genomic features 
of E. bugandensis
To identify and annotate the ORFs in the genomes 
of E.  bugandensis, we utilised Prokka v.1.14.6, which 
employs Prodigal for gene prediction  [60]. Prokka’s 
standard automated pipeline annotated the genomes 
based on multiple reference databases. We employed 
the Python package cogclassifier v.1.0.5 (https://​pypi.​
org/​proje​ct/​cogcl​assif​ier/) to identify and classify COGs 
(Clusters of Orthologous Genes) from the Prokka anno-
tated genomes. We applied the graph-based algorithm 
Panaroo v.1.3.2 in strict mode, employing specific param-
eters (including a sequence identity threshold of 0.7, a 
core genome sample threshold of 0.95, no paralog split-
ting, and the “Clustal” aligner) and constructed a pan-
genome  [61]. Subsequently, we used IQTREE v.2.2.27 
on the Panaroo core alignment output, with the GTR+G 
model in fast mode, to build an alternative phylogenetic 
tree [62]. For gene-level genome-wide association analy-
sis, we employed Scoary v.1.6.16, using the gene pres-
ence-absence matrix generated by Panaroo  [63]. This 
analysis enabled us to identify associations between all 
genes in the accessory genome and the traits of interest.
To identify the presence of antibiotic resistance genes 
and markers in the isolated genomes and MAGs of 
E. bugandensis from the ISS, we employed the Resistance 
Gene Identifier (RGI) v.6.0.2, a command line tool using 
the CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Data-
base) v.3.2.6  [22]. Matches were restricted to “Perfect” 
and “Strict” matches only, ensuring high confidence in 
the identified antibiotic resistance genes and markers.
Presence of E. bugandensis and co‑existing species in ISS 
metagenomic samples
We downloaded the 42 paired-end metagenomics reads 
of the environmental samples from ISS during the MT-1 
mission from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with 
the project accession PRJNA438545  [19]. The metadata 
for all the samples, including the run ID, sample size, 
and sample name, is available in Supplementary Table 2. 
We used the MetaSUB Core Analysis Modular Pipeline 
(CAMP) (https://​github.​com/​MetaS​UB-​CAMP) to pre-
process the samples and predict the taxonomic profiles 
of the metagenomic samples. Within the CAMP pipe-
line, the quality of the reads was assessed using FastQC 
v.0.12.0, following which low-quality reads were filtered 
out using fastp v.0.22.0 and adapter sequences were 
removed using AdapterRemoval v.2.3.3. Subsequently, 
host reads were removed after aligning it to the human 

Page 14 of 17
Sengupta et al. Microbiome           (2024) 12:62 
genome (GRCh38, without alternate contigs) using Bow-
tie2 v.2.4.5. Sequencing errors were corrected using Tad-
pole v.8.22.
We further employed the CAMP short-read taxonomy 
pipeline to generate taxonomical classification and rela-
tive abundance data for all metagenomic samples with 
non-human reads. The pipeline uses BBMask within 
BBMap v.35.85 to mask the metagenomes to prevent false 
positives in low-complexity or highly conserved regions 
in bacterial genomes. We then ran Kraken2 v.2.1.2, with a 
read length cut-off of 150, to classify reads and determine 
the closest matching species. We used Bracken v.2.7 on 
the output of Kraken2 to estimate the relative abundance 
of species in each sample.
Reconstruction of genome‑scale metabolic models
To gain insights into the microbial interactions of 
E.  bugandensis in the ISS, our primary focus was on 
identifying the viable microbiome associated with this 
bacterium. To achieve this, we analysed samples treated 
exclusively with propidium monoazide (PMA), which 
retains only viable and intact cells. For our analysis, we 
specifically considered only those samples containing 
E.  bugandensis. Additionally, we limited our study to 
bacteria that coexist with E. bugandensis, having a rela-
tive abundance of > 1% among all bacteria present at the 
respective location.
We obtained representative genome sequences of the 
co-existing bacteria from the GenBank sequence data-
base. To construct the Genome-scale metabolic models 
(GSMMs), these genomes were processed through KBase 
(https://​www.​kbase.​us/). The bacterial genomes were 
initially annotated using the RASTtk toolkit v1.073 [64]. 
Subsequently, the Build Metabolic Model v.2.0.0 app 
was used to reconstruct the models based on the Mod-
elSEED pipeline  [65]. Appropriate templates, such as 
Gram-positive or Gram-negative, were selected for the 
reconstruction process. We further gap-filled the models 
using RefGlucoseMinimal medium from the KBase pub-
lic media database, with a maximum uptake of Glucose 
to 10 mmol/gDW-h. These resulting models were then 
utilised for both graph-theoretic and constraint-based 
analyses.
Exploring the metabolic interactions of E. bugandensis 
in ISS
We simulated genome-scale models using a compre-
hensive set of metabolites believed to be necessary for 
the growth of the microbial community aboard the ISS. 
This metabolite set combines the minimal medium of 
each metabolic model with essential cofactors and coen-
zymes, as reported previously  [13]. To determine the 
minimal media for microbial communities, we employed 
the minimal_media_from_cobrapy function from 
MetQuest v.2.0, which ensures the necessary compo-
nents for a minimum growth rate of 0.1 h −1 of all mem-
bers in the community [66].
We further used MetQuest v.2.0 for constructing bipar-
tite graphs that represent the metabolic framework of 
microorganisms. These graphs represent the interplay 
of reactions within the microbial community and helped 
us identify active and stuck reactions for the given set of 
metabolites using a guided breadth-first search approach. 
The extent of metabolic benefit for each pair in the com-
munity was measured using the Metabolic Support Index 
(MSI) according to the following equation:
Here, nstuckA and nstuckA|AB are the numbers of stuck 
reactions in the wild-type and pair-wise community 
structures. The metabolic dependencies were quanti-
fied based on the number of stuck reactions that were 
relieved by the developed community networks.
To predict the nature of microbial interactions, we 
employed SteadyCom, an optimisation framework for 
rapid linear programming problem-solving. This frame-
work allowed us to estimate the biomass production rates 
of every microbial member in the community in a time-
averaged, steady-state manner [24]. The pairwise effect of 
microbes in any given community was expressed through 
the equation:
Here, vbio,B and vbio,AB are the biomass production rate 
of the organism B (wild-type) and the community (AB), 
respectively. For SteadyCom simulation, the same media 
as before was used, with a constrained uptake rate of −10 
mmol/gDW-h. We considered a significant change in 
growth when there was a 10% difference in the growth 
rate of an organism within the community compared to 
its individual growth rate. Based on the calculated values 
from the equation (i.e. the effect of A on B and the effect 
of B on A), we classified microbial interactions into six 
broad types: mutualism (+,+), parasitism (+,−), com-
mensalism (+,0 or 0,+), amensalism (−,0 or 0,−), compe-
tition (−,−), and neutral (0,0).
