Abstract 
During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, 
several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appear-
ance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel 
strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions 
using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB and TEF1), 
and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclu-
sion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T, isolated 
from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidi-
ales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast 
strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T, isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed 
in the genus Cystobasidium (Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we 
propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 
115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses 
revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were 
more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated 
with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotoler-
ance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed 
to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel 
species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, includ-
ing yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.

INTRODUCTION
Many fungal species, including yeasts, have been isolated 
and characterized from different extreme environments, 
such as the Antarctic continent (rocks, soil brines), Arctic 
ice-sheet and sea-ice, deep sea, deserts, etc. (Buzzini and 
Margesin 2014; Segal-Kischinevzky et  al. 2022; Coleine 
et al. 2022). Yeasts and yeast-like fungi isolated from Ant-
arctic environments (proposed as resembling the surface 
and conditions of Mars and/or Icy Moons) were reported 
to successfully resist a wide spectrum of stressors which 
mimic conditions on other planetary bodies, including 
ionizing radiation, UV-flux irradiation, extremely low 
and high temperatures, desiccation, high salinity and 
acidic conditions (Onofri et  al. 2004, 2020; Selbmann 
et al. 2005; Pacelli et al. 2017, 2021; Buzzini et al. 2018). 
Since National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion (NASA) Planetary Protection (PP) seeks to prevent 
anthropogenic microbial transport (forward contamina-
tion) to other planets (Cockell 2005; Conley and Rummel 
2010), evaluation of hitchhiking extremophilic yeasts on 
spacecraft and associated components is necessary.
A wide range of microbial taxa, including both bacterial 
and fungal species, have been detected in various NASA 
spacecraft assembly cleanrooms (La Duc et al. 2012), but 
historically NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) 
PP policy has focused on monitoring and eradicating 
bacteria, specifically those producing endospores. How-
ever, the presence of fungi in these cleanrooms has also 
recently been assessed, since fungi are tolerant of a wide 
range of extreme conditions (Parker et al. 2022; Blacho-
wicz et al. 2022; Chander et al. 2022b). Characterization 
of fungi (including yeast) is important both for assessing 
the risk of forward contamination and updating appro-
priate cleaning and sterilization strategies (Benardini 
and Moissl-Eichinger 2022). Therefore, newly discovered 
fungal (including yeasts) species in cleanrooms must be 
evaluated not only for their morphology, but also at the 
genomic level so that new countermeasures can be devel-
oped to eradicate them based on their biology and resil-
ient properties (Chander et al. 2022b).
To date, only filamentous fungi have been described 
from cleanrooms (Parker et  al. 2022; Blachowicz et  al. 
2022; Chander et  al. 2022b). In contrast to filamentous 
fungi, yeasts are microscopic and predominantly unicel-
lular (Boekhout et al. 2021). It has been shown that yeast 
and yeast-like fungi are capable of adapting to and colo-
nizing various ecological niches due to their genetic and 
phenotypic plasticity and robustness (Ene et  al. 2015; 
Ribeiro et al. 2022). Several important adaptations facili-
tate survival of yeast cells in harsh environments, includ-
ing production of thick external polysaccharide capsules, 
forming biofilm, and UV protective compounds, melanin, 
carotenoids and mycosporines (Buzzini et  al. 2018). In 
this study, we describe for the first time two novel yeast 
species from NASA cleanrooms, which are oligotrophic 
extreme environments.
To explore yeast diversity in various environments 
including NASA cleanrooms, understanding their phy-
logenetic diversity and ecology is necessary. Phylogenies 
based on 16S ribosomal RNA or average nucleotide iden-
tity (ANI) are most commonly used for prokaryote tax-
onomy, but fungal species are identified with nucleotide 
sequences of multiple conserved gene regions (Lücking 
et  al. 2021). To identify yeasts, both phenotypic traits 
and molecular analyses are required (Boekhout et  al. 
2021). The modern yeast taxonomy includes genealogi-
cal approaches based on single locus (ITS or LSU), multi-
locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and recently whole 
genome sequencing (WGS) (Libkind et  al. 2020; Boek-
hout et al. 2021; Chander et al. 2022b). Molecular phy-
logeny for species recognition in Fungi is gaining broad 
attention (Lücking et al. 2021), but understanding species 
ecology requires investigating morphology, physiology, 
and biochemistry leading to the Consolidated Species 
Concept based on the so-called polyphasic approach 
(Boekhout et al. 2021).
One of the objectives of this study was to characterize 
two novel yeast species by employing the polyphasic tax-
onomic approach, which is necessary to formally describe 
the two novel taxa. Colony morphology, microscopic fea-
tures, and physiological properties were combined with 
MLSA phylogeny (seven loci). In addition, a phylogenetic 
analysis based on available WGS was applied to test its 
utility for species discrimination. The assembled and 
characterized genomes of Naganishia kalamii FJI-L2-BK-
P3T and Cystobasidium onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T were 
compared with genomes of other closely related species 
to identify unique and shared evolutionary characters. 
Considering unique properties of the habitat challenging 
the microbial life, the third objective of this study was to 
assess the UV-C resistance of the two novel yeast spe-
cies and compared with a UV-C resistant extremophilic 
yeast, Naganishia onofrii strain DBVPG 5303 from Miage 
glacier (Mont Blanc, Alps, Italy) at the altitude of 3892 m 
above sea level (Turchetti et al. 2015).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection and isolation of yeasts
Steps for sample collection and isolation of yeasts at the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility 
(JPL-SAF) and the Kennedy Space Center Payload Haz-
ardous and Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF) cleanrooms 
were previously described (Parker et  al. 2022; Blacho-
wicz et  al. 2022). Briefly, samples were collected from 

Page 3 of 21

cleanroom surfaces using moist polyester wipes and 
were agitated in 200 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS) and shaken for 1 min. The resulting PBS suspen-
sion was concentrated using an Innova Prep LLC concen-
trating pipette and spread onto plates containing potato 
dextrose agar (PDA, Difco, #213,400) mixed with chlo-
ramphenicol (25 µg/mL). Plates were incubated at 25 °C 
for 7–14 days, and yeast strains were isolated, purified, 
and stored for further characterization.
Steps for determination of microscopic traits and 
observation and microscopic morphology were followed 
as per previous protocol (Chander et  al. 2022b). In a 
nutshell, a small block of agar was placed in the center 
of a sterile slide, and all four sides of the agar were 
inoculated with the yeast suspension. Subsequently, a 
sterile cover slip was gently placed on top of the agar 
block. The slide culture was kept in a moist Petri dish 
lined with filter paper soaked in sterile water. After 
14–21 days, the yeast grew out onto the coverslip and 
the slide was tested. The cover slip was gently removed 
with sterile forceps and placed on a clean microscopic 
slide with a drop of water or lactophenol cotton blue 
(Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) for microscopic 
observations. Phase contrast images were captured on 
an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 
camera and Olympus cellSens software. Differential 
interference contrast (DIC) images were generated on a 
Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope with Nikon NIS Ele-
ments software. Cell morphological characters were 
measured with the Olympus cellSens or Nikon NIS Ele-
ments software.
Assimilation tests were performed in liquid media fol-
lowing the procedures described by (Kurtzman et  al. 
2011), in custom-made microplates (Nunc 96-Well 
U-Bottom plate, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 5  mL 
tubes (Falcon, Corning) using the same standard set 
of substrates and with YT MicroPlates (BioLog) as 
described elsewhere (Greetham et  al. 2014; Mašínová 
et  al. 2018; Passer et  al. 2019). Tubes and microplates 
with suitable aliquots of test cultures were incubated at 
25  °C. Utilization of substrates was examined in PDA 
and incubated for 7 days. The change in coloration and 
oxidation and/or assimilation profiles of 94 different car-
bon sources were documented by visual examination. 
The clear positives and negatives were scored within 
7  days of incubation, and delayed reaction (weak) was 
documented by examining the tetrazolium violet color 
change after 14  days of incubation. Further incubation 
and observation on 14th day did not yield any difference 
in results compared to those that were observed at day 
7. Tubes were examined after 7, 14 and 21 days, and the 
growth (changing turbidity) was documented by visual 
examination.
Preliminary identification based on ITS sequencing
DNA was extracted from 7-day grown yeast cultures on 
PDA incubated at 25  °C using the tissue LEV purifica-
tion kit with Maxwell-16 MDx automated system (Pro-
mega, Madison, WI, USA). The ITS region was amplified 
employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using prim-
ers ITS 1F (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA 
A-3′) (Lai et  al. 2007), and Tw13 (5′-GGT CCG TGT 
TTC AAG ACG-3′) (Taylor and Bruns 1999). PCR con-
ditions and sample preparation steps for sequencing are 
described elsewhere (Blachowicz et  al. 2017). The ITS 
sequences were also included in the subsequent MLSA-
based analyses.
Whole genome sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated from 1  g wet biomass 
scraped from PDA plates, using a ZymoBIOMICS Mag-
Bead DNA kit (Zymo Research) and bead beating, fol-
lowed by a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin) treatment. The 
quality of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophore-
sis and quantified by spectrophotometric measurements 
(Nanophotometer NP80 Mobile, Implen GmbH). Library 
preparation was performed using the Illumina Nextera 
Flex Protocol (Illumina document # 1000000025416 v07). 
The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was 
quantified, and 5–12 cycles of PCR amplification were 
carried out to normalize the output depending on the 
input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA 
fragments were indexed and pooled in a 384-plex con-
figuration with dual-index adapters. WGS was performed 
on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 base pairs (bp) 
platform with a paired-end module. The data was filtered 
with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain 2012), for high-
quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome 
assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality 
score, 20). The genomes for the two novel yeast species 
were reassembled using the Automatic Assembly For The 
Fungi (AAFTF v 0.3.3) pipeline (Stajich and Palmer 2019), 
as follows: (i)The Illumina sequencing reads underwent 
trimming via the BBDuk module within the BBMap soft-
ware suite (v 38.95) (BBMap: A Fast, Accurate, Splice-
Aware Aligner (Conference) OSTI.GOV); (ii) BBMap was 
employed to eliminate any contaminant reads, and (iii) 
the resulting high-quality reads were assembled using 
SPAdes v3.15.4 (Bankevich et al. 2012). (iv) Contaminant 
contigs were identified and removed, using nucleotide 
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) (Johnson 
et al. 2008); (v) We purged duplicated contigs using mini-
map2 (Li 2018). Final assemblies were polished, using 
the Pilon v1.24 software (Walker et  al. 2014); (vii) The 
final scaffolds were sorted by length and the fasta head-
ers renamed for further annotation. The assembly qual-
ity was verified with QUAST 5.1.0 (Gurevich et al. 2013)

and completeness using BUSCO and its basidiomycota_
odb10 database (Seppey et al. 2019).
Genome annotation and comparative genomic analyses
As described in Chander et al. (2022b), the funannotate 
v1.8 pipeline (Palmer and Stajich 2020) for fungal genome 
annotation was used. Masked repetitive DNA content 
were identified using TANTAN (Frith 2011) using the 
funannotate mask command. The funnanotate predict 
command was used for gene content prediction, via both 
evidence-based and ab  initio (i.e. structure-based) pre-
diction pathways. The basidiomycota_odb10 BUSCO 
database (Simão et al. 2015) was used to find conserved 
gene models for training the ab initio predictors Augus-
tus (Seppey et  al. 2019), glimmerhmm (Delcher 1999), 
and snap (Korf 2004). The GeneMark-ES was also evoked 
with the option for fungal genomes (Lomsadze 2005). 
Weighted consensus gene structure was obtained via 
EVidenceModeler (Haas et  al. 2008) using weigh = 2 in 
the case of Augustus HiQ models and weight = 1 oth-
erwise. Genes of length < 50aa and genes identified as 
transposable elements were filtered out of the dataset. 
tRNAscan-SE was used to predict tRNAs (Chan and 
Lowe 2019). Finally, the funannotate annotate function 
was used to annotate genes using Eggnog (Huerta-Cepas 
et  al. 2019), Pfam (Mistry et  al. 2021), carbohydrate-
degrading enzymes (CAZYme) (Drula et al. 2022), Inter-
proscan (Blum et al. 2021), Gene Ontology (GO) terms 
(Gene Ontology Consortium 2004), MEROPS (Rawlings 
et al. 2018), and Secreted proteins (Choi et al. 2010). Bio-
synthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were predicted in the two 
yeast genomes via fungiSMASH, the fungal-genome-
specific version of antiSMASH (Blin et al. 2021). We next 
run the funannotate compare function in 7 Naganishia 
species (which ones) and in 5 Cystobasidium (which 
ones), to look for genomic trends of the above protein 
categories in those two groups of fungi. Next, we ran 
CAFE5 to infer changes in the size of Interpro gene fami-
lies regarding their phylogenetic distribution using the 
gene birth and death procedure to infer gene gain and 
loss of specific yeast phenotypes. Assembled genomes 
and its respectively annotations were deposited at the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; 
Chander et al. 2022a).
Multi‑locus phylogenetic analyses
Following recent multi-gene analyses of basidiomycet-
ous yeasts (Liu et  al. 2015; Wang et  al. 2015b), MLSA 
was used to obtain solid placement of the two yeast 
strains. The gene sequences of all available Naganishia 
strains were retrieved from NCBI, except for N. tulchin-
skyi (Bijlani et  al. 2022) and FJI-L2-BK-P3T strains, 
which were obtained from using blast tools (Additional 
file 1: Table S1). Likewise, the gene sequence of all avail-
able Cystobasidium strains were retrieved from NCBI, 
except for the FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T strain, which was 
obtained from its WGS during this study (Additional 
file 1: Table S2). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out 
using seven genes (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB, 
and TEF1) with all available Naganishia (n = 20) and 
Cystobasidium species (n = 21). The individual gene 
sequences for Cystobasidium and Naganishia datasets 
were aligned separately using the R package DECIPHER 
(Wright 2020). Briefly, sequences from a fasta file were 
extracted and loaded using ReadDNAStringSet function. 
The removeGaps argument was set to "all" to remove 
all gaps in the input sequences. For this reason, Orient-
Nucleotides function was used to reorient sequences by 
changing their directionality and/or complementarity 
to match specified reference sequences in the same set. 
By default, the first sequence with maximum width was 
used as a reference sequence. Character string indicat-
ing the allowed reorientation of non-reference sequences 
was set to "both" (for reverse complement). The algo-
rithm works by finding the k-mer distance between the 
reference sequence. The more the sequences look similar, 
smaller is the evolutionary distance. Numeric threshold 
giving the decrease in k-mer distance required to adopt 
the alternative orientation was set to 0.05. AlignSeqs 
function was performed for the generation of the align-
ment. The profile-to-profile method aligns a sequence set 
by merging profiles along a guide tree until all the input 
sequences are aligned. Guide tree was automatically con-
structed based on a distance matrix of shared k-mers 
using the setting guideTree = NULL. iterations = 2 and 
refinement = 1 were set to specify the number of iteration 
steps to regenerate the guide tree based and the re-align-
ment. Thus, the best alignment was chosen based on its 
sum-of-pairs score. Construction of phylogenetic trees 
utilizing the seven gene sequences listed above for MLSA 
was performed via IQ-TREE v 2.1.1 using the concatena-
tion approach (Minh et al. 2020). ModelFinder approach 
was used for the evaluation of the best DNA substitu-
tion model (Kalyaanamoorthy et  al. 2017). Ultrafast 
bootstraps and SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test 
(SH-aLRT) were assumed for branch support (Anisimova 
et al. 2011). The tree topologies were then visualized with 
the Interactive Tree Of Life v5 (https://​itol.​embl.​de/).
Whole genome‑based phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenomic trees based on universal barcodes for fungi 
were constructed following the PHYling pipeline (GitHub 
- stajichlab/PHYling_unified: Unified PHYling pipe-
line for species tree building from annotated genomes; 
see https://​github.​com/​staji​chlab/​AAFTF and https://​
github.​com/​nextg​enusfs/​funan​notate for assembly and

annotation steps). The protein models representing the 
Tremellomycetes class (for phylogenomic analysis of FJI-
L2-BK-P3T) and the Cystobasidiales order (for phylog-
enomic analysis of FJI-L2-BK-P3T) were downloaded 
from the Mycocosm portal (Grigoriev et al. 2014). Addi-
tional unannotated genomes representing the Cystoba-
sidium and Naganishia species were downloaded from 
NCBI and submitted to the same gene prediction papiline 
described above (See Genome Annotation and Compara-
tive Genomic Analyses section). We used the hmmsearch 
tool from HMMER v3.3.2, to compare protein sequences 
to the fungi_odb10 database, a collection of benchmark-
ing protein sequences that are conserved across a wide 
range of fungal species, and identify potential homolo-
gous sequences (Simão et al. 2015). The tool utilizes a sta-
tistical model of protein sequence conservation to identify 
the degree of similarity between the query sequence and 
the protein sequences contained in the database. To cre-
ate the protein alignments, the HMMER v3.3.2 hmmbuild 
function was employed. Spurious positions were purged 
with the ClipKIT v 1.3.0 tool, using the smartgap func-
tion. We then generated individual protein Maximum 
Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees employing IQ-TREE2 
using partitions from each protein marker; the best pro-
tein model was calculated individually utilizing standard 
model selection (-m TEST option) (Kalyaanamoorthy 
et  al. 2017). Tree reconstruction was performed with 
the supermatrix approach (Chernomor et  al. 2016) and 
branch fidelity was tested using SH-aLRT (Anisimova and 
Gascuel 2006) and ultrafast bootstrap methods (Hoang 
et al. 2018). The final tree for each species was visualized 
with FigTree v 1.4.4 software.
UV‑C resistance
The evaluation of UV-C resistance was carried out via 
methods described previously (Blachowicz et  al. 2019). 
Briefly, yeast cells (n = 3 species) were counted using a 
hemocytometer (Double Neubauer Counting Chamber, 
Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA, United States) from 
7-day-old cultures grown at 25  °C on PDA. Cell sus-
pensions were diluted in molecular grade sterile water 
(Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and 
∼ 2 × ­104 cells/mL were added to precision-cleaned alu-
minum coupons followed by drying overnight at room 
temperature in a bio-hood (Chander et  al. 2022a, b). 
Coupons with dried yeast cells were placed in plastic 
Petri dishes, without a lid, and exposed to UV-C using 
a Crosslinker CL-1000 (UVP Inc). The lamp was placed 
above the sample with an exposure time required to pro-
duce the following doses: 0, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 J/
m2. The dose rate was 100 μW ­cm−2. After exposure to 
UV-C, 100 μL of 10% sterile polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was 
applied on each coupon and dried at 37 °C for 60 min. 
Dried PVA along with yeast cells was peeled using ster-
ile forceps and added to 1 mL of molecular grade sterile 
water. The PVA extraction step was repeated twice. Once 
PVA was dissolved, serial dilutions were prepared and 
plated on PDA in quadruplicates. Colony forming units 
(CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation at 25 °C.
TAXONOMY
Naganishia kalamii K. Venkateswaran, P. Leo & N. K. 
Singh, sp. nov.
MycoBank: MB 846830.
Etymology: After Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, 
an Indian aerospace scientist in whose honor the species 
is named.
Diagnosis: N. kalamii can be readily differentiated 
from its phylogenetically closest relative N. albida by 
the growth at 30 °C and 35 °C, whereas N. albida did not 
exhibit growth at temperatures higher than 25 °C. Since 
N. kalamii assimilate imidazole and exhibited growth at 
10% NaCl, these tests can be used to differentiate N. kal-
amii from other member of the N. albida clade.

RESULTS
Naganishia kalamii
Molecular phylogeny
Naganishia kalamii belongs to Basidiomycota, class 
Tremellomycetes, and order Filobasidiales. ITS sequence 
similarity of the strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T with the majority 
of Naganishia species was > 98.5% suggesting that the ITS 
marker alone may not be useful to identify Naganishia 
species (see also Scorzetti et al. 2002; Fonseca et al. 2011). 
Furthermore, combined sequence analyses of both ITS 
and LSU fragments placed N. kalamii in the N. albida 
clade, in a distinct position next to N. albida var. ovalis 
CBS ­5810T (two substitutions in the LSU). Although the 
N. albida clade is represented in the literature, collec-
tions and databases by an array of strains showing highly 
variable physiological and biochemical characteristics, 
the pair-wise distances matrix clearly shows the diffi-
culties to discriminate the members of N. albida clade 
when only ITS and LSU markers were used (Additional 
file 2: Fig. S2). This problem was highlighted in the com-
ments to the species by Fonseca et al. (2011), but in 2021 
two Naganishia species were described largely based 
on sequence dissimilarity in the clade (Kachalkin et  al. 
2019; Tan et al. 2021). However, it is important to note 
that the analyzed protein-coding (CYTB, TEF1, RPB1 
and RPB2) individual phylogenetic trees of gene frag-
ments other than SSU (invariable for the whole clade), 
LSU and ITS exhibited higher resolution in differentiat-
ing the Naganishia species (Additional file 2: Fig. S3–S7). 
Furthermore, seven-loci phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2a) con-
vincingly showed that FJI-L2-BK-P3T occupies a distinct 
position in the clade with high bootstrap support (100%). 
The novel species N. kalamii is most closely related to 
N. albida var. ovalis CBS ­5810T, N. albida var. kuetzingii 
CBS ­1926T (type of Cryptococcus kuetzingii), N. albida 
var. albida CBS ­142T, N. liquefaciens CBS ­968T and N. 
adeliensis CBS ­8351T (Fig. 2a). Another species N. nivalis 
was not included in the MLSA-analysis because protein-
coding sequences were not available for the analysis. The 
tree based on conserved genes from the N. kalamii FJI-
L2-BK-P3T genome (Fig.  2b) showed that N. kalamii is 
phylogenetically distinct from N. albida var. albida CBS 
­142T and Naganishia sp. NRRL Y-1402 that was earlier 
misidentified as N. albida var. albida.
Genomic characteristics of N. kalamii FJI‑L2‑BK‑P3T 
and comparative genomic analysis
The estimated genome size of N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-
P3T is 27.86  Mb and assembled into 478 scaffolds 
(N50 = 190,774, L50 = 38) with a largest scaffold as 
1,000,601  bp. The GC content is 53.9% and the raw 
sequences are submitted with an accession #: JAK-
LLX000000000. A total of 8,085 genes were identified, 
divided into 7902 mRNAs and 183 tRNAs. We have 
found 1,904 GO annotated and 6007 Eggnog terms, 
2548 Interpro and 4783 Pfam domains, 177 CAZYmes, 
219 MEROPS peptidases, 396 secreted proteins, and 
1624 BUSCO orthologs. When compared with other 
Naganishia species, N. kalamii has the highest number 
of genes (8085) and 7902 proteins products (Additional 
file 1: Table S4). Among the seven species of Naganishia 
analyzed, three species belonging to the N. albida clade 
(N. kalamii, N. albida JCM 2334 and NRRL Y-1402) had 
similar number of predicted genes and proteins, of which 
N. kalamii exhibited the highest number of secreted pro-
teins (Additional file  2: Fig. S8) as well the number of 
peptidases (MEROPS; Additional file 2: Fig. S9) but not 
CAZymes (Fig.  3). Lowest numbers of CAZymes terms 
were seen in Naganishia sp. N6 (168; deep sea isolate) 
and N. vishniacii ANT03-052 (170; Antarctic soil isolate), 
that were isolated from natural extreme environments.

Based on the detailed research in the MEROPS pep-
tide database, 219 different membrane associated pepti-
dases were identified within the families: aspartic (10), 
cycteine (52), metallo (76), serine (62), threonine (17) and 
protease inhibitors (2). Serine peptidase, S9 prolyl oligo-
peptidase (S09X subfamily), and the prolyl aminopepti-
dases (S33) were the most abundant families detected in 
the Naganishia species. Moreover, the metallo protease 
thimet oligopeptidase (M03A), pitrilysin (M16A), amin-
opeptidase N (M01) and the serine protease d-Ala-d-Ala 
carboxypeptidase B (S12) were found to be overrepre-
sented in the genome of N. kalamii (Additional file 2: Fig. 
S9).
Detailed analysis into CAZy database revealed 49 
genes associated with assembly (GT: glycosyltrans-
ferase) and 109 (84 GH: glycoside hydrolase, 3 PL: 
polysaccharide lyase, 22 CE: carbohydrate esterase) 
involved in the breakdown of carbohydrate complexes 
(Fig.  3). In addition, 16 genes coding for initial lignin 
degradation (AA: auxiliary activities) and 5 involved 
in carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) were also pre-
dicted. According to genome-wide comparison, N. kal-
amii shared 59 CAZy families with other Naganishia 
species analyzed. No unique CAZy families have been 
recorded for N. kalamii. However, the polysaccha-
ride lyase family 36 (PL36) was shared only among the 
members of the N. albida clade. GH5 and CE10 were 
the largest family (both with 15 predicted genes in N. 
kalamii) shared also by the other Naganishia members. 
GH5 consisted of genes related to cellulolytic activ-
ity while genes encoding CE10 family members act on 
non-carbohydrate substrates. Genes involved in the 
degradation of endogenous fungal cell wall polysaccha-
rides (GH128) and lignin (AA1) were also detected.
Since survival of yeasts on UV-C exposure was per-
formed during this study, Pfam and Interpro terms 
associated with dehydration, desiccation, rehydration 
and UV resistance have been investigated (Additional 
file  2: Fig. S10). Results did not reveal significant dif-
ferences in Pfam terms among the Naganishia species 
analyzed. Protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase 
(PF07714), WD domain, G-beta repeat (PF00400), 
Ras family (PF00071), Cytochrome P450 (PF00067), 
Ankyrin repeats (PF12796) and ABC transporter 
(PF00005) were the most presented Pfam terms in 
all the species. Heat shock protein 70 and dehydra-
tion stress-response Pfam terms were also commonly 
present in all the species analyzed. The psychrophilic

N. vishniacii ANT03-052 showed presence of genes 
involved in raffinose synthesis (PF05691).
The Interpro analysis filtered for UV resistance terms 
for N. kalamii showed the absence of protein directly 
involved in the synthesis of carotenoids (IPR004294). 
N. kalamii also lack the UV radiation resistance protein 
(IPR018791), short coiled – coil protein (IPR019357), 
and the XPG conserved site (IPR019974) involved in the 
catalytic mechanism of DNA excision repair, but XPG, 
N-terminal (IPR006085) and XPG/Rad2 endonuclease 
(IPR006084) are present, both not conserved residues. 
The only strain exhibiting all the terms involved in the 
UV resistance was Antarctic N. vishniacii ANT03-052 
strain.
The profile of fungal-specific transcriptional factors 
was compared among the Naganishia species (Addi-
tional file  2: Fig. S11). Fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear 
cluster domain (IPR001138), fungal-specific TF domain 
(IPR007219), basic region leucine zipper 2 (IPR004827) 
and bZIP TF 1 (IPR004827) were commonly enriched in 
all the species considered. However, it was not prominent 
in N. kalamii when compared to the Antarctic strain N. 
vishniacii ANT03-052 and avian guano in South Africa 
strain N. randhawae eABCC1.
CAFE5 analysis revealed that N. kalamii has experi-
enced an expansion of 10 Interpro domain categories 
while a reduction of 43 Interpro domains (p < 0.05) 
was witnessed (Fig.  3a). The GO term conversion of 
the acquired Interpro domains are related to protein 
N-linked glycosylation and inositol phosphate dephos-
phorylation biological processes. In contrary, the 
contracted GO terms are related to regulation of DNA-
templated transcription, regulation of transcription by 
RNA polymerase II, protein folding, proteolysis, ubiq-
uitin-dependent protein catabolic process, intracellular 
protein transport and vesicle-mediated transport. This 
suggested that N. kalamii have lost domains related to 
the control of transcription as well as protein degrada-
tion, folding and transport.
Six biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were pre-
dicted in the genome of N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3T, five 
of which do not match with any known BGCs. These 
included three non-ribosomal peptide synthase-like 
(NRPS-like) clusters, one cluster encoding for a Type 
III polyketide synthase, and two clusters encoding for 
terpene synthesis, one of which was identified as the 
BGC for the synthesis of clavaric acid. Similar sets of 
BGCs were predicted for the genomes of Naganishia 
sp. strain N6 and N. albida JCM 2334, with two dif-
ferences: one, neither of the terpene synthesis clus-
ters were a match for clavaric acid in the genome of N. 
albida JCM 2334; and two, Naganishia sp. strain N6

was predicted to have a NRPS cluster in place of one of 
the three NRPS-like clusters (Fig. 4).
Cystobasidium onofrii
Phylogenetic placement
This novel yeast belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, 
class Cystobasidiomycetes, and order Cystobasidiales. 
According to the phylogenetic analysis based on ITS and 
LSU sequences, C. onofrii is distantly related to C. ben-
thicum JCM ­10901T (16 base substitutions and 6 gaps, 
97.01% of similarity in ITS and 5 base substitutions, 
99.22% in LSU). The similarity of C. onofrii with other 
Cystobasidium species are shown in Additional file  1: 
Table  S6 and the two ribosomal genetic markers were 
found to be good to discriminate Cystobasidium spe-
cies. The individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, 
SSU, CTYB, TEF1, RPB1, RPB2, (Additional file  2: Fig. 
S12–S18; Additional file 1: Table S6) were generated fol-
lowed by a concatenated seven-loci phylogenetic tree 
(Fig.  5a) for Cystobasidiales species. All the seven loci 
investigated exhibited good resolution in delimiting the 
analysed Cystobasidium species. Based on the MLSA 
tree, strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T constitutes a well-sup-
ported clade with C. benthicum, C. tubakii, and C. pal-
lidum, each of the species representing a well-separated 
lineage (Fig.  5a). The WGS-based analysis further sup-
ported a distinct phylogenetic position of the strain FKI-
L6-BK-PAB1T (Fig. 5b) and formed a triad along with C. 
tubakii 9A-1–0 and C. pallidum JCM 3780.
Genomic characteristics of C. onofrii FKI‑L6‑BK‑PAB1Tand

(N50 = 616,502, L50 = 10) with a largest scaffold as 
3,147,288  bp. The GC content is 48.8% and the raw 
sequences 
were 
submitted 
with 
an 
Accession#: 
JAKLNA000000000. The final annotation of the C. onofrii 
yielded a total of 6889 genes, divided into 6831 mRNAs 
and 58 tRNAs. The genome annotation revealed 2934 
GO and 5820 Eggnog terms, 3930 Interpro and 4803 
Pfam domains, 172 CAZYmes, 221 MEROPS peptidases, 
335 secreted proteins, and 1540 BUSCO orthologs.
Comparative genome analyses of Cystobasidium spe-
cies showed that C. onofrii has the second highest num-
ber of genes (6889) and predicted protein products 
(6831) after C. slooffiae (Additional file 1: Table S7). The 
genomic annotations revealed that C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-
PAB1T secreted larger number of proteins and second to 
C. slooffiae among the Cystobasidium species (Additional 
file 2: Fig. S19). Similar trend is observed for the number 
of secreted proteins that are peptidases (Additional file 2: 
Fig. S20), CAZymes (Fig. 6), and MEROPS classes. How-
ever, no significant changes in the number of each group 
have been observed. Among the CAZymes of C. onofrii, 
30 genes associated with assembly of glycosyltransferase 
(GT) and 87 genes involved in the breakdown of carbo-
hydrate complexes (52 GH: glycoside hydrolase, 5 PL: 
polysaccharide lyase, 30 CE: carbohydrate esterase) were 
predicted. In addition, 20 genes coding for initial lignin 
degradation (AA: auxiliary activities) and 1 involved in 
carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) were also noticed. 
According to genome-wide comparison, C. onofrii shared 
52 CAZy families with the other 4 Cystobasidium spe-
cies while PL Family 36 (PL36) was unique in C. onofrii 
(Fig. 6). GH5 and CE10 were the largest family (both with 
16 predicted genes in C. onofrii) shared also by the other 
Cystobasidium members. GH5 presents genes related to 
the degradation of cellulose while genes encoding CE10 
family members act on non-carbohydrate substrates. CE 
family 16 is another family well represented in C. onofrii 
along with C. tubakii and C. slooffiae.
Since C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T strain could uti-
lize several organic substrates, a search in the MEROPS 
peptide database was performed in order to survey the 
genome for membrane associated peptidases that could 
initiate the degradation of complex protein molecules. 
In total, 221 different peptidases were identified, which 
were classified within the families: aspartic (13), cycteine 
(48), metallo (68), serine (76), threonine (19), protease 
inhibitors (2) and mixed peptidase (1). Serine and met-
allo peptidase are the predominant families in all the Cys-
tobasidium species. In C. onofrii S9 prolyl oligopeptidase 
(S09X subfamily) and the prolyl aminopeptidases (S33) 
are the more abundant terms. S33 includes some hydro-
lases, which additionally degrade other substrates like 
lipids. The exo-keratinolytic enzymes M38 and the A01A 
subfamily members, are found abundantly in C. onofrii 
compare to the other Cystobasidium species (Additional 
file 2: Fig. S20).

Pfam and Interpro terms associated with dehydra-
tion, desiccation, rehydration and UV resistance have 
been investigated as stress parameters (Additional file 2: 
Fig. S21). Results did not reveal significant differences 
in Pfam terms among the Cystobasidium analyzed. Pro-
tein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase (PF07714), WD 
domain, G-beta repeat (PF00400), Ras family (PF00071), 
Cytochrome P450 (PF00067), Ankyrin repeats (3 copies) 
(PF12796) and ABC transporter (PF00005) are the most 
presented Pfam terms in all the species.
Heat shock protein 70 and other Pfam terms for pre-
dicted proteins involved in the dehydration stress-response 
are also commonly present in all the Cystobasidium species 
analyzed. The Interpro analysis filtered for UV resistance 
terms, seen in the genome of C. onofrii of proteins related 
to the synthesis of carotenoids (IPR004294; IPR002060) 
and DNA-repair (eg. IPR006084). However, C. onofrii lacks 
the UV radiation resistance protein (IPR018791) and short 
coiled protein (IPR019357) but both of these proteins are 
present in the genome of the Antarctic C. ongulense and in 
C. slooffiae (Additional file 2: Fig. S21).
Fungal-specific transcriptional factors among the 
Cystobasidium species (Additional file  2: Fig. S22) 
showed presence of Fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear 
cluster 
domain 
(IPR001138), 
Fungal-specific 
TF 
domain (IPR007219), Basic region leucine zipper 2 
(IPR004827), and bZIP TF 1 (IPR004827) and are more 
prominent in C. onofrii (Additional file  2: Fig. S22), 
when compared with the strains isolated from natural 
extreme environments (Antarctic soil and deep sea).
Data from CAFE analysis of Cystobasidium species 
showed that C. onofrii has experienced an expansion 
of 31 Interpro domain categories while a reduction of 
9 Interpro domains (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6a). The expansions 
were related to acetyl-CoA biosynthetic process from 
pyruvate, DNA repair, regulation of DNA-templated 
transcription, protein phosphorylation, nitrogen com-
pound metabolic process, mono-atomic ion transport, 
phospholipid biosynthetic process, iron ion transmem-
brane transport, and positive regulation of transcrip-
tion by RNA polymerase II. In contrary, the contracted 
GO terms were related to DNA repair, sulfate trans-
port, and transmembrane transport.
A single BGC, an NRPS-like cluster of unknown 
function, was predicted in the genome of C. onofrii 
FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T. The genomes of neighboring spe-
cies C. tubakii JCM ­31526T and C. pallidum JCM ­3780T 
also contained a single NRPS-like cluster, with an addi-
tional unknown cluster encoding for terpene synthesis 
predicted for the genome of C. pallidum JCM ­3780T.

Resistance to UV irradiation of the novel yeasts
Survival rates of two novel species and the high-altitude 
cold-adapted N. onofrii exposed to UV-C are presented 
in Fig. 7. The cultivability of all three yeasts dramatically 
decreased due to desiccation before exposing them to 
UV-C irradiation conditions (Additional file 2: Fig. S23). 
The survival of yeasts after desiccation was 22% for N. 
kalamii, 23% for C. onofrii, and 33% for N. onofrii. This 
observed trend might be not only due to the desiccation 
but also the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that was 
used to peel off the dried cells could not be ruled out. 
The number of cultivable cells after desiccation and PVA 
treatment were considered as baseline ­(N0) while calcu-
lating the effect of different doses of radiation (N).
In general, all three yeasts displayed a similar resist-
ance pattern up to 2000  J/m2 with a gradual increase 
of mortality recorded with increasing radiation doses 
(Fig.  7). Among the three yeasts tested, only N. onofrii 
exhibited higher resistance (~ 5.5 × ­103 CFU at 2000 J/m2 
and ~ 4.7 × ­103 CFU at 3000 J/m2 [p < 0.05], with 72% of 
conidia were cultivable after exposure to the highest dos-
age [3000 J/m2]). Even though C. onofrii (~ 2.1 × ­103 CFU) 
and N. kalamii (~ 2.9 × ­103  CFU) exhibited a linear 
decrease in cultivability up to 2000  J/m2, a significant 
decrease in viability was noticed at the 3000 J/m2 dosage 
for both C. onofrii (~ 5.6 × ­102 CFU; p < 0.05; Additional 
file 2: Fig. S23) and N. kalamii (~ 1.2 × ­102 CFU; p < 0.005; 
Additional file  2: Fig. S24). The pink-colored C. onofrii 
retained 27% of the cultivability after UV-C radiation 
exposure whereas the non-pigmented N. kalamii was the 
most sensitive, with only 13% of cultivable cells present 
after 3000  J/m2 of UV-C irradiation. Exposure experi-
ments were repeated twice and showed the same trends.
DISCUSSION
Microorganisms associated with NASA spacecraft 
assembly cleanrooms might hitchhike on spacecraft 
surfaces, contaminate extraterrestrial environments, or 
compromise the life-detection missions. Due to strin-
gent maintenance and cleaning, SAFs can be considered 
as extreme environments since microorganisms found 
in these cleanrooms could withstand unfavorable condi-
tions and survive low nutrient availability, desiccation, 
controlled temperature, etc. Indeed, bacteria and fungi 
isolated from these SAFs are poly-resistant and have been 
reported to withstand harsh and unfavorable conditions. 
Therefore, characterization of yeast species from NASA 
spacecraft assembly cleanrooms is essential.
The identification of yeasts has been shifted from phe-
notypic characterization to sequence-based identification 
and DNA-markers were utilized for defining their phy-
logenetic affiliation (Fonseca et al. 1999; Scorzetti et al. 
2002). Since the 2000s, Naganishia species have been 
identified by considering differences among ribosomal 
gene sequences (ITS and partial LSU), which sometimes 
leads to ambiguous identification in subsequent revi-
sions of the genus (Turchetti et al. 2015; Ruiz and Rad-
wan 2021). Circumscription of the species Cryptococcus 
albidus has a long and complicated history of splitting 
and lumping using the ever-growing array of available 
tests and tools, including whole-cell protein patterns, 
DNA-DNA hybridization, and nucleotide sequencing 
(Fonseca et al. 2011). The species has long been known 
as a variable species and included, as varieties, yeasts 
that are presently placed in other genera and families of 
Filobasidiales (Fonseca et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015). As the 
result of reclassification of the C. albidus species com-
plex using LSU and later ITS sequences, many previous 
varieties were promoted to the taxonomic level of spe-
cies, e.g. Naganishia diffluens, N. globosa, N. liquefaciens, 
Solicoccozyma terrea, Solicoccozyma terricola. Deline-
ation of species using a single ribosomal gene region is 
not always reliable in basidiomycetous yeasts, because 
different lineages strongly vary in their rates of nucleo-
tide substitution (Fell et  al. 2000; Scorzetti et  al. 2002). 
The case of the genus Naganishia is challenging as spe-
cies were delimited based on very few substitutions in the 
two fragments, ITS and LSU. Based on ITS and LSU, the 
albida clade of the genus Naganishia currently include 
three varieties of N. albida (N. albida var. albida CBS

­142T, N. albida var. kuetzingii CBS ­1926T (formerly Cryp-
tococcus kuetzingii), N. albida var. ovalis CBS ­5810T) and 
three other species (N. nivalis DBVPG ­5706T, N. liquefa-
ciens CBS ­968T, N. brisbanensis BRIP 28244; Additional 
file 2: Fig. S1; Scorzetti et al. 2002; Kurtzman et al. 2011; 
Li et al. 2020). However, according to our results, com-
bined sequence analysis of the LSU and ITS sequences, it 
is not possible to differentiate members of N. albida clade 
using the approach due to low discriminatory power and 
lack of bootstrap support (Additional file 2: Fig. S1). Our 
results suggest that the recently described N. brisbanen-
sis (Tan et  al. 2021) might be a taxonomic synonym of 
Cryptococcus kuetzingii, the species that have not been 
included in the original analysis by Tan et al. (2021). To 
improve as much as possible poor species resolution in 
the ITS-LSU tree, a seven-loci (MLSA) and WGS-based 
phylogenies were generated for the discrimination of 
N. albida clade members. The MLSA tree convincingly 
separated N. kalamii from the other members of the N. 
albida clade suggesting that it should be placed in a new 
species rather than keeping as a N. albida variety which 
would further increasing the heterogeneity of the species. 
Furthermore, our MLSA- and WGS-based trees sug-
gest that all the varieties of the N. albida clade are likely 
to be independent species (Fig. 2a). However, the com-
plete reclassification of N. albida must include (either 
as the seven-gene dataset, but preferably WGS) recently 
described N. nivalis and N. brisbanensis, the varieties N. 
albida var. kuetzingii and N. albida var. ovalis, as well as 
some present synonyms of the N. albida, namely Toru-
lopsis rotundata and Torulopsis nadaensis (Fonseca et al. 
2011). In addition, WGS-based phylogeny of the strains 
NY-1402, N6, and I2-R1 from public databases revealed 
that strain NY-1402 is potentially a novel species and 
two other strains (N6, isolated from deep-sea sediment 
and I2-R1, isolated from an ISS HEPA filter for a rodent 
experiment) should be assigned to N. tulchinskyi. These 
examples show that MLSA and WGS analyses are neces-
sary to avoid misidentification (Taylor and Fisher 2003; 
Liu et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015a, b; Vu et al. 2016).
Naganishia strains phylogenetically close to N. kal-
amii are well-adapted to cold environments. Extreme 
conditions might have a selective pressure leading to an 
increase in mutation rates, allowing microbial species to 
adapt to extreme conditions (Turchetti et al. 2015). Most 
of the Naganishia species (N. vaughanmartiniae, N. onof-
rii, N. friedmannii, N. cerealis, N. randhawae, N. globosa, 
N. adeliensis, N. liquefaciens and N. albida) are able to 
grow at low temperatures (4 °C) but only N. kalamii and 
N. qatarensis can grow at 35  °C. All the psychrophilic 
or psychrotolerant Naganishia species exhibit the pres-
ence of cold-adapted genes which might have allowed 
them to colonize cold environments such as Antarctica 
and the deep sea (Selbmann et al. 2005, 2013; Turchetti 
et  al. 2015; Fotedar et  al. 2018; Han et  al. 2020; Segal-
Kischinevzky et  al. 2022). N. qatarensis, a halophilic 
yeast isolated from a warm hypersaline marine environ-
ment in Qatar, is reported to grow at 30–35 °C (Fotedar 
et al. 2018). Growth of N. qatarensis at lower tempera-
ture (~ 25 °C) has been reported but it took 8 weeks after 
incubation. Conversely, N. kalamii is able to grow in a 
temperature range of 15–35 °C after 7 days, and growth 
was noticed within 14 days when incubated at 4–10 °C. 
Similar to Naganishia species, the C. onofrii clade con-
sists of three species that were also isolated from cold 
environments (Tsuji et al. 2017; de Menezes et al. 2019) 
and other members of the genus Cystobasidium (n = 12 
species) are among the most common cold-adapted 
species (Buzzini et al. 2018). All members of the genus 
Cystobasidium, including C. onofrii, are psychrophilic 
or psychrotolerant, with optimum growth temperatures 
ranging from 15 to 20 °C.
Cryosphere harbors abundant microbial diversity, 
e.g. Antarctica, Greenland, cold lakes in Argentina, and 
deep sea (Buzzini and Margesin 2014). Cold-adapted 
yeast species are reported to survive while embedded in 
the ice layers of glaciers or in permafrost (Zucconi et al. 
2012; Turchetti et al. 2013), finding micro-conditions that 
are isolated from the surrounding environments (Price 
2000). Low nutrient availability is another limiting factor 
typical of Antarctic ecosystems. The oligotrophic Ant-
arctic yeast C. tubakii, which closely related to C. onofrii, 
does not require amino acids and vitamins for growth, 
and is also able to grow at − 3  °C (Tsuji 2018). Since 
future space missions—for example, ESA JUpiter ICy 
moons Explorer and NASA Europa Clipper missions—
are designed to explore the potential habitability of icy 
moons, the presence of cold-adapted yeasts should be 
monitored in the NASA cleanrooms. For future missions, 
monitoring psychrophiles, xerophiles and halophiles in 
SAFs is of particular interest because they may be capa-
ble of surviving inside or under the icy crust of Europa 
due to its extremely cold and saline environment (Marion 
et al. 2003). For instance, C. lysiniphilum and C. slooffiae 
are reported as halotolerant species (Mokhtarnejad et al. 
2016). Similarly, C. onofrii shows moderately halophilic 
aptitude since it exhibits growth at 10% NaCl.
In general, SAF surfaces are decontaminated with rea-
gents and also kept dry. Our genomic analysis reveals 
that both Naganishia and Cystobasidium species have 
predicted proteins (Pfam and Interpro terms) associ-
ated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response. 
Halotolerance is another adaptation required for yeasts 
typically active in hyper-arid regions, and so the halo-
philic traits detected in the genomes of these species 
also likely contributes to their survival in the cleanroom

environment (Buzzini and Margesin 2014; Logan et  al. 
2021; Yurkov et  al. 2022). As reported by Yurkov et  al. 
2022, members of both genera Naganishia and Cystoba-
sidium (N. albida and C. minutum) were nearly the only 
yeasts isolated from hot and dry sandy soil of the Namib 
desert. N. albida is well-adapted to dry conditions due to 
a thick polysaccharides capsules, which might be respon-
sible for its remarkable ability to survive in air-dried 
autoclaved loamy sand (Vishniac 1985). Highly desic-
cation tolerance has also been reported in N. vishniacii, 
showing almost 100% survival after 27 days at a relative 
humidity of < 1% (Connell et  al. 2014). Another species 
of the genus, N. friedmannii tested for desiccation (along 
with stratospheric low pressure and temperature and UV 
exposure) during stratospheric balloon flights, recorded 
larger numbers of viable cells than bacterial spores. Pres-
ence of the genetic traits associated with desiccation 
and oligotrophy were present in N. kalamii and C. ono-
frii, promoting their presence to the stringent conditions 
found in cleanrooms. Our genomic analysis revealed that 
along with genes related to desiccation tolerance, genes 
related to UV resistance are present in both Naganishia 
and Cystobasidium members. However, the only strain 
exhibiting all gene ontology terms involved in UV resist-
ance is N. vishniacii ANT03-052, firstly isolated from the 
McMurdo Dry Valleys (Antarctica), a terrestrial Mars 
analogue. We may assume that local physical–chemi-
cal parameters of the environment might be one of the 
evolutionary drivers that induce the stabilization of 
the genes required to survive in the extreme conditions 
(Aureli et al. 2023).
UV-C resistance may be a critical factor for micro-
bial survival during interplanetary transport. Most work 
correlates increased UV-C resistance with microbial 
pigmentation (Kreusch and Duarte 2021). Few studies 
recognized the existence of non-pigmented yeasts with 
similar resistance (Moliné et al. 2010; Schmidt et al. 2017; 
Pulschen et  al. 2018; Kreusch and Duarte 2021). Our 
results showed UV-C survival of the non-pigmented N. 
kalamii and the pigmented pink-colored C. onofrii at up 
to 3000 J/m2 UV-C irradiation. Multiple species from the 
non-pigmented Naganishia species are highly resistant 
organisms to UV radiation (Pulschen et al. 2015; Schmidt 
et al. 2017) and our results are in line with this finding. 
Indeed, we found that the polar yeast N. onofrii is more 
resistant to UV-C radiation compared to the pigmented 
C. onofrii, which is capable of synthesizing carotenoids 
with UV shielding properties (Moliné et  al. 2010). Fur-
thermore, cold-adapted yeasts, such N. onofrii are char-
acterized by a thick cell wall and the ability to produce 
an extracellular polysaccharide capsule surrounding 
their cells (Turchetti et  al. 2015), providing robustness 
to the organism when exposed to stress conditions. This 
adaptation is typically found in extremophiles. Indeed, it 
is already demonstrated that deinococcal polysaccharide 
capsule (DeinoPol) has antioxidant properties involved in 
resistance to severe environmental stresses, including UV 
radiation and hydroxyl radicals (Lin et al. 2020). During 
atmospheric transportation, microorganisms must cope 
up with not only with intense UV, but also low tempera-
tures and dehydration (Selbmann et al. 2005, 2013).
The serine proteases of N. kalamii also include some 
hydrolases which were reported to degrade lipids (Leger 
et al. 1997; Muszewska et al. 2017). Protein tyrosine and 
serine/threonine kinase (PF07714), WD domain, G-beta 
repeat (PF00400), Ras family (PF00071), Cytochrome 
P450 (PF00067), Ankyrin repeats (PF12796) and ABC 
transporter (PF00005) are the most abundant Pfam terms 
in all the Naganishia species and are usually associated 
with survival of multiple dessication-rehydration cycles 
(Gao et al. 2017). Heat shock protein 70 and other Pfam 
terms for predicted proteins involved in the dehydra-
tion stress-response were also present in all the Nagan-
ishia species analyzed. However, only the psychrophilic 
N. vishniacii ANT03-052 had genes involved in raffinose 
synthesis (PF05691). Raffinose accumulation is one of the 
adaptive strategies involved against cold shock (Imanishi 
et al. 1998; Egert et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2022).
By comparing the gene conservation and functional 
annotation in the different species analyzed, we identi-
fied that both Naganishia and Cystobasidium species 
present a consistent number of genes related to a sapro-
trophic lifestyle of decaying organic and plant materials 
(PL36; GH5; CE10; GH128; AA1). Moreover, serine pro-
teases S33 and S09X found in N. kalamii, are essential 
hydrolytic enzymes with several functions such as pro-
tein maturation, signal peptide cleavage and transduc-
tion, and intracellular protein turnover. Although both 
are typically understudied in yeast, they have been sug-
gested as a marker for saprotrophy in fungi as they are 
theorized to be less expressed in fungi with a pathogenic 
or animal-associated lifestyle (Muszewska et  al. 2017). 
Furthermore, it has also been suggested that the relatively 
high abundance of the aminopeptidases M01 and the ser-
ine proteases S12, which are both detected in abundance 
in the genome of N. kalamii, may be an indicator of sap-
rotrophy (Muszewska et  al. 2017). The same trend has 
been detected in C. onofrii. Furthermore, genes encoding 
a wide range of glycosyl hydrolases that have the capacity 
to degrade the major plant cell wall polymers (eg. AA1 
for lignin and GH5 for cellulose breakdown) were found 
in both N. kalamii and C. onofrii. Acetyl esterases, found 
in C. onofrii, are an important component of the enzy-
matic machinery for fungal degradation of plant biomass 
and break down xylan-derived oligosaccharides and on 
galactoglucomannan (Venegas et al. 2022). In particular, 

Page 16 of 21
Leo et al. IMA Fungus           (2023) 14:15 
the Acetyl esterases subfamily members are preproen-
zymes, acting in the lysosomal/endosomal system and 
may be involved in the external digestion of proteins in 
saprophytic organisms (Chan et al. 2014). The synthesis 
of extracellular enzymes which degrade organic matter 
and release nutrients is crucial for the survival of sapro-
trophs. However, by comparing the gene conservation 
and functional annotation of the two yeasts described 
here, we observed a loss in gene family (PFAM terms and 
GO-term counts) in both species, which is usually associ-
ated with a host/substrate shift from plants to animals. It 
is worth mentioning that the loss is more remarkable in 
N. kalamii (Muszewska et al. 2017).
CONCLUSIONS
This study underscores the extreme, oligotrophic con-
ditions of meticulously maintained NASA cleanrooms, 
which could potentially house various microbes, includ-
ing significant yeast species. Traditional yeast identi-
fication methods are deemed inadequate, highlighting 
the need for more precise techniques like MLSA and 
WGS, particularly for complex genera like Naganishia. 
The study also warns about these UV-C resistant yeasts, 
including high-altitude, cold-adapted N. onofrii and two 
other NASA cleanroom species, to potentially contami-
nate extraterrestrial environments, thereby posing risks 
to life-detection missions. The presence of these cold-
adapted yeasts in SAF bears implications for future mis-
sions to icy moons. Genomic analysis further reveals 
the potential for survival in harsh conditions, point-
ing to genes linked with desiccation tolerance and UV 
resistance.
