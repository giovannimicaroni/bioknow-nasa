ipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage
of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of
resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability
to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may
compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute
blood ﬂow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in
exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypoth-
eses that 1) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during
exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasocon-
strictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2) chronic exer-
cise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT
blood ﬂow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n  40) and old (24
mo; n  28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary
(YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old
exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk
of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood ﬂow at rest and during exercise
and in vitro -adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in
resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response
to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood
ﬂow in the OSed group (150% increase) and YSed (55% de-
crease) vs. resting values. Both -adrenergic and myogenic vasocon-
striction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries.
Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response be-
tween age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9  0.5 ml·min1·1001 g;
OET, 8.1  0.9 ml·min1·1001 g) and was associated with enhanced
myogenic and -adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries
from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there
is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise
with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT
arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can
augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related
alterations in the regulation of AT blood ﬂow during exercise.

BY THE YEAR 2030, INDIVIDUALS, 85 years and older, will constitute
the fastest-growing segment of the population in the United
States (1), and aging is associated with a decline in maximal
exercise capacity (23, 41, 55, 57, 59, 72), which may contribute
to the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle. During the
transition from rest to exercise, a rapid redistribution of pe-
ripheral blood ﬂow is essential to maintain central venous
return and the instantaneous elevation of cardiac output (30), as
well as augment oxygen (O2) delivery to the active muscula-
ture to match the immediate increase (2 s) in O2 consumption
(7). However, during exercise (52), heat stress (38), and ortho-
static challenges (61), whole-body hemodynamics (i.e., cardiac
output distribution and perturbations in arterial pressure) are
altered in old vs. young subjects. In particular, during exercise,
old age-associated alterations in muscle blood ﬂow (10, 21, 46,
77) result in a mismatching of O2 delivery to O2 consumption
(9, 14, 22), which would expectedly contribute to an age-
related functional decline. Whether aging affects the distribu-
tion of blood ﬂow to other tissues, such as adipose tissue (AT),
during exercise remains to be determined.
We have demonstrated recently that arterial pressure in old
rats decreases during an orthostatic challenge, which was
associated with an inability to elevate vascular resistance in
white AT (61). Furthermore, there was a severely diminished
-adrenergic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries with
old age (61). Given that AT makes up a greater proportion of
body composition with aging in rats (18) and humans (11), a
reduced vasoconstriction of resistance vessels from this tissue
could have signiﬁcant ramiﬁcations on the ability to regulate
AT blood ﬂow in aged individuals to maintain arterial pressure
and muscle blood ﬂow during exercise (19).
The primary role of white AT is the storage and mobilization
of lipids. However, white AT is also regarded as an endocrine
organ (27), as white adipocytes produce mediators that inﬂu-
ence metabolism of lipids and glucose and immune responses
(73, 74). Regulation of AT blood ﬂow is complex and largely
inﬂuenced by pathologies {e.g., type II diabetes and insulin
resistance (28, 36), body composition [obesity (71)], nutri-
tional state [fasting vs. postprandial (70)], and the anatomical
location of AT [e.g., central vs. peripheral; for review, see
Sotornik et al. (64)]}. Although white AT lacks signiﬁcant
parasympathetic innervation (29), there is substantial neuro-
anatomical and neurochemical evidence of a differential sym-
pathetic nervous system (SNS) innervation depending on ana-
tomical location [for review, see Bartness and Bamshad (5)].
Electrical stimulation of nerves innervating white AT results in
a vasoconstriction that is abolished by the -adrenergic recep-
tor blockade (54), suggesting that the regulation of AT blood
ﬂow is inﬂuenced largely by the SNS. During short-duration
exercise (30 min) in young, healthy subjects, there is an
immediate decrease in blood ﬂow to the viscera (2), as well as
subcutaneous and epididymal AT (45), likely consequent to

activation of sympathetic vasoconstrictor neurons. The reduc-
tion of blood ﬂow to these tissues during exercise contributes,
in part, to the effective redistribution of cardiac output to
maximize perfusion of the active musculature and maintenance
of systemic vascular resistance (2, 19). However, given the old
age-associated diminution of -adrenergic vasoconstriction in
resistance arteries from white AT (61), it is likely that AT
blood ﬂow will either remain similar to resting values or
possibly be elevated during the transition from rest to exercise
with old age.
As AT receives a large proportion of cardiac output (8–
12%) under normal resting conditions (18), old age-associated
alterations in AT blood ﬂow could have signiﬁcant conse-
quences on the ability to redirect blood ﬂow to active tissue
during physical activity in the elderly population. However, the
effects of aging and exercise on AT blood ﬂow are unknown.
Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to test the
hypotheses that with old age, 1) there is an inability to mod-
ulate AT blood ﬂow during short-duration dynamic exercise,
and 2) the altered adipose blood ﬂow response with old age
will be associated with a diminished -adrenergic and myo-
genic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries from AT. Given
the ability of exercise training to enhance adrenergic vasocon-
striction in muscle that is not actively recruited during exercise
(43), as well as myogenic vasoconstriction (50), the second
part of this study was to determine whether chronic exercise
training can 1) mitigate putative alterations in AT perfusion
during exercise and 2) improve -adrenergic and myogenic
vasoconstriction in adipose-resistance arteries.
METHODS
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at Texas A&M University and the University of
Florida. All methods complied fully with the National Institutes of
Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, revised
1996. Male Fischer 344 rats were obtained at ages 4–5 mo and 22 mo
and studied at 6 mo and 24 mo to represent young (n  40) and old
(n  28) animals, respectively. The rats were housed individually at
23°C, maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle, and provided rat
chow and water ad libitum. This strain was chosen because cardio-
vascular function decreases with age in these rats without the devel-
opment of hypertension and atherosclerosis (42).
Endurance exercise training. Young and old rats were assigned
randomly to a sedentary (Sed) control group [young (YSed), n  21;
old (OSed), n  13] or an exercise-trained (ET) group [young (YET),
n  19; old (OET), n  15]. ET rats were habituated to treadmill
exercise, during which each rat walked on a motor-driven treadmill at
15 m/min (0° incline), 5 min/day for 3 days. After the habituation
period, the incline was raised to 15° for the duration of the training
period, whereas the 15 m/min speed was maintained. During the ﬁrst
5 wk of training, the time of exercise was increased by 10 min/wk,
until 60-min duration was reached by the 6th wk. The ET rats
continued to exercise 5 days/wk for 60 min/day for the remainder of
the 10- to 12-wk training period. As discussed by Musch et al. (52),
this training intensity [i.e., percent of maximal aerobic capacity
(VO2max)] would correspond to 60–70% in young rats and 70–
80% in old rats of their respective VO2max.
Study 1: AT blood ﬂow at rest and during exercise. Blood ﬂow at
rest and during exercise to the intra-abdominal AT was determined in
YSed (n  13), YET (n  8), OSed (n  7), and OET (n  5) animals
using the radionuclide-tagged microsphere technique, as described
previously (16, 33, 44). Prior to the surgical procedure, Sed animals
were familiarized with treadmill running. During the familiarization
period (2 wk), animals exercised for 10 min/day at a speed of 15
m/min at a 15° incline, two to three times/wk. At least 24 h after the
last exercise bout, during the familiarization or training period, ani-
mals were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (2–2.5%/O2 balance), and a
catheter [Silastic; Dow Corning, Midland, MI; inside diameter (ID)
0.6 mm; outside diameter (OD) 1.0 mm] ﬁlled with heparinized saline
solution (Elkins-Sinn, Cherry Hill, NJ; 100 U/mL) was advanced into
the ascending aorta via the right carotid artery. This catheter was used
for infusion of radiolabeled microspheres for tissue blood ﬂow mea-
surements and for monitoring mean arterial pressure. The carotid
catheter was externalized dorsally and secured to the skin. A second
polyurethane catheter (Braintree Scientiﬁc, Braintree, MA; ID 0.36
mm; OD 0.84 mm) was implanted in the caudal tail artery and
externalized at the tail. This catheter was used to obtain a reference
blood sample, which serves as an artiﬁcial organ for calculating tissue
ﬂows. All surgical procedures, beginning with the initiation and
ending with the withdrawal of anesthesia, lasted 30 min. After the
closure of incisions, the animals were given 4 h to recover, as
previous studies (24) have demonstrated that circulatory dynamics,
regional blood ﬂow, arterial blood gases, and acid-base status are
stable in the awake rat, 1–6 h after gas anesthesia.
After the recovery period, the rat was placed on the treadmill, and
the tail artery catheter was connected to a 1-ml plastic syringe that was
connected to a Harvard Apparatus (Holliston, MA) infusion/with-
drawal pump (model 907), and the carotid artery catheter was con-
nected to a blood-pressure transducer (MLT844; ADInstruments,
Colorado Springs, CO). Exercise was initiated (15 m/min) at a 0°
incline to assure that all animals ran continuously during the testing
period without changing gait patterns (e.g., stop and start running on
the treadmill). After 4 min of total exercise time, blood withdrawal
from the caudal artery (0.25 ml/min) began. The right carotid artery
catheter was disconnected from the pressure transducer, and a distinct
radiolabeled (46Sc, 113Sn, 57Co, or 85Sr) microsphere (15-m diam-
eter; DuPont/NEN, Boston, MA) was infused (2.5  105 in number)
in random order into the ascending aorta and ﬂushed with warmed
saline to assure clearance of the beads. Blood withdrawal from the
caudal artery continued for 45 s after microsphere infusion. After a
30-min recovery period, a second microsphere infusion was per-
formed in conscious, standing animals following the same procedures
as described above. This infusion strategy was used to minimize the
pre-exercise, anticipatory response (3) and facilitates an accurate
“resting” measurement. Following the microsphere infusion, animals
were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (	100 mg/kg ip). The
intra-abdominal adipose pad—deﬁned as the fat that lines the dorsal
wall of the abdominal cavity, separate from the visceral organs, and
lies bilaterally along the vertebral column, extending caudally from
the diaphragm to the pelvis—and kidneys were removed. The radio-
activity level of the tissues was then determined by a gamma-
scintillation counter (Cobra II auto-gamma counter; Packard, Down-
ers Grove, IL) set to record the peak energy activity of each isotope
for 5 min. AT blood ﬂow was calculated by the reference sample
method (33, 44) and expressed in ml·min1·1001 g of tissue. To
account for possible changes in perfusion, due to alterations in arterial
pressure, vascular conductance was calculated (i.e., blood ﬂow/mean
arterial pressure) and expressed in ml·min1·1001 g of tissue/
mmHg. Data were only analyzed and reported for animals that
displayed adequate mixing of the microspheres, as veriﬁed by a
20% difference in blood ﬂow between the right and left kidney.
Study 2: adipose microvessel vasoconstrictor responsiveness. Mi-
crovessel studies from the intra-abdominal white AT were performed
in a separate group of YSed (n  8), YET (n  11), OSed (n  6),
and OET (n  10) animals, according to the methods of Ramsey et al.
(61). After euthanasia (sodium pentobarbital 	100 mg/kg ip), the
intra-abdominal adipose pad was carefully dissected free and placed
in a 4°C ﬁltered physiological saline solution (PSS) buffer (in mM:
147 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO2, 1.17 MgSO4, 5.0 glucose, 2.0
pyruvate, and 3.0 MOPS; pH 7.4). Resistance arteries (300 m

maximal luminal diameter) were isolated with the aid of a stereomi-
croscope (Olympus SVH10). Subsequently, both ends of the artery
were cannulated with glass micropipettes ﬁlled with the ﬁltered PSS
and secured to the pipettes with 11-0 ophthalmic suture (Alcon
Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX). After cannulation, each vessel in the
tissue chamber was transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope
(Olympus IX70), coupled to a video camera (Panasonic WV-BP310)
and video caliper (307A; Colorado Video, Boulder, CO). Intraluminal
pressure in the isolated artery was set at 75 cmH2O (61). Vessels that
exhibited leaks were discarded. Vessels free of leaks equilibrated for
at least 1 h at 37°C, with the bathing solution replaced every 20 min
during this period, and were allowed to develop spontaneous tone. To
determine vasoconstrictor responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE) and
phenylephrine (PE), cumulative additions of each drug (109 to 104
M) were performed (15). Following assessment of vasoconstrictor
responses, the vessels were incubated in Ca2
-free PSS containing
100 M sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to determine maximal passive
lumen diameter. In a separate group of abdominal AT arteries,
myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were determined by increasing
the intraluminal pressure from 0 to 135 cmH2O in 15-cmH2O incre-
ments. The diameter was recorded continuously for 5 min with each
pressure change (51). The passive pressure–diameter relation was
then determined after the vessels were incubated at 37°C for 60 min
in Ca2
-free PSS containing 100 M SNP, with the bathing solution
changed every 20 min. The same protocol, as described for the active
myogenic response, was used to determine passive artery character-
istics.
Muscle oxidative enzyme activity. Citrate synthase, a mitochondrial
enzyme and marker of muscle oxidative potential, was measured in
duplicate from soleus muscle homogenates, according to the method
of Srere (65). Citrate synthase activity, expressed as mol·min1·g1
wet weight, was measured spectrophotometrically using a SpectraMax
M5 microplate (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in 300-l ali-
quots at 30°C to determine the efﬁcacy of the training protocol.
Data presentation. The development of spontaneous tone was
expressed as the percent vasoconstriction relative to the maximal
intraluminal diameter measured according to
spontaneous tone (%)  (IDmax  IDb) ⁄ IDmax  100
where IDmax is the maximal passive intraluminal diameter recorded at
a pressure of 75 cmH2O, and IDb is the steady-state baseline diameter.
Vasoconstrictor responses to NE and PE were expressed as the
percent change from baseline diameter according to
vasoconstriction (%)  (IDb  IDss) ⁄ IDb  100
where IDb is the initial diameter recorded before the addition of the
vasoconstrictor, and IDss is the steady-state diameter measured after
each dose of the drug. Active myogenic responses after sequential
intraluminal pressure changes were normalized according to
normalized diameter  (IDss  ID75)
where IDss is the steady-state diameter measured after each step
change in intraluminal pressure, and ID75 is the diameter measured at
75 cmH2O during the passive pressure response, which reﬂects the
maximal diameter for vessels in which active and passive pressure
responses were determined.
Statistical analysis. Dose-response curves were analyzed by two-
way ANOVA with repeated measures to detect differences between
(experimental groups) and within (concentration or pressure) factors.
Post hoc analyses were performed using Duncan’s multiple range test.
Vascular sensitivity, the concentration of NE or PE exhibiting EC50,
was determined by logarithmic curve-ﬁtting equations. A one-way
ANOVA was performed to determine the signiﬁcance of differences
among groups in vessel characteristics, body masses, and citrate
synthase activity. All values are presented as means  SE. P  0.05
was required for signiﬁcance.
RESULTS
Body mass, mean arterial pressure, and citrate synthase
activity. Body mass and mean arterial pressure at rest and
during exercise are described in Table 1. The efﬁcacy of the
training program was conﬁrmed with a signiﬁcant increase in
citrate synthase activity of the soleus in both young (YSed,
15  2 mol·g1·min1; YET, 20  2 mol·g1·min1; P 
0.05) and old (OSed, 14  2 mol·g1·min1; OET, 19  2
mol·g1·min1; P  0.05) groups.
Intra-abdominal AT blood ﬂow and vascular conductance at
rest and during exercise. In the sedentary animals at rest, there
was lower AT blood ﬂow in the old group vs. younger
counterparts (Fig. 1A). Exercise training signiﬁcantly elevated
adipose perfusion at rest in both age groups and abolished
age-related differences in resting ﬂow (Fig. 1A). Vascular
conductance measured at rest paralleled blood ﬂow measures
in all groups (Fig. 1B). During the steady state of exercise,
there was a signiﬁcantly higher AT blood ﬂow in OSed vs.
YSed (Fig. 2A). Exercise training resulted in an elevated
adipose perfusion during exercise to YET and a reduced ﬂow
to OET vs. sedentary counterparts (Fig. 2A); age-related dif-
ferences in adipose blood ﬂow were no longer present. Despite
small differences in arterial pressure among groups during
exercise (Table 1), vascular conductance measures paralleled
those of blood ﬂow among groups (Fig. 2B). When comparing
vascular conductance responses during the transition from rest
to exercise, all groups showed signiﬁcant differences, albeit
there was a directionally opposite response in the OSed vs.

YSed groups. Speciﬁcally, compared with resting values, there
was an 55% decrease in vascular conductance in YSed and
an 110% increase in vascular conductance in OSed during
exercise (Fig. 3). After exercise training, both OET and YET
demonstrated a similar decrease (50%) in vascular conduc-
tance from rest to exercise, and age-related differences were
abolished (Fig. 3).
Intra-abdominal AT-resistance artery characteristics. The
maximal diameter and spontaneous tone of resistance arteries
from intra-abdominal AT are listed in Table 1. Compared with
YSed, there was a tendency for a greater maximal diameter and
signiﬁcantly less tone in intra-abdominal AT arteries from the
OSed group. After exercise training, there were no differences
in maximal diameter or spontaneous tone between age groups
(Table 1). Tone was signiﬁcantly greater in OET vs. OSed.
Vasoconstrictor responses. NE elicited a concentration-de-
pendent vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries from all
groups (Fig. 4A). The constriction evoked by NE was signiﬁ-
cantly lower in OSed vs. YSed, and exercise training resulted
in a signiﬁcantly greater contractile response to NE in OET vs.
OSed (Fig. 4A). There was a greater vasoconstriction after
exercise training, only at the highest concentration (104 M) in
YET (59  4%) vs. YSed (45  4%, P  0.05) and OET
(46  6%, P  0.05). There was a lower sensitivity to NE in
OSed vs. YSed (Table 1). There were no differences in sensi-
tivity to NE between YET and OET, although there was an
enhanced sensitivity in OET vs. OSed (Table 1). PE produced
similar concentration-dependent, contractile responses in AT-
resistance arteries from all groups (Fig. 4B). Vasoconstrictor
responses to PE were diminished in OSed vs. YSed, and

exercise training enhanced contractile responses to PE in the
old group but did not signiﬁcantly affect that of the young
group (Fig. 4B) vs. age-matched sedentary counterparts. Al-
though there were no group response differences to PE be-
tween YET and OET, the constriction elicited by 105 and
104 M PE was greater in the YET (55  4 and 64  5%,
respectively) vs. OET (44  4 and 49  5%, respectively; P 
0.05). There was a lower sensitivity to PE in OSed vs. YSed
(Table 1). Exercise training did not affect sensitivity to PE in
the young group but enhanced sensitivity signiﬁcantly in OET
vs. OSed (Table 1). There were no differences in sensitivity to
PE between the trained groups (Table 1).
Myogenic responses. In the sedentary group, at all pressures
above zero, the active diameter was signiﬁcantly larger in
arteries from OSed vs. YSed (Fig. 5). Exercise training abol-
ished age-related differences in the active myogenic response
among groups (Fig. 5A). There were no differences in the
passive pressure–diameter response among groups (Fig. 5B).
DISCUSSION
The overall purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis
that old age-related vascular dysfunction in AT would ad-
versely affect the ability to redistribute blood ﬂow away from
AT during exercise. In support of our hypothesis, there was an
increase in AT blood ﬂow and vascular conductance during
exercise in old rats, whereas there was a decrease in AT blood
ﬂow and vascular conductance in young, healthy controls
(Figs. 2 and 3). To investigate potential mechanisms for this
disparate blood ﬂow response to AT during exercise, we
measured AT-resistance artery contractile responses to -ad-
renergic and myogenic stimuli, both of which were found to be
diminished in the OSed vs. YSed group (Figs. 4 and 5). After
chronic aerobic training, the directional change and magnitude
of AT perfusion and vascular conductance from rest to exercise
were similar between young and old groups (Figs. 1–3). Fur-
thermore, there was a signiﬁcant improvement in both intra-
abdominal AT arterial -adrenergic and myogenic vasocon-
striction with old age after exercise training. It is likely that the
inability to rapidly divert blood ﬂow away from AT with old
age contributes to reductions in arterial pressure during ortho-
static challenges (61) and heat stress (38), as well as altered
whole-body hemodynamics during physical activity (39).
However, after exercise training, many of the old, age-associ-
ated alterations in AT blood ﬂow and vasoconstrictor responses
in adipose-resistance arteries were abolished. This suggests
that an enhanced ability to centrally mobilize blood volume
from AT after chronic training may be a contributing mecha-
nism to the enhanced muscle blood ﬂow during exercise (6)
and the increased ability to tolerate orthostatic challenges (49)
in older individuals.
Regulation of AT blood ﬂow. AT blood ﬂow is intricately
linked to metabolism for adequate substrate and humoral de-
livery (64) and is tightly regulated through autonomic and
endocrine signaling, as well as intrinsic autoregulatory mech-
anisms of AT-resistance vessels (75). Electrical stimulation of
nerves innervating inguinal white AT elicits a robust vasocon-
striction that is abolished by -adrenergic receptor blockade
(54), suggesting an immediate decrease in AT vascular con-

ductance with enhanced SNS activity. However, AT vascular
responses to systemic intravenous infusion of NE produce
conﬂicting results that appear to be time dependent. For exam-
ple, experiments that elevate systemic NE concentrations in
humans (all of which result in elevated arterial pressure)
demonstrate a decreased (32) or increased (40) vascular con-
ductance and augmented blood ﬂow (60) in subcutaneous AT.
In the latter two studies, it should be noted that despite plasma
NE concentrations reaching a steady state within 5–10 min,
signiﬁcant changes in AT blood ﬂow did not occur until 15–30
min after NE infusion began, thus suggesting that a prolonged
exposure is required to elicit changes in vascular conductance.
In the current study, we observe a robust vasoconstriction in
resistance arteries from centrally located intra-abdominal AT
in the young group to both NE and PE (Fig. 4, A and B,
respectively), which is in contrast to some human data showing
an increased AT vascular conductance to systemically elevated
NE levels (40). The reasons for the disparate ﬁndings between
the isolated vessel rapid contraction to NE and studies showing
an increased adipose perfusion to elevated systemic NE over
longer time frames (60) are unknown but may be related to
tissue-speciﬁc vascular properties (peripheral vs. central) or the
large elevation in arterial pressure with systemic NE infusion
(40, 60) concomitant with the loss of myogenic autoregulation
at higher transmural pressures in AT-resistance vessels (75).
The effect of exercise on AT blood ﬂow appears to be
dependent largely on the duration of exercise. In the current
study, there was a reduction in blood ﬂow (Fig. 2A) and
vascular conductance (Fig. 3) when transitioning from rest to
exercise in young, healthy subjects, due, in part, to an active
vasoconstriction in AT. This observation is consistent with
other studies that demonstrate an immediate (5 min) decrease
in perfusion of epididymal (45) adipose depots and subcutane-
ous fat [(45), and see Armstrong et al. (2) for exception] during
dynamic whole-body exercise. However, with longer durations
of exercise, blood ﬂow to AT increases, likely consequent to an
increased delivery of free fatty acids from AT (25), suggesting
that any initial vasoconstriction during exercise onset is mod-
iﬁed later by circulating humoral or endocrine factors (25) and
possibly tachyphylaxia of adrenergic receptors (66). Given that
stimulation of nerves innervating white AT simultaneously
enhance lipolysis rate and induce a strong vasoconstriction
(54), there may be an impaired release of free fatty acids during
exercise. Indeed, upon the cessation of exercise, fatty acids are
suddenly “washed out” of AT, which may be related to the
release of vasoconstrictor tone manifest during exercise [re-
viewed in Frayn et al. (26)].
Aging, exercise training, and AT function. In the current
study, adipose blood ﬂow was signiﬁcantly lower at rest in old
vs. young subjects. There are several potential mechanisms for
the lower ﬂow at rest with old age, including 1) diminished
vascular endothelial function (8, 17, 63); 2) elevated oxidative
stress from AT (4), which may diminish the bioavailabilty of
nitric oxide; and 3) signiﬁcantly elevated basal SNS activity
with old age (53), offsetting a diminished -adrenergic sensi-
tivity (Table 1). During submaximal exercise, the plasma NE
responses are either similar (37, 39) or smaller (31) in old vs.
young subjects, which in combination with a diminished -ad-
renergic vasoconstriction (Fig. 4), likely contributes to the
large increase in blood ﬂow to AT during exercise in the OSed
group. After exercise training, the AT blood ﬂow response
between age groups was largely normalized (Figs. 1 and 2),
which is associated with an elevated blood ﬂow to oxidative
skeletal muscle during exercise (10). Without measurement of
cardiac output, the precise relationship between the reduced
AT observed herein and the elevated skeletal muscle blood
ﬂow with aging after training (10) cannot be determined and
warrants future investigations. In healthy, young men, exercise
training does not appear to alter adipose perfusion, as there are
no differences in AT blood ﬂow between sedentary and endur-
ance-trained subjects at rest (67), despite a greater blood ﬂow
response to AT with adrenaline infusion after training (68). In
the current study, at rest, there was an enhanced blood ﬂow to
AT in both age groups after endurance training vs. age-
matched sedentary counterparts (Fig. 1A). Although not mea-
sured in the current study, there are several potential mecha-
nisms responsible for changes in AT blood ﬂow after training,
including
1)
alterations
in
plasma
NE
concentrations,
2) changes in the expression or location of adipose vascular
adrenergic receptors, and 3) enhanced adipose vessel endothe-
lial function. Changes in sympathetic nerve activity or differ-
ences in plasma NE concentrations affecting resistance artery
function are unlikely, as endurance training has little effect on
resting sympathetic nerve activity (62) with lower (34) or
unchanged (12, 58) plasma NE concentrations after training.
Given that AT blood ﬂow is inﬂuenced largely by -adrenergic
receptor function (1a), differences in the expression of adren-
ergic receptors (e.g., diminished 1-receptor density with old
age) among groups could contribute to differences in adipose
blood ﬂow. Given that both aging (8, 17, 63) and obesity (20)
diminish resistance artery endothelial function, it is likely that
improvements in endothelial function after exercise training
(47, 56, 63) contributed to the greater AT perfusion at rest.
During the transition from rest to exercise with old age, the
AT blood ﬂow response was directionally opposite (reduction
in ﬂow) in the exercise-trained vs. sedentary group (increased
ﬂow vs. rest; Figs. 1A and 2A). The AT blood ﬂow response in
old age after training suggests an enhanced vasoconstriction
within the AT-resistance vasculature. Indeed, in AT-resistance
arteries, there was an enhanced -adrenergic (Fig. 4, A and B)
and myogenic (Fig. 5A) vasoconstriction after training with old
age. We are unaware of any other studies that have looked
speciﬁcally at the effects of aging and/or exercise training on
adipose-resistance artery function. However, exercise training
has been shown to enhance -adrenergic-mediated vasocon-
striction within tissue that is not recruited during exercise (i.e.,
shows no net hyperemic response) (43), suggesting a possible
systemic effect on adrenergic receptor function. There is also
evidence that exercise training enhances myogenic vasocon-
striction (17), which was demonstrated in the old group after
training (Fig. 5A). The precise mechanisms for the altered
AT-resistance artery vasoconstriction observed herein remain
to be determined but likely contribute to an increased ability to
mobilize free fatty acids after exercise training (13, 69).
Conclusions. In summary, -adrenergic receptor-mediated
and myogenic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries are
diminished with aging, which was associated with an increase
in AT blood ﬂow during exercise in the OSed group. Exercise
training augmented adrenergic vasoconstriction in adipose ar-
teries with old age, which likely contributed, in part, to the
reduction in adipose blood ﬂow during exercise relative to
sedentary counterparts. An age-associated deﬁcit in -adren-

ergic vasoconstriction in AT may contribute to the impaired
baroreﬂex buffering with old age (35, 76) and result in a spatial
overperfusion of AT during exercise. Whereas the possibility
that a blunted adipose vasoconstriction with old age diminishes
the ability to redistribute blood ﬂow to the active muscles
during exercise in humans is likely, elegant studies are required
to address this issue mechanistically.
