Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to
biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be
directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or
extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters
derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low
sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure.
The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to
biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have
been linked to microbiologically inﬂuenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured
directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ). To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel
degradation and microbially inﬂuenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study
of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identiﬁed the microorganisms
associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations
were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location.
The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae,
and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same
taxa, including a ﬁlamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae, not yet widely
recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family
of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae
were correlated with signiﬁcant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identiﬁed
the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the
microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To
our knowledge this is the ﬁrst in situ study of this scale incorporating community and
corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment.

Microbiologically Inﬂuenced Corrosion in Biodiesel
INTRODUCTION
The use of renewable fuels is on the rise worldwide (Beiter
and Tian, 2016). One renewable fuel in use broadly is biodiesel,
which is composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived
from plant and animal lipids. Biodiesel is commonly used as a
replacement or additive to ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) up
to 5% v/v to restore lubricity lost due to the removal of sulfur
compounds (Steidley and Knothe, 2005; Moser, 2009; Gill et al.,
2012). Blends containing up to 20% v/v biodiesel (i.e., B20) can be
used without changes to existing engines or infrastructure (U.S.
Air Force Energy Strategic Plan [USAF], 2010). Combustion of
these blends produces reduced nitric oxide emissions, an ozone
precursor of concern, than pure biodiesel fuel (Basha et al., 2009).
The consumption of biodiesel has increased worldwide over the
past 10 years because of its combustion properties (Chang et al.,
1996; Canakci, 2007), performance advantages, and increasingly
strict emissions regulations (Blakeley, 2012).
The advantages oﬀered by blending biodiesel with ULSD
are potentially oﬀset by the drawback of lower fuel stability
(Lisiecki et al., 2014). Biodiesel contains more dissolved oxygen
than ULSD, reducing oxidative stability and increasing the
risk of fuel biodegradation (Speidel et al., 2000). Biodiesel is
also more hygroscopic than ULSD (Fregolente et al., 2012),
causing blends like B20 to absorb and retain more water. Water
in fuel represents habitat for microorganisms and is essential
for microbial metabolism and growth; water entrained within
fuel enables microbiological proliferation, resulting in fouling.
Liquid water is denser than fuel and will accumulate at the
bottom of any storage vessel. Microorganisms at the fuel-water
interface are able to live in an aqueous environment with
the fuel as an oxidizable substrate and source of dissolved
oxygen (Prince et al., 2008). Fouling (e.g., the accumulation of
biomass) is greatest at the fuel-water interface and microbial
metabolism quickly depletes any oxygen in the water (Prince
et al., 2008; Owsianiak et al., 2009; Bucker et al., 2011;
Passman, 2013).
Microbial growth and subsequent corrosion are dependent
upon fuel chemistry and the amount of water present (Aktas
et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010). Biodiesel and biodiesel blends do
not contain free fatty acids by speciﬁcation, but copious amounts
of fatty acids are produced as bi-products of the metabolism
of FAME by microorganisms (Aktas et al., 2010; Yassine et al.,
2013) that may result in microbiologically inﬂuenced corrosion
(MIC) of steel tanks or tank components. Polymer tank seals
and ﬁttings that are also exposed to organic acids can exhibit
decreased ductility and strength. Production of CO2 during the
microbial metabolism of FAME could also increase the rate of
corrosion within a storage tank (Crolet et al., 1999). General

production and dissolution of acid and CO2 within a ﬂuid
can result in uniform corrosion, where the loss of material is
distributed across a surface. The accumulation of bioﬁlms results
in several possible outcomes including the localized production
and concentration of corrosive compounds, the formation of
galvanic couples, and the ennoblement of steel surfaces. Any of
these would result in localized corrosion that is characterized by
deep, penetrating pits on metallic surfaces that represent a great
risk to storage tank infrastructure (Lee et al., 2009; Little and Lee,
2014). The link between biodegradation and corrosion has been
studied in other petroleum environments such as oil production,
drilling (Duncan et al., 2009; Stevenson et al., 2011), or storage of
petroleum products in marine environments including biodiesel
(Aktas et al., 2010; Lyles et al., 2013) yet no in situ study exists to
this point in B20 storage and distribution systems.
For over a decade, the United States Air Force (USAF) has
stored B20 biodiesel and used it in non-tactical support vehicles
as a component of their Strategic Energy Plan (Blakeley, 2012).
The adoption of B20 biodiesel by the USAF, however, correlated
with an increase in reports of “bad fuel,” or fouling due to visible
particulates in the fuel and clogged ﬁlters at dispensers. We
hypothesized that the reported fouling was microbiological in
origin, rather than from the abiotic production of waxes in fuel
that was suspected by fuel operators and reported previously
(Tang et al., 2008; Botella et al., 2014). Both fuel fouling and
MIC have the potential to impact the operation of B20 biodiesel
storage and distribution systems. Pure cultures and enrichments
of microorganisms have shown the ability to degrade biodiesel
blends (including B20) and induce corrosion under laboratory
conditions (Prince et al., 2008; Bucker et al., 2011; Wang et al.,
2011) but no studies link the microbial community and its
proliferation with corrosion in active storage tanks over time.
To this end, we conducted a rare longitudinal study, in situ, of
microbial community dynamics linked to the corrosion of steel
in B20 biodiesel underground storage tanks (UST). Two USAF
locations housing B20 biodiesel tanks with recurrent fuel quality
issues were selected for this study. We hypothesized that the
reported issues were the result of microbial contamination and
predicted that corrosion would be greatest in tanks with the
most biomass. We subsequently conducted a 1-year survey of the
microbial communities present at both storage locations to link
microbiological fouling, fuel degradation, and MIC in situ within
each storage tank.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Description of Sampling Sites
The yearlong longitudinal study described here was conducted
at two USAF bases, which were located in the SE and SW
United States. Each base had three storage tanks containing B20
biodiesel (total of 6 tanks) that were under normal operation
throughout the study. The only exception was tank SE 3, which
was removed from the study after 9 months due to severe
microbiological contamination that required mitigation. These
tanks were not on a deﬁned cleaning schedule. Instead, they
were taken oﬄine and cleaned as fouling or contamination was

detected. All tanks at SW and two tanks at SE (SE 3 and 4)
were cleaned just prior to the onset of the study and insertion
of corrosion or “witness” coupons. The sampled tanks had an
atmospheric (i.e., oxic) headspace and no biocides were used in
the fuels stored at each location. The three tanks at SW were
constructed of uncoated carbon steel and installed in the early
1950s. At the SE site, two of the tanks (SE 3 and SE 4) were
ﬁberglass and located at the same fueling station. The third
tank (SE E) was made of carbon steel, lined on the outside
with ﬁberglass, and located at another fueling station. Each of
the six tanks had a large maintenance hatch (i.e., “manway”)
that was used as an access point for access and fuel sampling
(Supplementary Figure S1). A visual overview of the sampling
protocol, including references to the relevant methods sections is
included for clarity as Supplementary Figure S3.
In situ Incubation and Sampling of
Corrosion Coupons
A PVC rack was used to suspend materials in the fuel phase
(60 cm from bottom of tank, top of rack) and in contact
with any water phase if it existed (1 cm from bottom of
tank, bottom of rack) (Supplementary Figure S2). Four types
of materials typical of fuel systems were exposed to these
in situ conditions: pre-weighed uncoated and epoxy-coated
steel (ACT Test Panel LLC., Hillsdale, MI, United States) test
specimens commonly known as “witness coupons,” and O-Rings
made of V747-75 ﬂuorocarbon or N602-70 nitrile, polymers
commonly used in fuel systems (Personal communication, Air
Force Petroleum Oﬃce). Epoxy coated coupons were prepared
by the AFRL Coatings Technology Integration Oﬃce (Wright-
Patterson AFB, OH, United States) using three coats- (1) A
base of MIL-P-24441/20 epoxy/polyamide, formula 150 type III;
(2) An intermediate coat of MIL-P-244413/30 epoxy/polyamide,
formula 151 type IV; and (3) A topcoat of MIL-P-24441/31
epoxy/polyamide, formula 152 type IV. The metal test specimens
(uncoated, n = 396, and epoxy-coated steel, n = 283) measured
2.54 cm × 7.62 cm were divided evenly between the top
and bottom of each rack and removed at ≈3-month intervals
at SE, or ≈6-month intervals at SW. As a control, sterile,
uncoated witness coupons and sterile O-rings were incubated
separately in 0.22 µm ﬁlter-sterilized B20 taken from fuel samples
received at each site prior to exposure to storage tanks (n = 9
for each location).
Replicate witness coupons (n ≥5) were removed from each
underground storage tank (UST) at speciﬁed time intervals
and photographed on-site. Sampled coupons were subjected to
several types of analyses: characterization of bioﬁlm microbial
communities by DNA sequencing, microscopy, and quantitation
of uniform and pitting corrosion by mass loss and microscopy,
respectively. A schematic representation of the sampling
workﬂow is shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Bioﬁlms
were sampled for molecular community analyses from triplicate
(n = 3) witness coupons immediately following their removal
from the tank as detailed below. Any bioﬁlm present on the
remaining two (n = 2) coupons was left intact. Otherwise,
all coupons were stored in a desiccating environment to
prevent additional corrosion and shipped overnight prior to
further analyses.
Sampling, DNA Extraction, Small Subunit
rRNA Gene Library Preparation, and
Sequencing of Microbial Biomass
Samples of both bioﬁlms and fuel were taken at each timepoint
for molecular analyses, as summarized in Supplementary
Figure S3. For molecular analyses of bioﬁlm, the surface of
each coupon was immediately sampled after removal from the
tank using nylon ﬂocked swabs (Therapak Corp, Los Angeles,
CA, United States). Each swab was placed into a 2.0 mL ZR
BashingBeadTM Lysis Tube (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA,
United States) containing 0.7 mL (dry volume) of 0.5 mm ZR
BashingBeadTM lysis matrix (Zymo Research Corp.) and 750 µL
XpeditionTM Lysis/Stabilization Solution (Zymo Research Corp.)
and homogenized for 30 s on site using a sample cup attached
to a cordless reciprocating saw. Fuel samples were collected and
processed within 2–4 h.
Fuel samples were taken at each time point from the bottom
of each tank via the access hatch using a 500 mL Bacon
bomb fuel sampler (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Hampton, NH,
United States). Approximately 1 L of fuel was ﬁltered through
a 120 mm 0.22 µm polyether sulfone bottle-top ﬁlter. At SE,
the ﬁltered fuel was also retained for acid-index determination.
The resulting ﬁlter was quartered after sampling using a sterile
scalpel, and three of these quarters were placed into individual ZR
BashingBeadTM Lysis tubes containing 0.7 mL (dry volume) of
0.5 mm ZR BashingBeadTM lysis matrix (Zymo Research Corp.)
and 750 µL XpeditionTM Lysis/Stabilization Solution (Zymo
Research Corp.), for a total of three technical replicates per
sampling. These samples were homogenized for 30 s on site using
a sample cup attached to a cordless reciprocating saw, transported
overnight at room temperature and stored at −20◦C until needed.
Prior to DNA extraction, the samples were homogenized for
an additional 30 s using a BioSpec Mini-BeadBeater-8 (Biospec
Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, United States). DNA extractions
were performed per manufacturer speciﬁcations using the Zymo
XpeditionTM Kit (Zymo Research Corp.).
Libraries of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic small subunit
(SSU) rRNA gene fragments were ampliﬁed from each DNA
extraction using a single set of PCR with primers that spanned the
SSU rRNA gene V4/V5 hypervariable regions between position
515 and 926 (E. coli numbering) as described previously (Parada
et al., 2015; Kraus et al., 2018). The primers used were selected to
evenly amplify all three domains of life simultaneously (Parada
et al., 2015). To mitigate the eﬀects of contaminating DNA (Salter
et al., 2014), multiple extraction blanks and negative controls
were sequenced from each batch of extractions. All SSU rRNA
gene libraries were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq V2 PE250
chemistry at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation.
Analysis of SSU rRNA Gene Sequencing
Libraries
Initial quality control, demultiplexing, and OTU clustering at
97 percent sequence similarity was performed as previously

described (Stamps et al., 2016), with the modiﬁcation of using
mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) to assign taxonomy against the
SILVA database (r128) (Pruesse et al., 2007) formatted for use
with mothur. Statistical analyses and ﬁgures were generated
within R using Phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013) and
AmpVis (Albertsen et al., 2015). Diﬀerences in community
composition were estimated using the weighted UniFrac index
(Lozupone and Knight, 2005). Datasets were rareﬁed to 2000
sequences per sample for bacteria/archaea, and 1500 sequences
per sample for the eukarya to produce ordinations and perform
PERMANOVA analyses. The eﬀect of site, tank, material, and the
location of materials within each tank (top or bottom) were tested
by a PERMANOVA within the R package Vegan (Dixon, 2003).
Sequencing reads are available under the accessions SRR5826605-
SRR5826609. The mapping ﬁle necessary for demultiplexing in
QIIME is available in Supplementary Table S1.
Estimation of Final Coupon Biomass
The growth of bioﬁlms within the tanks was determined by
measuring the biomass attached to the polymer-coated witness
coupons. After 12 months of exposure (9 months for SE 3), all
pre-weighed polymer coated coupons were removed from each
UST at both locations, photographed on site, placed into sterile
50 mL conical tubes, and shipped overnight for further analysis.
Upon arrival, coupons were desiccated to remove any water or
fuel, weighed, and then cleaned using the ASTM standard G1-
03 hydrochloric acid method (G01 Committee, 2012). Brieﬂy,
coupons were sonicated for 10 min in soapy water, rinsed in
deionized water, dried, and incubated in 3 M hydrochloric acid
with 3.5 g/L hexamethylene tetramine solution for 10 min.
Acid cleaned coupons were washed in deionized water, acetone,
and methanol, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and weighed.
Biomass at 12 months was estimated as the diﬀerence in the
weight of the coupons prior to cleaning (after desiccation) and
after cleaning. No obvious degradation of the polymer coating
was observed visually before or after removal of the bioﬁlm from
sampled coupons.
Microscopy and Determination of
Corrosion on Witness Coupons
Bioﬁlms were visualized on undisturbed uncoated steel witness
coupons (n = 2 per UST, per timepoint) by optical and
electron microscopy prior to coupon cleaning. For determination
of general corrosion, bioﬁlm and corrosion products were
removed from coupons (n = 5 per UST, per timepoint)
via ASTM standard G1-03 C.3.5 (G01 Committee, 2012) as
detailed in section “Analysis of SSU rRNA Gene Sequencing
Libraries.” After cleaning, the mass of each coupon was
compared to its pre-exposure mass to determine mass loss.
A subset of steel witness coupons (n = 2 per time point)
was imaged by several complementary approaches: SEM,
confocal microscopy, and proﬁlometry. Coupons with intact
bioﬁlms that were intended for microscopic analysis were
scored with a 2 × 14 grid to enable correlation between
locations imaged prior to the removal of biomass and after
imaging for pitting corrosion via proﬁlometry (each quadrant
roughly 9 × 11 mm). Select coupons were then imaged
with the bioﬁlm in place using a VHX 2000E (Keyence
Corp., Itasca, IL, United States) digital microscope from 20
to 200× magniﬁcation. Areas of interest were subsequently
imaged using an FEI Quanta 600 environmental scanning
electron microscope (ESEM, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Co.,
Waltham, MA, United States). Three to ﬁve areas were imaged
with SEM per coupon.
Coupons designated for pitting measurement were imaged
after cleaning using a VK-X250 3D Laser Scanning Confocal
Microscope (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, United States) to measure
the depth of each pit and surface roughness. Each coupon
was imaged under 10× magniﬁcation at 42 identical locations.
Maximum pitting rates (recorded as MPY) were calculated for
each sample point by the formula Deepest Pit (mm)× 365
Exposure Time (Days) to calculate
the rate of corrosion in mm/year and then converted to a value
of MPY by multiplying the result by 39.4 (1 mm/y = 39.4
MPY). Pits were deﬁned as a region that was a minimum of
10 µm below the mathematically determined reference plane
(surface) and at least 200 µm2 in area. A Shapiro-Wilk (Shapiro
and Wilk, 1965) test of normalcy (p > 0.05) was used to
determine normality of the dataset, after which a non-parametric
Van der Waerden test (Van Der Waerden, 1953) was used to
compare ﬁeld coupons to sterile controls. Multiple pairwise
tests comparing in situ incubations to controls were carried out
post hoc using a Conover test (Gellings and Gudger, 2012) within
the package PMCMR, and p values were corrected using the false
discovery rate (FDR) method (Yekutieli and Benjamini, 2001)
within PMCMR. Correlation between the presence of bioﬁlm and
corrosion was determined using coupons scored with a diamond
knife to facilitate sample orientation, which were imaged by SEM
and by confocal microscopy VK-X250.
Tensile Testing of Polymeric Seal
Materials
At each time point, O-ring specimens (n = 3) were removed
from each tank and the sterile controls, photographed on-
site, and the accumulated bioﬁlm was removed prior to
testing. The cleaned O-rings were placed into sterile 50 ml
conical tubes and shipped overnight for analysis. Tensile testing
(strength and elongation) of the O-rings was conducted at the
University of Dayton Research Institute in accordance with
the test methods and procedures referenced in ASTM D1414
and included analyses of percent elongation, tensile strength,
and maximum load.
Determination of Fuel Acid Index
The acid index of fuel samples taken from the bottom of tanks at
the SE location was measured by acid titration using the ASTM
standard D974 (D27 Committee, 2008) method at the 3, 7, and
9 months time points. Approximately 20 g of B20 suspended in
100 mL of titration solvent (100:1: 99 Toluene/Water/Isopropyl
alcohol) and 0.5 mL of an indicator solution was titrated
using a 0.1 N solution of KOH dissolved in isopropyl alcohol
(Sigma Aldrich).

Microbiologically Inﬂuenced Corrosion in Biodiesel
RESULTS
Microbial Diversity and Taxonomic
Composition
Surface samples taken at each time point in each UST from
coated coupons, uncoated coupons, and O-rings (representing
bioﬁlm communities), and ﬁlter quarters (representing fuel
communities) were sequenced after sampling. After clustering
and quality control, 3.04 million reads remained, which clustered
into 759 OTUs across all three domains of life from 306
samples (Supplementary Table S2). Mean library size for
Bacteria and Archaea was 6857 reads, and 3470 for the Eukarya
(Supplementary Table S2). Due to low sequence count, after
rarefaction 59 samples and 9 OTUs were removed from beta
diversity analyses within the bacterial/archaeal dataset, while 76
samples and 29 OTUs were removed from the eukaryotic dataset.
The community structure and composition of sampled
bioﬁlms varied signiﬁcantly between bases (Bacteria p = 0.001;
R2 = 0.12, Eukaryota p = 0.001; R2 = 0.23) and among diﬀerent
tanks at each base (Bacteria p = 0.001; R2 = 0.37, Eukaryota
p = 0.001; R2 = 0.34). Members of the Acetobacteraceae
(acetic acid bacteria) or the Clostridiaceae group 1 were the
most abundant taxa detected in the tanks at SW, whereas
OTUs most closely related to the genera Pannonibacter
(Family
Rhodobacteraceae)
and
Nitrospirillum
(Family
Rhodospirillaceae) were more abundant in SE tanks (Figure 1).
An OTU (OTU 1 within the Eukaryotic dataset) that was present
and often very abundant at both locations was identiﬁed as
an unclassiﬁed member of the Eurotiomycetes. Additional
identiﬁcation via BLAST suggested that it was a ﬁlamentous
fungus, most likely a member of the genus Byssochlamys
(Family Trichocomaceae). The microbial communities at SE
also intermittently contained a population of yeast most closely
related to the genera Saccharomyces and Wickerhamomyces
(Family Saccharomycetaceae) (Figure 2). A summary of all
detected taxa can be found in Supplementary Table S2.
Ordination
based
on
Principal
Coordinates
Analysis
(PCoA) using the weighted UniFrac distance among microbial
communities including both fuel and bioﬁlms indicated that
these communities diﬀered by site (Figure 3). Eukaryotic
samples from SW grouped closely together visually by ordination
compared to those from SE, which clustered more closely by
tank rather than location (Figure 3B). Small diﬀerences were
detected between samples of fuel and bioﬁlm at each sampling
point
among
the
bacteria
(Supplementary Figure S4A),
but there was little to no diﬀerence among the eukarya
(Supplementary Figure S4B).
Site Observations, Biomass, and
Corrosion Measurements
Total dry weight biomass after 12 months of exposure to
fouled fuel was greatest at SW, with SW 2 having the greatest
fouling of coupon surfaces (Supplementary Figure S5). Overall,
coupons at SW were consistently coated in greater amounts of
bioﬁlm/material (Supplementary Figure S6) and had greater
ﬁnal biomass than those sampled at SE.
A total of 242 coupons (including controls) were used in
the analysis of mass loss, and 280 coupons (including controls)
were used for pitting and roughness analyses between bases. The
pitting analyses generated a total of 37,289 measurements from
the 280 coupons and surface roughness analyses generated a
total of 12,810 measurements from the 280 sampled coupons.
Witness coupons from tanks at SW consistently experienced
greater amounts of corrosion than those at SE (Supplementary
Figure S7). All coupons exposed to SW tank systems had
signiﬁcantly more corrosion than controls exposed to sterile fuel.
At SE both SE 3 and SE E had signiﬁcantly more corrosion than
controls while SE 4 coupons were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
sterile fuel controls (Supplementary Table S3). Coupons exposed
to conditions in SW tanks had deeper pits than coupons from the
SE location and controls (Figure 4). Over time, the skewedness
of pit distribution on exposed coupons was greater than the
controls (Figure 4). Surface roughness also increased over time
(Supplementary Figure S8) and was the greatest on coupons
from SW 2. Tanks at SW, and SE 3 had the highest pitting rate
(Table 1). Corrosion rates on the bottom coupons in SW 2 and
SW 4 bottom exceeded 8 MPY. Compared to coupons attached
to the top of the rack, coupons placed at the bottom of tanks
had deeper pits (Figure 4, p < 0.001), but surface roughness was
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p = 0.34, Supplementary Figure S8).
There was little to no eﬀect on load strength, tensile strength, or
elongation among tanks of o-rings exposed to fuel at either the
top or the bottom of the rack (Supplementary Figure S9).
The acidity of fuel in SE 3, measured as acid number, increased
over time from 0.17 to 1.51 mg KOH/g B20. The elevated acidity
corresponded elevated corrosion rates and maximum pit depths
in SE tank 3 relative to other tanks at SE. By 9 months, fuel in SE
tank 3 exceeded the ASTM standard limit of 0.3 mg KOH/g B20
for fuel acidity (Table 2). Witness coupons imaged by SEM from
both bases were covered by morphologically similar bioﬁlms
(Figure 5A), which were primarily comprised of fungal hyphae
(Figure 5C). Pits on the coupon surfaces were correlated with
areas that contained bioﬁlm prior to cleaning (Figures 5B,D).
DISCUSSION
The advantages of blending or replacing ULSD with biodiesel
include increased fuel performance and signiﬁcant reductions
in carbon emissions (Gill et al., 2012). Enhanced fuel standards
have resulted in a worldwide increase in biodiesel consumption
from 2.2 million liters per day (lpd) in 2000 to 84.3 million
lpd in 2014 (Beiter and Tian, 2016). The USAF started using
B20 biodiesel in non-emergency, non-tactical ground vehicles
and consumed 12.1 million liters of biodiesel per year in
2010 (U.S. Air Force Energy Strategic Plan [USAF], 2010).
A potentially signiﬁcant disadvantage to their adoption of B20
biodiesel was an increase in reports of fuel biocontamination.
The main objectives of this study were to characterize the
microbial communities responsible for fouling of B20 biodiesel
and determine whether their proliferation and bioﬁlms are
associated with increased rates of corrosion of in-service
B20 storage tanks.

Microorganisms can more readily metabolize the FAME in
biodiesel blends, leading to fouling in fuel storage systems (Prince
et al., 2008). Fuel fouling and degradation are not the only
concerns, as increased rates of corrosion have been observed
when microorganisms proliferate in biodiesel under laboratory
conditions (Aktas et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010). A recent EPA
study reported moderate or severe corrosion in 83% of inspected
storage tanks (US EPA, 2016), suggesting an additional impact on
fuel infrastructure could be linked to the degradation of biodiesel.
Recent work has identiﬁed the metabolism of microorganisms
in biodiesel blends that results in biodegradation (Bücker et al.,
2018) but microbial communities in non-marine environments
have not yet been directly linked to increased corrosion rates
in situ. In this work, we conducted the ﬁrst longitudinal study
co-locating the microorganisms known to be responsible for fuel
fouling, acid production, and microbially inﬂuenced corrosion
on “witness” coupons installed near the bottom of tanks in situ.
Our study established a link between fuel fouling and increased
bioﬁlm biomass comprised of speciﬁc fungal and bacterial taxa
in operational B20 biodiesel tanks. We also linked biomass
within B20 storage tanks to pitting corrosion, co-located with the
microbial bioﬁlms. The direct linkage between fuel fouling and
corrosion is of considerable concern to tank operations.
The most damaging MIC is associated with multispecies
bioﬁlms, where interactions between diﬀerent microorganisms
can create a cascade of biochemical reactions between the oxic
and anoxic regions (Videla and Characklis, 1992; Little and Lee,
2014). Microbial bioﬁlms and their associated metabolic activities
can exacerbate corrosion via several mechanisms. Under anoxic
conditions and in the presence of oxidized sulfur compounds,
sulfur reducing microorganisms can cause corrosion of iron by
either removing electrons from a hydrogen ﬁlm on the metal
surface (EMIC) or directly from the Fe0 itself (CMIC) (Enning
et al., 2012; Venzlaﬀet al., 2012; Enning and Garrelfs, 2014). Very
little sulfur would be expected in B20 composed of 80% ultralow
sulfur diesel and no sulfate-reducing taxa were detected in our
molecular analyses, supporting the conclusion that any form
of MIC related to anoxic sulfur metabolism was not occurring
in these tanks. Other microorganisms known to participate
in CMIC, such as iron-oxidizing bacteria (e.g., Gallionella sp.,
Leptothrix sp., and Mariprofundus sp.) (McBeth et al., 2011; Lee
et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017) and methanogenic archaea (Enning
et al., 2012) were not detected in bioﬁlm or fuel samples.
Bioﬁlms associated with the greatest amount of MIC
in our study were composed largely of the ﬁlamentous
fungus Byssochlamys sp. and acid-producing bacteria (e.g.,
Gluconacetobacter sp.). The Byssochlamys sp. mycelial hyphae
and the bioﬁlm itself most certainly can facilitate the partitioning
of areas containing dissolved oxygen and anoxic sites, thus
creating an electrochemical oxygen concentration corrosion cell

(Videla and Herrera, 2005; Little et al., 2008). Areas of anoxia
become anodic sites, where aggressive, localized pitting can
occur. Acid production by bacteria and fungi within the bioﬁlm
cane also generate localized areas of low pH, further exacerbating
the solubilization of metal from the surface (Little and Ray, 2001;
Juzeliünas et al., 2007).
We found that the microbial communities forming observable
growth in the B20 tanks contained abundant taxa known to

oxidize the fatty acids or fatty acid methyl esters present in B20
biodiesel. Limitations for growth of bacteria and fungi in B20
is likely controlled by availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, an
electron acceptor, or the presence of water (i.e., physical space
at the fuel-water interface). Bacterial taxa potentially capable of
nitrogen ﬁxation (Nitrospirillum and Burkholderia) were present
and abundant when biomass was high. Both Nitrospirillum and
Burkholderia have the capacity for nitrogen ﬁxation and thus
could be providing the greater microbial community with a
source of ﬁxed nitrogen for growth (Estrada-De Los Santos
et al., 2001; Chung et al., 2015), living in coexistence with
the microorganisms responsible for fuel acidiﬁcation via the
production of organic acids that result in corrosion of metallic
surfaces within the tanks.
Aerobic metabolism at the fuel:water interphase would lead
to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water at the bottom
of storage tanks. In the absence of other electron acceptors,
fermentation would be the main type of microbial metabolism
in the water phase, leading to the production of copious
organic acids. For example, members of the Firmicutes genus
Caproiciproducens were abundant in SW tanks and can produce
numerous organic acids including caproic, butyric, and acetic
acid under anaerobic fermentative growth (Kim et al., 2015).
Anaerobic, fermentative microorganisms like the Clostridiaceae
(including Caproiciproducens), were also abundant at SW in
all three tanks.

corrosion and fouling (Castro et al., 2012; Tazato et al., 2012).
The presence of aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and strictly
anaerobic bacteria in the tanks is indicative of the sharp gradient
in oxygenation. Most likely, the bulk fuel samples taken at the
bottom of storage tanks mixed these microorganisms that were
otherwise segregated by ﬁne scale gradients of oxygenated fuel
and anoxic water.
In contrast to the bacteria, the fungal community was
less diverse and more homogenous across all locations. Fungi
representing a single, highly abundant OTU closely related
to the genus Byssochlamys was found in all tanks exhibiting
fouling. Members of the genus Byssochlamys have been linked

to the contamination of acidic fruit juices and are capable
of propagating across a broad range of pH and temperatures
under oxic conditions (Tournas, 2008). A member of the genus
Byssochlamys was recently isolated from biodiesel in Hawaii, and
characterized for its ability to degrade ULSD and biodiesel (Ye
et al., 2017). Byssochlamys spores can withstand boiling (high
temperatures are a part of the biodiesel production process),
low concentrations of oxygen that may exist at the bottom
of a fuel tank, and pH values as low as 3.5 as microbial
community members begin to acidify water at the bottom
of a fuel tank (Tournas, 2008). Additionally, members of the
anamorph of Byssochlamys, Paecilomyces, are known to ferment
under anaerobic conditions, producing acetate and ethanol
(Mountfort and Rhodes, 1991). Unclassiﬁed Eurotiomycetes
(identiﬁed as Byssochlamys) was numerically dominant in all
tanks at SW over time with much lower observable diversity
than the Bacteria. The abundance of these fungi likely contributes
to the increased acidity observed in tanks at SE as well as to
the acidiﬁcation and fouling of fuels at SW. Filamentous fungi
such as Byssochlamys may also provide a surface for bacteria to
exploit, encouraging bioﬁlm production in fuel (Guennoc et al.,
2017). SEM analysis of fouled coupons showed co-location of
rod-shaped bacteria with the fungal ﬁlaments (data not shown).
Ours is the ﬁrst study to conclusively show the biocontamination
of B20 biodiesel in situ dominated by Byssochlamys-like OTUs,
and to establish the relationship between their abundance and
in situ corrosion.
Major diﬀerences in community membership were detected
between locations and among individual tanks. However, there
was no obvious correlation between community membership
and environmental (local temperature or rainfall) or operational
variables. As a result, we do not have deﬁnitive evidence as
to why speciﬁc microorganisms were associated with a single
tank or location. Tank material almost certainly was a factor –
corroding steel tanks represent a more reducing environment
than the relatively more inert ﬁberglass tanks, encouraging the
growth of anaerobic microorganisms such as Caproiciproducens
as observed in SW. The tank SW 2 had the greatest amount of
corrosion, although another steel tank, SE E, produced much
lower amounts of corrosion suggesting that something more than
tank material may play a role in the corrosion rate and microbial
communities observed.
The data presented in this study highlights the spatial
heterogeneity of microbial communities within B20 storage
tanks. Most of the detected taxa were found in similar relative
abundances both in the top and bottom of each sampled
coupon rack, suggesting there is little diﬀerence in the microbial
communities that occur within these areas of each tank. The
greatest diﬀerences were observed in SW 2, where diﬀerences in
the relative abundances of the Clostridium sensu strictu 12 and
unclassiﬁed Acetobacteraceae were noted both over time, and in
position within the tank. This could be due to a decrease in the
amount of dissolved oxygen both in the fuel and water bottom;
OTUs related to Clostridium (strict anaerobic microorganisms)
increased over time in the upper position while the Unclassiﬁed
Acetobacterace decreased. Because each storage tank was in
operation while it was being monitored, it is also possible that
there was a mixing eﬀect on the community as fuel and water
levels changed over time, making it diﬃcult to discern diﬀerences
in community structure between locations in each tank. Shared
among all of the sampled tanks, was the presence of a mixed
microbial community of both fungi and bacteria that appeared
capable of fermentation and the production of organic acids that
would increase localized corrosion on metallic surfaces.
The corrosion measured in this study likely resulted from
the presence of microbial bioﬁlms causing localized pitting
corrosion. The localized production of acids within bioﬁlms
created an environment that was favorable for the induction
of pitting corrosion similar to that observed within our study
(Lee et al., 2010). Our in situ study showed greater corrosion
near the bottom of each tank where the presence of water and
a fuel-water interface was more likely. The interaction of fuel
and water allows for enhanced microbial growth, and in turn,
greater corrosion than water limited spaces within a fuel tank.
Indeed, the greatest corrosion rates observed were in tanks at
SW (>8 MPY), where fungal fouling was the most proliﬁc.
Rates of corrosion appeared to decline from 7 to 12 months,
suggesting passivation may have taken place. Alternatively, the
apparent shallowing of pits could be explained by an increase in
uniform corrosion, that was observed in SW tanks, which could
make pits appear shallower. The exact mechanism of corrosion
remains to be deciphered – while steel corrosion is commonly
associated with sulfate reduction and the production of sulﬁde
(Lee et al., 2009), no sulfate reducing bacteria were identiﬁed
within any of the community surveys. The greatest levels of
corrosion observed in the SW tanks correlated with the presence
of anaerobic Clostridia and high relative abundances of OTUs
most closely related to Byssochlamys, suggesting that corrosion
in these tanks was the result of the production of organic
acids during the metabolism (either fermentative or aerobic)
of FAMEs present within B20. The presence of organic acids
produced as a consequence of fuel degradation may also aide in
further growth of organisms that can directly incorporate these
metabolites into their own cell wall, as was recently observed in
an alkane degrading culture (Konieczna et al., 2018). Although we
observed biomass including both bacterial and fungi on polymer
coated coupons and polymeric O-rings that could degrade or
otherwise damage materials (Cregut et al., 2013; Hung et al.,
2016), polymer degradation was not detected. It is possible that
the polymers tested in this study were resistant to degradation
over the period of the study and that a much longer exposure time
was required. Our data supports the idea that tank contamination

contributes to an increased risk of corrosion but not, apparently,
to polymeric degradation.
We can only speculate how the fuel storage tanks became
contaminated. All of the tanks sampled, with the exception
of SE E, were cleaned just prior to the beginning of in situ
measurements. Within 6 months, however, a dense fungal
mat was visible on coupons removed from many of the tanks.
Spores of Byssochlamys may enter through the vents from
wind-blown dust or enter as a part of the fuel production process
in otherwise “clean” fuel. Nevertheless, bioﬁlms were repeatedly
found on the in situ coupons and sampling racks near the
bottom of each tank in a relatively rapid timeframe. It is highly
likely that after a tank is colonized, the established community
of the tank is the likely source of recurrent contamination,

CONCLUSION
The
comprehensive,

investigation
presented
here
compliments several other laboratory-based studies (Leung
et al., 2006; Bucker et al., 2011; Ching et al., 2016). Together,
they illustrate the susceptibility of fuels containing biodiesel to
microbial proliferation (fouling), fuel biodegradation, and MIC
of associated infrastructure. Here though, we were able to directly
link the presence and prevalence of bioﬁlms to pitting corrosion
in actively operating B20 storage tanks. We found that a mixed
microbial community of ﬁlamentous fungi and acid-producing
bacteria were able to proliferate in B20 biodiesel storage
tanks, cause fouling, degrade fuel by metabolizing the FAME,
produce organic acids, and accelerate steel corrosion under
bioﬁlms attached to metal surfaces. The same fungal species
was responsible for “blooms” of biomass, providing a target for
future mitigation strategies. Additional research is underway
to characterize this most abundant fungal member of fuels and
bioﬁlms observed at both locations (Stamps et al., 2018).
Despite the trade-oﬀs in fuel stability due to susceptibility
to microbial attack, biodiesel continues to be the most
common and economical solution to reduce the environmental
impact of petroleum diesel combustion. As such, the use
of biodiesel will likely continue to increase worldwide for
the foreseeable future. Operator vigilance in fuel quality and
storage conditions is required including early mitigation through
water removal, cleaning, and even biocide treatment. Each
of these methods would likely be the most eﬀective means
of controlling fouling, degradation, and corrosion through
the prevention of microbial bioﬁlm establishment. While B20
