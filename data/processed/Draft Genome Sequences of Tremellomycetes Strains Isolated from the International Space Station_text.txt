ABSTRACT
The draft genome sequences of six eukaryotic microbial strains belong-
ing to the class Tremellomycetes isolated from the International Space Station were
assembled. Further characterization of these sequences will aid in the understanding
of the inﬂuence of microgravity conditions on these organisms’ potential pathoge-
nicity.
I
n an ongoing microbial observatory experiment on the International Space Station
(ISS), species belonging to the class Tremellomycetes were identiﬁed (1). This class
comprises yeasts, dimorphic fungi, and organisms that form hyphae or complex fruiting
bodies (2). In this class, the genera Naganishia and Papiliotrema were amended to
accommodate the Cryptococcus albidus clade and a few other Cryptococcus species,
respectively (3). Among the Cryptococcus species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryp-
tococcus gattii are the most common human pathogens; however, recently, there has
been an increase in infections caused by non-neoformans Cryptococcus species (4–8).
This report presents the draft genome assemblies of four such non-neoformans Cryp-
tococcus species, enabling the identiﬁcation of genetic determinants responsible for
their potential pathogenicity under the inﬂuence of microgravity compared to their
ground controls.
In this study, the draft genome sequences of six strains belonging to the class
Tremellomycetes isolated from the ISS were determined (1). Descriptions of the sample
collection, processing, and presumptive identiﬁcation of these isolates were published
elsewhere (1). Brieﬂy, samples collected from the ISS were processed, and 100 l of
each dilution was plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) with 100 g/ml chloram-
phenicol. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 7 days. The single colony obtained was
restreaked onto PDA plates and incubated at 25°C for 3 days, and a biomass of
approximately 1 g wet weight was collected and pooled for DNA extraction. Total
nucleic acid extraction was carried out using a ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit
(Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using a Bertin Precellys
homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera
Flex protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial
amount of DNA for library preparation was quantiﬁed, and depending on the input
DNA concentration, 5 to 12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output.
The ampliﬁed genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in a 384-plex
conﬁguration. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq
6000 S4 ﬂow cell paired-end (PE) 2  150-bp platform with a paired-end module.
The data were ﬁltered with the NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (9) for high-quality (HQ) vector-
and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff
quality score, 20). The numbers of ﬁltered reads obtained are listed in Table 1, and
they were used for assembly with the SPAdes v3.14.1 (10) genome assembler (k-mer

size, 32 to 72 bases). Default parameters were used for all software. The details of
the ﬁnal assembly are summarized in Table 1.
The species were identiﬁed based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences
extracted from the assembled genomes. The ITS sequence of Naganishia sp. strain
IF7SW-B1 retrieved from the assembled genome did not show 98% identity to any
Naganishia species and, therefore, requires taxonomic characterization. Isolation of
Naganishia and Papiliotrema species from the ISS is signiﬁcant, and their persistence
during space ﬂight needs to be further studied.
Data availability. The whole-genome sequences and raw data have been depos-
ited in GenBank under the BioProject accession number PRJNA623412. This project has
also been deposited in the NASA GeneLab system (GLDS-290; https://genelab-data.ndc
.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-290). The version described in this paper is the ﬁrst
version.
