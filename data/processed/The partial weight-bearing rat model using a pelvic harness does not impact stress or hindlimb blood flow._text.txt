Rehabilitation and Build Athlete Resiliency
Mark Murphy, P.T., D.P.T., S.C.S., C.S.C.S.
Abstract: Blood ﬂow restriction training (BFRT) is a tool utilized in rehabilitation and injury prevention to improve
muscle strength and size, particularly in load-compromised individuals. BFRT facilitates gains in muscular strength and
hypertrophy at lower loads, allowing for accelerated recovery and less disuse atrophy. BFRT must be applied appropriately
and with caution, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular concerns. There are applications for BFRT across a wide
spectrum of human performance training and in rehabilitation of both lower and upper extremity conditions, providing a
high-quality adjunct to improve muscle strength, power, and endurance. Level of Evidence: Level V, expert opinion.

ehabilitation and injury prevention programs are
constantly seeking ways to create an environment
of progressive overload to produce more resilient,
physically prepared individuals. This is particularly true
in the athletic population. Athletes are frequently
confronted with complicating factors both internal and
external that make traditional progressive loading
methods
problematic
or
counterproductive.
These
include underlying concomitant conditions, chronic
orthopaedic issues, acute tissue healing timelines, or
even previous acute workloads that can create situa-
tions where they lack the structural and functional
tolerance for an intensiﬁcation in loading during
training and rehabilitation.
Instead of constantly seeking progressive overload
with an athlete during every session, the goal should be
creating a progressive training stimulus within each
interaction. Because the time in any athletic career is
ﬁnite, the most needs to be made of each training ses-
sion the athlete has available to them. The objective of
rehabilitation and injury prevention is to gradually
improve the structural and functional capabilities of the
individual, allowing them the capacity to handle the
demands of their tasks in their emergent environment.
Blood ﬂow restriction training (BFRT) provides the
practitioner with the means to produce progressive
stimulus to foster improvements in the structural and
functional capabilities of load-compromised individuals.
The purpose of this article is to explore the basic
sciences,
safety/contraindications,
application,
and
utility of BFRT in rehabilitation and injury prevention.
Conventional Pathways to Strength and
Hypertrophy
Progressive overload is a resistance training principle
that hinges on gradually increasing the load the athlete
is training under to drive the intended training stim-
ulus.1 One of the stimuli most frequently driven
through resistance training is increasing muscle hy-
pertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy is viewed as a founda-
tional performance factor as the force a muscle can
create
is
proportional
to
the
physiological
cross-
sectional area (PCSA) of that muscle.2,3 Resistance
training has been shown to have a positive effect on
increasing PCSA of muscles.4,5 A progressive training
stimulus capable of producing muscle hypertrophy can
still be achieved by manipulating program variables
other than load.6 Increasing PCSA through muscle
hypertrophy is a foundational performance precursor to
the
expression
of
maximal
strength
and
power.
Expression of maximal strength and power is heavily
inﬂuenced by both inter- and intramuscular coordina-
tion as well as the speciﬁcity of the training in which
the athlete participates.7,8 There may be no greater
modiﬁable variable in injury prevention and rehabili-
tation
than

hypertrophy of an athlete, and BFRT provides practi-
tioners with a valuable tool to improve muscular
strength and foster hypertrophy.9
The primary pathways to achieve muscle hypertrophy
are metabolic stress, muscle damage, and mechanical
tension.6,10,11 Metabolic stress is the by-product of
metabolites produced through anerobic glycolysis when
engaging
in
glycolytic
training.
These
metabolites
include lactate, hydrogen ions, inorganic phosphate,
and creatine. This metabolite accumulation is thought
to be a mediator of the hypertrophic response speciﬁc to
resistance training.10 Exercise stress creates a hypoxic
environment that decreases pH while increasing con-
centrations of hydrogen ions, CO2, lactate, calcium, and
reactive oxygen species. This combination results in
increasing
the
release
of
myokines
and
cellular
mechanotransduction to accommodate to cell swelling
during loaded exercise, thereby furthering an increase
in systemic anabolic signaling.10,12,13 Muscle damage in
the form of the deformation of the myoﬁbrils through
training produces an acute inﬂammatory response
where, once the damage is perceived by the body, there
is a hormonal response of various growth factors,
leading to satellite cell proliferation, tissue repair, and
muscle growth.10,14,15 Mechanical tension is produced
by force generation and stretching the muscle in a
lengthened position, which increases as the load in-
creases, resulting in a rise of type II muscle ﬁber
recruitment to execute the task.10,11
This pursuit of type II muscle ﬁber activation is a
primary rationale for the production of mechanical
tension in resistance training. Conventionally, the
pathway to improving hypertrophy is by using loads
>60% of the 1-repetition max (1RM) with 8 to 12
repetitions per set, or strength 80% to 100% of 1RM
with 1 to 5 repetitions per set.16 However, muscle hy-
pertrophy and activation of type II muscle ﬁbers have
been shown to be equally achieved across a variety of
loading parameters, such as 30% to 80% of 1RM with a
consistent theme of training to volitional fatigue.11,16-18
Athletes who are load compromised secondary to
structural or functional constraints may not tolerate
heavy loads well and may need to use an alternative
mode of exercise to elicit metabolic stress, muscle
damage, and mechanical tension to stimulate the
appropriate skeletal muscle response to resistance ex-
ercise and induce anabolism. BFRT is a modality that is
capable of achieving these results in load-compromised
individuals.
Basic Sciences
BFRT is a method of training that has utility in both
rehabilitation and performance. It has been shown to
elicit gains in strength and hypertrophy at signiﬁcantly
lower loads (<30% of estimated 1RM).12,19 BFRT
presents the practitioner with a method to elicit
improvements in strength and hypertrophy in load-
compromised individuals to accelerate recovery and
mitigate disuse atrophy.20 BFRT has also been shown to
have beneﬁts for cardiovascular ﬁtness, pain attenua-
tion, and improvements in bone density (Table 1).21
The use of restricting proximal blood ﬂow during ex-
ercise, or Kaatsu training, was ﬁrst introduced in the
1960s by Dr. Yoshiaki Sato.22
The application of BFRT involves using either a
pneumatic tourniquet system or a tourniquet cuff that
is placed as proximal to the working limb as possible
to mitigate compression of neurovascular structures
around bony prominences.23 Vascular structures un-
der the tourniquet/cuff system are occluded with the
intent to restrict venous return of blood ﬂow and
partially restrict
arterial inﬂow within a working
muscle. The decrease in venous outﬂow has been
shown
to
lead
to
blood
pooling
and

accumulation, while the decrease in arterial inﬂow
leads to a decrease in oxygen to the working tissue,
further exacerbating fatigue through the creation of a
hypoxic environment.20
The use of BFRT enables the athlete to train at lighter
loads while still achieving metabolic stress. This process
is further enhanced by a combination of occlusion,
muscle damage from the task of exercising, and me-
chanical tension secondary to training to volitional
fatigue in a hypoxic environment.12 This leads to an
increase
in
metabolic
stress
through
metabolite
accumulation and is thought to facilitate signaling of
hypertrophic
pathways
and
increase
motor
unit
recruitment of type II muscle ﬁbers due to an earlier
onset of fatigue.21 It is important to note that there is a
summation of type II muscle ﬁbers both proximal and
distal to the cuff when BFRT is utilized.12,21 The ratio-
nale for the increase in muscle activation proximal to
the placement of the cuff is recruitment of more
proximal synergistic muscles later in the set when the
distally occluded muscles are approaching volitional
fatigue.24 Additionally, gains in the contralateral ex-
tremity have also been shown after completing BFRT,
suggesting
systemic
effects
when
appropriately
utilized.25
BFRT training and low-intensity exercise are hy-
pothesized to induce anabolism through metabolite
accumulation via metabolic stress, leading to cell
swelling.21 This cell swelling distal to the cuff is
thought to further propagate intracellular hypoxia,
leading
to
anabolic
and
inﬂammatory
signaling
mechanisms.17,19 Additionally, there is an increase in
systemic anabolic signaling from the distal metabolite
accumulation and proximally via downstream fatigue
of the proximal musculature to accommodate for the
workload.12 The conﬂuence of both the proximal and
distal response to occlusion while exercising leads to a
local and systemic anabolic signaling of an increase in
growth
hormone,
insulin-like
growth
factor
1,
vascular endothelial growth factor, myogenic stem
cells, and muscle protein synthesis via mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
complex
1emediated
anabo-
lism.12,17,26,27 Insulin-like growth factor 1 plays a vital
role in muscle hypertrophy by facilitating muscle
protein synthesis through satellite cell proliferation
and suppressing myostatin, which is a known negative
regulator of muscle and bone anabolism.12,14,15,28
Suppressed anabolic signaling has been shown to be
present in individuals who may be inactive secondary
to being load compromised or immobilized, which can
contribute to a further decline in muscle mass.29,30
PCSA is proportional to the force-generating capacity
of the muscle, and disuse can lead to atrophy, which
can reduce the PCSA of a muscle.2,3 Muscle hyper-
trophy is a foundational performance factor in the
expression of strength and power. In rehabilitation
and sports performance, atrophy must be mitigated
and hypertrophy prioritized to successfully improve
athletic strength, power, and endurance. The mecha-
nisms produced using BFRT can be extremely useful
in facilitating this process.
Safety and Contraindications
Prior to utilizing BFRT, it is the responsibility of the
practitioner
to
be
familiar
with
the
physiological
mechanisms, proper application, pathoanatomic pre-
cautions, and pathoanatomic contraindications of the
modality.17,31,32 The author recommends that those
looking to use BFRT in practice seek additional training
beyond their traditional schooling to better provide the
intervention safely and effectively.
Contraindications for the use of BFRT are centered
on cardiovascular issues and include but are not
limited to a history of or potential for a deep vein
thrombosis/embolism, history of rhabdomyolysis, poor
circulation,
varicose
veins,
history
of
endothelial
dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, easy
bruising, active infection, cancer, lymphedema, renal
compromise, pregnancy, use of medications that in-
crease the risk of clotting, open wounds, presence of a
tumor, sickle cell anemia, acidosis, the presence of a
dialysis
port,
open
fracture,
increased
intracranial
pressure
vascular
grafts,
lymphadenectomy,
and
intolerance to the intervention.17,20,24,26,33 It is inter-
esting to note that previous studies have examined
the incidence of deep vein thrombosis while utilizing
BFRT and found it to be <0.06%; likewise, the inci-
dence of pulmonary embolism was
found to be
<0.01% and the reported instances of rhabdomyolysis
after BFRT 0.008%.34,35
The previous list of contraindications should not be
viewed as absolute or comprehensive. All individuals
should be appropriately screened before any imple-
mentation of BFRT. Those at the greatest risk of an
adverse reaction from BFRT are those with a poor
circulatory system, obesity, sickle cell trait, severe
hypertension, renal compromise, diabetes, or arterial
calciﬁcation.33 Potential adverse side effects to BFRT
include but are not limited to pain or discomfort,
delayed-onset muscle soreness, cardiac stress, numb-
ness or nerve injury, bruising or ischemic injury,
dizziness, fainting, muscle damage, thrombus forma-
tion, and rhabdomyolysis.17,20,35,36 Clinical prediction
rules, such as the Wells criteria, can be used to help
practitioners assess the probability of venous throm-
boembolism in at-risk individuals.20,37-39 Nascimento
et al.31 created a comprehensive screening tool that
provides practitioners with a risk stratiﬁcation speciﬁc
to the use of BFRT. Practitioners should use their
clinical judgment and knowledge of risk factors before
implementing any BFRT intervention, and additional

BFRT-speciﬁc training is recommended to ensure the
safe and effective use of the intervention.
Application
BFRT is classically completed with low-load resistance
training at 20% to 40% of estimated 1RM with and
without neuromuscular electrical stimulation.21,23,40 It
can also be used with traditional high-load resistance
training (>60% of estimated 1RM), in aerobic exercise
(AE) at <45% of estimated maximal oxygen con-
sumption (VO2 max), and in passive cell-swelling pro-
tocols.21,23,40 The commonality between each mode of
BFRT is as a method to mitigate atrophy and serve as a
means of additional training volume at a decreased
intensity or an additional stimulus for hypertrophy in
load-compromised individuals.
Regardless of the mode of intervention, a pneumatic
tourniquet system or tourniquet cuff is placed proxi-
mally on the working limb(s) to allow occlusion to
occur
in
the
associated
musculature.17,20,35
The
placement of the cuff should be as proximal on the
working limb as possible to target the whole muscle
group, allow for a full range of motion during exer-
cise,
and
mitigate
any
risk
of
superﬁcial
nerve
compression.17,34,41 The use of a barrier between the
skin and the cuff has also been recommended to
mitigate
any
risk
of
superﬁcial
skin
breakdown
secondary to friction.36 Before beginning BFRT, it is
imperative
to
standardize
limb
occlusion
pressure
(LOP) speciﬁc to both the individual using the device
and the position in which they will be exercising.
Factors inﬂuencing LOP are cuff width, cuff material,
cuff shape, limb circumference, limb characteristics,
resting blood pressure, limb temperature, and position
of the individual.17,19,23,41 Use of a wider BFRT cuff
has been shown to require lower pressure required to
occlude the limb and produce fewer subjective reports
of local discomfort.24,41
When selecting LOP, a recommendation of 40% to
80% of arterial occlusion pressure is suggested in the
lower extremities (LEs) while up to 60% is advised
the upper extremities (UEs).20,21,24 The pressure uti-
lized during BFRT should be low enough to preserve
arterial inﬂow but high enough to occlude venous
return in the working muscles.41,42 Distal pulses must
always be palpated when identifying LOP regardless of
the type of equipment being used.17 In any training
intervention, reproducibility and safety are of the
utmost importance, and BFRT is no exception. The
gold standard is the use of a personalized tourniquet
system with dynamic capabilities that can maintain
and regulate a speciﬁed LOP pressure based on pres-
sure ﬂuctuations during movement. In the event this
type of system is not available, LOP can also be
determined
using
a
manually
inﬂated
cuff
and
Doppler ultrasound.
BFRT in Rehabilitation, Recovery, and
Performance
Traditionally, the use of low-load (LL) BFRT has been
popular with load-compromised individuals. Acute
program variables for LL BFRT include an overall fre-
quency of 2 to 3 times a week, performed at 20% to
40% of estimated 1RM, for 5 to 10 minutes per exercise
with reperfusion in between exercises.17,20,21 In this
structure, there are 2 to 4 sets, with a 30- to 60-second
rest period between sets, using a repetition scheme
totaling 75 repetitions divided into the 4 sets in a 30-15-
15-15 fashion or to volitional fatigue (Fig 1).17,20,21
LL BFRT has been shown to be an effective modality
in postoperative anterior cruciate ligament, Achilles
tendon, total knee arthroplasty, knee arthroscopy, and
quadriceps tendon rehabilitation as an early muscular
training tool, improving strength, preserving LE bone
mass, and mitigating atrophy.33,43-46 Additional studies
have compared the effectiveness of traditional heavy-
load resistance training and LL BFRT in the post-
surgical rehabilitation of anterior cruciate ligament re-
constructions, ﬁnding that LL BFRT can improve
skeletal muscle hypertrophy and LE strength at similar
levels of traditional heavy-load resistance training, with
less joint pain and effusion.47-49
LL BFRT has demonstrated utility in the rehabilitation
and management of both operative and nonoperative
UE injuries such as shoulder stabilization procedures,
pectoralis major tendon repairs, lateral elbow tendin-
opathy, rotator cuff injuries, distal radius fractures, and
shoulder instability.50-57 LL BFRT has been shown to
elicit changes in strength and hypertrophy both prox-
imal and distal to the cuff in the UE.25,50,51 Changes in
strength and hypertrophy proximal to the cuff are
thought to occur due to training to volitional fatigue,
bringing about synergistic involvement of the proximal
muscle groups.51,54,58 LL BFRT in the UE appears to
provide a greater increase in muscle strength and size
than low-load resistance training alone.54 Utilizing LL
BFRT in individuals with a load-compromised UE ap-
pears to be an appropriate training stimulus to improve
strength and hypertrophy. Further research in the area
of BFRT and its effects on the UE can be of beneﬁt as
there is variance in the literature, particularly in regard
to protocol standardization.51 Additionally, it is worth
noting that there is a scarcity of studies on the use of
BFRT in healthy tendons and in the management of
tendon pathology for both the UE and LE. Integrating
LL BFRT may have utility as an adjunctive loading
scheme in the acute phases of tendinopathy manage-
ment
when
traditional
heavy
loads
may
not
be
tolerable.59

M. MURPHY

There is consistent evidence in the literature that LL
BFRT produces more signiﬁcant improvements in
muscle strength and hypertrophy in the UE and LE
when compared to traditional low-load resistance
training in healthy individuals.54,60 LL BFRT has been
shown to be as effective at improving strength and
hypertrophy in healthy individuals when compared to
heavy-load strength training.61-63 This demonstrates
that LL BFRT is indeed a valuable tool when seeking a
progressive training stimulus in load-compromised in-
dividuals or in otherwise healthy well-trained athletes
requiring supplemental hypertrophy in targeted muscle
groups who would not normally beneﬁt from using low
loads alone.19,64,65
Since PCSA of a muscle is a foundational performance
factor for the expression of strength and power, it is
interesting to note that a number of key sports perfor-
mance indicators have been shown to improve through
the addition of BFRT in healthy trained athletes,
including 10-m, 30-m, and 40-m sprint times; counter-
movement jump power; muscular endurance; 5-0-5
agility test; 20-m shuttle run test; 1 RM bench press; 1
RM squat; isokinetic strength of the knee ﬂexors/ex-
tensors; cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscle;
and expression of isometric strength.19,63,66-76 It is
important to note there is variance in these studies in
terms of effect size, exercise protocol, duration of
training regime, intensity of loading, and LOP utilized.
The implementation of BFRT alongside a traditional
heavy resistance training program can be used as a
progressive stimulus in either chronically or acutely
load-compromised individuals and otherwise healthy
athletes to continue to drive muscular hypertrophy and
elicit improvements in conventional sport performance
tests (Fig 2, Video 1).19,54,60-63,77,78
Aerobic ﬁtness is a foundational performance factor
to the repeated expression of strength and power and a
marker of general health. A model of exercise pre-
scription for BFRT with AE is utilization 2 to 3 times a
week at an intensity of <50% of VO2 max or heart rate
reserves, an occlusion time of 5 to 10 minutes, and a
mode of exercise of either cycling or walking.17,20,78
Blood ﬂow restriction (BFR) with AE has demon-
strated signiﬁcant improvements in aerobic capacity
(AC) when compared to low- to moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise without BFR.75,78 When comparing
high-intensity (>90% of VO2 max) AE with and
without
BFRT,
there
is
minimal
difference
in
improvement in AC.78,79 However, there is signiﬁcant
improvement in anaerobic capacity and power without
compromising maximal AC, suggesting the improve-
ments in BFRT training with high-intensity AE are
muscular rather than cardiovascular in nature.79,80 This
suggests
that
BFRT
affords
a
more
efﬁcient
and
alternative avenue to improve AC at lower intensities
utilizing novel training stimuli in the pursuit of im-
provements in anaerobic outputs at higher intensities.81
BFRT without additional exercise or passive BFRT is
another mode of BFRT used in individuals who are
encountering prolonged periods of immobilization,
leading to large deﬁcits in functional mobility and at-
rophy.21,77 The induced cell-swelling in passive BFRT
has been shown to facilitate the accumulation of me-
tabolites
and
anabolic
signaling.77,82

parameters for passive BFR or cell-swelling protocol
utilize a LOP of 70% to 100% for 5 minutes and then 3
minutes of reperfusion with a frequency of 3 to 4 sets
per session with a maximum occlusion time of 20 mi-
nutes, once to twice a day.20,40,83
Another application of passive BFRT is ischemic pre-
conditioning (IPC). This is a tool to enhance the re-
covery process, which has been shown to attenuate the
markers of exercise-induced muscle damage.84 IPC has
potential usages in application before and/or after
strenuous exercise to help expedite recovery and
restore contractile properties of the tissues after activity
or prime the tissues before engaging in the task.84-86
IPC
after
eccentric
exercise
has
been
shown
to
decrease markers of exercise-induced muscle damage,
reduce overall soreness, and enhance postexercise
muscle performance.87,88 IPC could serve as a tool to
optimize athlete readiness and availability as a priming
tool before participation in sport or training and/or as a
recovery method after an exposure to sport/training.
Conclusions
BFRT has applications across the continuum of hu-
man performance, from immobilization, early rehabil-
itation with low loads, low-intensity aerobic exercises,
as part of a comprehensive strength and conditioning
plan, and in recovery. The use of conventional strength
training is strongly supported along with the inclusion
of BFRT as an adjunct in the otherwise healthy popu-
lation to optimize mechanical tension, muscle damage,
and metabolic stress to drive muscle growth. It is our
role
as
performance
coaches
and
rehabilitation
providers to restore, reﬁne, and prepare the relevant
structural and functional qualities of the individual for
the task in which they will be participating. Muscular
hypertrophy is a foundational performance precursor to
be able to express and withstand the biomotor, senso-
rimotor, and bioenergetic demands of sport. BFRT is a
progressive training stimulus that can be incorporated
across a variety of populations, in number of applica-
tions, to produce a more resilient individual.
