Osteoporosis can profoundly aﬀect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause
similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of
gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated
(total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy 137Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed
tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient
microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months). Ex vivo bone cell
diﬀerentiation from the marrow was unaﬀected by gamma radiation. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy
(but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior
to the onset of age-related osteoporosis.
1. Introduction
Osteoporosis can lead to devastating health consequences
and poses a substantial health care burden currently aﬀecting
an estimated 44 million Americans (NIH). In women, estro-
gen deﬁciency is primarily responsible for the rapid postme-
nopausal loss of bone mass and resulting structural fragility
(type I osteoporosis) while a slower bone loss (type II or se-
nile osteoporosis) aﬀects both men and women late in life
[1]. Bone structure begins to decline early [2]; peak bone
mass is achieved in early adulthood and progressively dec-
lines in both high turnover, cancellous tissue and in the
surrounding hard cortical shell. The compartments of bone
aﬀected by osteoporosis can include both the dense tissue
that forms an outer structural shell (cortical bone) and the
spongy tissue (cancellous bone) within the marrow cavity;
the microarchitecture of cancellous bone is profoundly
aﬀected in osteoporosis and renders sites that are rich in can-
cellous tissue, such as the spine and proximal femur, prone to
fracture. An age-related decline in cancellous tissue structure
occurs in rodents over a matter of months, rather than years,
as in humans. C57BL/6J mice provide a well-established ani-
mal model with relatively rapid postpubertal loss of cancel-
lous tissue [3, 4], characteristic of that which precedes the
development of senile, type II osteoporosis in humans.
Bone turnover is regulated by a balance between the ac-
tivities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing os-
teoclasts. Osteoblasts progressively diﬀerentiate from pro-
genitors and mesenchymal stem cells whereas osteoclasts are
haematopoietic derivatives of the monocyte/macrophage lin-
eage. Stem cells, progenitors, and precursors of both lineages
reside within the bone marrow. Bone marrow cells cultured
ex vivo retain behavioral characteristics of in vivo function;
thus bone marrow-derived cells cultured under conditions
tailored either to stimulate osteoblast diﬀerentiation (osteo-
blastogenesis) or osteoclast diﬀerentiation (osteoclastogene-
sis) are useful tools to dissect cellular and molecular bases of
physiological challenges such as skeletal aging and exposure
to radiation [5–8].

Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen
species (ROS/RNS) both by the ionization of target mol-
ecules and by perturbations to the cellular redox state, also
implicated in the development of osteoporosis [9–12]. The
production of ROS/RNS causes oxidative damage to DNA,
lipids, and protein inﬂuencing key cell functions, including
proliferation, diﬀerentiation, and apoptosis. Low Linear En-
ergy Transfer (LET) ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma rays,
X-rays) at high cumulative doses (>200 cGy) can damage
vascular supply (osteoradionecrosis), leading to loss of cor-
tical and cancellous tissue and leading to skeletal fragility
[13], while adverse eﬀects of lower doses (100–200 cGy) ap-
pear to be conﬁned to cancellous tissue in animal models
[12, 14–16]. Much less is known about how low doses in-
ﬂuence skeletal health.
Here we hypothesized that low-to-moderate doses of ion-
izing radiation accelerate postpubertal and progressive loss
of microarchitectural integrity over time. Ionizing radiation
at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) caused structural
changes in cancellous tissue within one month that occurred
over 4 months in controls, with no further decrements fol-
lowing 1 month. The capability of marrow-derived cell pop-
ulations to diﬀerentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts was
unaﬀected.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Experiment Design. A total of 96 C57BL/6J 10-week old
male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were
housed 2/cage for up to 4 months. This age and duration of
the experiment were selected on the basis of results reported
by others, showing that this encompasses a period of micro-
architectural changes that are associated with osteopenia (re-
duced bone density) over time [3, 4]. Mice were provided
food (LabDiet 5001, Purina Mills, Gray Summit, MO) and
water ad libitum. After three days of cage acclimation, un-
anesthetized mice (4 per exposure) were irradiated (IR; JL
Shepherd Mark I, 137Cs gamma ray source, San Gabriel, CA)
with 1, 10, or 100 cGy at 0.96, 0.96, or 88 cGy/min (±10%),
respectively, or were sham-irradiated (0 cGy-controls). The
exposure ﬁeld was 26.5 × 19.5 cm2. To expose samples evenly,
mice were placed in container (10 cm radius), centered 18 cm
from the source, and rotated at 6 rpm. Radiation dose and
uniformity was calibrated in air by JL Shepherd & Asso-
ciates using an X-ray Monitor (no. 2025, MDH Industries,
Monrovia, CA) with a 0.18 cm3 probe (National Institutes of
Standards and Technology traceable). Tissues were harvested
on the day of IR (basal) or 1 or 4 months later (n = 8/group),
with cell culture being performed at the latter two endpoints.
As an indicator of health, total body mass was measured
(E0D120 scale, Ohaus Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) at least
once per week until tissue harvest. The Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of NASA Ames Research Center
approved all procedures.
2.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture. Skeletal microarchitecture
broadly characterizes the 3D network of cancellous (or
spongy) bone. Microcomputed tomography (vivaCT 40,
SCANCO Medical AG, Br¨uttisellen, Switzerland) allows
direct quantiﬁcation of the microarchitecture of mineralized
tissue (10.5 μm voxel size) within the proximal tibia meta-
physis [17]. Standard indices [18] were generated within the
excised right tibia in a region 0.2 to 1.2 mm distal to the
proximal growth plate via semiautonomous contouring of
cross-sectional slices, as reported in detail previously [15].
The relative amount of bone to total volume (BV/TV, bone
volume fraction) quantiﬁes the amount of bone present. The
thickness of the bony struts, the thickness (or spacing) of the
marrow voids, and trabecular number characterize trabecu-
lar morphologys on average [19]. Connectivity density quan-
tiﬁes the number of trabecular struts per volume in the bony
network [20]. The structure model index measures the ratio
of rod-like (=3) to plate-like (=0) trabeculae within the tissue
[19]. The fabric tensor quantiﬁes the anisotropic orientation
of the structure, relating to mechanical properties [21, 22],
with three eigenvalues describing the axial lengths of the
anisotropy ellipsoid and the degree of anisotropy equaling
the ratio of the maximum to minimum eigenvalues.
2.3. Primary Bone Marrow Culture. Marrow cells from the
hindlimbs (femora and tibiae) were grown as previously de-
scribed [7]. In brief, cells were ﬂushed from the bone mar-
row and plated in α-MEM supplemented with 15% fetal
calf serum with osteoblastogenic supplements (ascorbate
50 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and β-glycero-
phosphate (10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For os-
teoclastogenesis, cells were plated overnight in macrophage
colony stimulating factor (MCSF, 30 ng/mL, R&D Systems
Inc, Minneapolis, MN) and nonadherent cells collected, re-
plated, and grown in α-MEM supplemented with 15% fetal
calf serum with MCSF (30 ng/mL) and soluble receptor acti-
vator of nuclear factor κB ligand (sRANKL, 60 ng/mL, Pepro-
tech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Osteoclastogenesis was assessed 4-5
days after euthanasia by counting the number of multinu-
cleated, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+,
Sigma Aldrich) cells in a deﬁned area by microscopy (be-
tween 18 and 45 mm2) to count a minimum of 200 cells. Os-
teoblastogenesis was assessed one month after irradiation by
quantifying the surface area covered by alizarin red-stained,
mineralized nodules.
2.4. Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP
8 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). To address aging, three
groups of sham controls were collected at diﬀerent time
points for analysis. Least squares linear regressions were per-
formed with time as regressor and the null hypothesis of the
slope being zero to assess changes over time. The coeﬃcient
of determination (R2) and the probability (P) of the slope
being zero are reported, with P = 0.05 the threshold for re-
jecting the null hypothesis.
For each time point after-irradiation, comparisons were
made between the sham-irradiated and irradiated mice. An-
alyses proceeded using one-factor ANOVA with the Tukey-
Kramer Honestly Signiﬁcant Diﬀerence post hoc test, and
P = 0.05 considered the threshold for signiﬁcance. All ﬁgures
report mean ± standard deviation (SD).

irradiated (0 cGy) on day 0 and tissues harvested 1 month (inset)

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Body Mass. Body weights were measured weekly during
the experiment. Sham-irradiated mice gained 10% body
mass from 10–14 wk of age (Figure 1. inset, R2 = 0.96, P <
0.05 for slope) and 30% body mass from 10–27 wk of age
(R2 = 0.99, P < 0.05 for slope). Compared to the age-
matched controls, irradiation at any dose did not aﬀect the
mass accrual (Figure 1). These data are consistent with pre-
vious studies that monitored radiation and aging eﬀects
[3, 4] and show that normal accrual of body mass, as a broad
measure of health over time at this age, was unimpeded by
exposure to gamma irradiation with these doses.
3.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Temporal Changes. Can-
cellous microarchitecture was evaluated using 3D microcom-
puted tomography. In sham-control mice, the cancellous
bone volume fraction remained constant (Figure 2(a)), bone
density increased, and most microarchitectural parameters
declined as the mice aged over the 4-month period of this
study. Trabecular number (−21%, R2 = 0.79, P < 0.05) and
connectivity density (−49%, R2 = 0.75, P < 0.05) declined
over 4 months (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)). Structure model in-
dex was unchanged within 4 months (Figure 2(f)). Each eig-
envalue of the anisotropy tensor increased (all P < 0.05)
within 4 months. The maximum eigenvalue increased 15%,
R2 = 0.30 (Figure 2(g)). The minimum eigenvalue increased
24%, R2 = 0.49 (data not shown). The remaining eigenvalue
increased 23%, R2 = 0.59 (data not shown). The degree of
anisotropy remained constant at 2.0 indicating a persistent
longitudinal orientation of the structure (Figure 2(h)). In
contrast to these indicators of increasing structural fragility
with aging, trabecular thickness (+22%, R2 = 0.35, P < 0.05)
as in [3], and tissue density (+9%, R2 = 0.59, P < 0.05) rose
over 4 months (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)).
We observed age-related changes in the cancellous mi-
croarchitecture of the tibia within the 4-month timeframe.
In our study, declines in trabecular number and connectivity
density ensued, while relative bone volume, rod-like mor-
phology and degree of anisotropy remained constant. Con-
currently, the cancellous tissue consolidated gains into thick-
er and denser, though fewer, trabecular struts. Trabeculae
were spaced farther apart with age (data not shown) and may
increase the propensity for strut buckling [23, 24]. These cha-
nges are consistent with normal aging of male C57BL/6 mice,
including declines of trabecular number and connectivity de-
nsity, which appeared to start sooner and fall more rapidly
with aging than the bone volume fraction [3, 4]. In sum,
these data suggest that age-related alterations of microarchi-
tecture within the mouse tibia may precede overt declines in
cancellous bone volume.
3.3. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Ionizing Radiation-Induced
Changes. Radiation doses of 1 cGy or 10 cGy had no dis-
cernible eﬀect on skeletal microarchitecture at either 1 or 4
months after-IR. In 100 cGy-IR mice, trabecular number and
connectivity density declined (−20% and −36%, resp.; P <
0.05) and trabecular spacing and the maximum eigenvalues
of the fabric tensor increased (+28% and +21%, resp.;
P < 0.05) at one month after-IR compared to age-matched
controls (Figure 2). There were no additional decrements
in microarchitecture compared to age-matched controls be-
tween 1 and 4 months after-IR (Figure 2). These results in-
dicate that 100 cGy irradiation caused rapid removal of
trabecular, which resembled the normal microarchitectural
changes expected to occur during 4 months of aging.
Irradiation with 100 cGy caused reductions in trabecular
number and connectivity density and increases in the major
axis of the anisotropy ellipsoid within 1 month—changes
that take 4 months to appear in sham-irradiated controls. In
previous studies that used older mice (16 weeks of age),
100 cGy caused bone loss in the tibia via reduced trabecular
thickness, but not trabecular number, with the onset of
osteopenia appearing 10 days after-irradiation [15]. The 16-
week-old mice are past peak cancellous bone volume in the
tibia, whereas the 10-week-old mice in this study have not
yet begun to decline. Microarchitectural changes following
irradiation observed in this study resembled the eﬀects of
a larger dose in older, male mice (16 weeks, 200 cGy) with-
in the lumbar spine (a denser, plate-like cancellous tissue)
[15] and in the tibia (unpublished results), where gamma
irradiation at 200 cGy caused vertebral and tibial bone loss
via trabecular number and connectivity density decrements
appearing within 3 days and persisting at least until 30 days
after-irradiation. This supports trabecular thinning preced-
ing strut removal during bone resorption. Furthermore, in
young female mice (9 weeks), osteopenia and trabecular
number and connectivity density decrements persist in the
tibia at 120 days after-irradiation [14]. Taken together, the
data indicate that bone resorption is a time-dependent proc-
ess contingent on initial bone volume and morphology (i.e.,

of TRAP-positive, multinuclear (≥3/cell) cells per area, remained constant in sham-control mice. Irradiation, at any dose (gray or black

tion of age.
In this study, microarchitectural diﬀerences between
irradiated and age-matched controls were not evident 4
months after exposure to 100 cGy radiation. This result con-
trasts to the persistence of osteopenia in the tibia after low
LET irradiation at higher doses (≥200 cGy X-ray or gamma
rays) or with particulate irradiation at doses of 100 cGy (pro-
ton) [25] and 200 cGy (56Fe) [14] which present at 120 days
after-irradiation in female mice (9 weeks). These ﬁndings
highlight the importance of age at the time of irradiation; ge-
nder also may inﬂuence skeletal radioresponses and further
study is needed in this area.
3.4. Bone Cell Diﬀerentiation Potential. To assess diﬀerentia-
tion of osteoblast lineage progenitors and precursors in the
mesenchymal stem cell lineage, adherent cells from bone
marrow were cultured in osteogenic medium up to one
month and then stained for mineralized nodules (Figure 3).
Irradiation did not aﬀect the area covered by mineralized
nodules (Figure 3(a)). These data suggest the osteoblast pro-
geny of irradiated cells are not aﬀected by a single, acute dose
of low LET, ionizing radiation.
Bone marrow cells were cultured after tissue harvest in
osteoclastogenic media and then osteoclast number counted.
In sham-irradiated controls, between 1 and 4 months after-
IR, the density of osteoclasts remained constant (Figure 3(b))
and indicates the number of precursors did not vary with
age. Furthermore, irradiation at any dose did not aﬀect the
diﬀerentiation potential of osteoclasts compared to controls.
Per animal, the ratio of nodule area fraction to osteoclast de-
nsity was calculated as a measure of the balance between
formation and resorption potential; this was unchanged in
controls between 1 and 4 months and unchanged after ir-
radiation at any dose (data not shown).

Thus, neither osteoblastogenesis nor osteoclastogenesis
by bone marrow cells was aﬀected by gamma irradiation,
consistent with our previous ﬁndings. These results suggest
the ability of marrow-derived progenitors to contribute to
skeletal remodeling is preserved, despite exposure to ionizing
radiation. Gamma rays or X-rays (200 cGy) can cause a ra-
pid (within 3 days) increase in the numbers of osteoclasts
lining the surfaces of trabeculae [15, 16], and a decrement in
actively mineralizing surfaces, an index of the activity of ma-
ture, active osteoblasts [12]. Taken together, our results sug-
gest that mature cells of the osteoblast and osteoclast lin-
eage, rather than progenitors, are responsible for the near-
term microarchitectural changes triggered by gamma radia-
tion.
A limitation of this study design is that bones were an-
alyzed at only two time points after exposure to radiation.
Additional timepoints would be useful to further charac-
terize the inﬂuence of radiation on age-related changes in
skeletal health.
4. Conclusions
A moderate dose (100 cGy) of gamma radiation accelerated
changes in the trabecular microarchitecture of postpubertal,
growing (10 wk old) male C57BL/6 mice at a rate comparable
to later skeletal aging in controls, whereas no eﬀects were
observed at even lower doses (1 or 10 cGy). Together with the
ﬁnding that BV/TV did not diﬀer over this time, these results
suggest age-related microarchitectural changes precede
bone loss. Bone marrow-derived osteoblast progenitors and
osteoclast precursors did not appear to be aﬀected by the
low-to-moderate doses of low LET gamma radiation used
here, suggesting stem and progenitor cells that reside in the
marrow will retain the ability to contribute to skeletal re-
modeling during subsequent aging following the low-to-
moderate doses employed. In contrast, exposure to high dos-
es of gamma radiation [6] or to high LET irradiation such
as 56Fe can inﬂict acute and persistent damage to osteo-
progenitors ([7], unpublished observations). In conclusion,
ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or
10 cGy) appeared to accelerate structural changes in the mur-
ine skeleton, expected also to occur during progressive, post-
pubertal aging in humans prior to the onset of type II os-
teoporosis.
