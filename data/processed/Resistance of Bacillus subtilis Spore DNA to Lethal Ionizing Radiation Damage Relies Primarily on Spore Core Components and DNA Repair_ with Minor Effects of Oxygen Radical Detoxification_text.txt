The roles of various core components, including //-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP), dipicolinic acid (DPA),
core water content, and DNA repair by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in
Bacillus subtilis spore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation including X rays, protons, and high-energy charged iron
ions have been studied. Spores deﬁcient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the oxidative stress response, or protec-
tion by major /-type SASP, DPA, and decreased core water content were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation
than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases
appears to be the most important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen radical detoxiﬁcation
via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX catalase activity plays only a very minor role. Synergistic radioprotec-
tive effects of /-type but not -type SASP were also identiﬁed, indicating that /-type SASP’s binding to spore DNA is im-
portant in preventing DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation.
S
pores of Bacillus subtilis have been used extensively as biolog-
ical indicators for industrial purposes such as sterilization or
decontamination. Spores have also been shown to be suitable do-
simeters for probing terrestrial and extraterrestrial ionizing radi-
ation in environmental and astrobiological studies (1–3; reviewed
in references 4, 5, 6, and 7). Ionizing radiation can damage cellular
components through direct transfer of radiation energy into
biomolecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins) and indirectly by gener-
ating reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the radiolysis of intra-
cellular H2O (8–11). The biological effects of ionizing radiation
are thought to arise from the formation of single- and double-
strand breaks (SSB and DSB) in cellular DNA and clustered DNA
damage, e.g., two or more closely spaced lesions, including abasic
sites, base lesions, SSB, and DSB. The biological effects of ionizing
radiation depend on the quality and the dose of radiation and on
the cell type (9–11). Linear energy transfer (LET) represents the
energy lost per unit distance as an ionizing particle travels through
a material, and it is used to quantify the effects of ionizing radia-
tion on biological specimens (5, 10–13). High-LET radiation
sources include protons, and high-energy-charged (HZE) parti-
cles give densely ionizing radiation, since they lose their energy in
a small distance and thus cause dense ionization along their tracks
and can give localized multiple DNA-damaging events. Low-LET
radiation sources, such as X rays, give sparsely ionizing radiation,
since they produce ionizations sparsely along their track and,
hence, almost homogeneously within a cell. The biological effects
of high-LET radiation are in general much higher than those of
low-LET radiation of the same energy (10, 12, 13). This is because
high-LET radiation deposits most of its energy within the volume
of one cell and the damage to DNA is therefore larger (9–11). This
is attributable to the formation of clusters of damage that result in
two or more DNA lesions along the tracks of high-LET radiation
sources, i.e., the physical path of the applied ionizing radiation
source in a cell.
Previous studies have indicated that in both pro- and eukary-
otic cells or under highly scavenging conditions mimicking those
for ROS scavenging in the cell, one-fourth of the lesions induced
in DNA by low-LET radiation can be ascribed to direct effects
increasing up to 80% for high-LET particles (9, 11, 12). Hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (HO·) are major oxidizing
species produced by the radiolysis of water, and superoxide ions
(O2·) are formed in the presence of dissolved oxygen (12, 13).
Lethal and mutagenic effects induced by ionizing radiation are
thought to be the result of DNA damage caused during the course
of irradiation (11, 14–16). Spore DNA resides in the innermost
spore compartment, the core, and dormant spores of B. subtilis
possess a complex arsenal of protective attributes in the core, in
particular a low core water content as well as abundant novel core
constituents such as (i) the calcium chelate of dipicolinic acid
(Ca-DPA), which comprises 25% of core dry weight, and (ii)
small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP) of the / type, which
bind spore DNA and protect it from many types of damage, in-
cluding UV photoproducts, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, and
oxidative lesions (17, 18, 47; reviewed in references 4, 6, and 19).
Spore DNA is saturated with a group of unique proteins called
/-type SASP, which are encoded by multiple genes and synthe-
sized only during sporulation in the developing spore. These /-

type SASP are nonspeciﬁc DNA-binding proteins that bind to
random-sequence double-strand DNA and comprise approxi-
mately 5% of total spore protein (reviewed in references 6 and 18).
The high levels of /-type SASP in spores are sufﬁcient to satu-
rate the spore DNA, and the DNA within this nucleoprotein com-
plex is protected from a variety of environmental insults (4, 7).
Germinating spores also can detoxify ROS using enzymes such
as catalase (KatX) and superoxide dismutase (SodA), although
these enzymes play no role in dormant spore resistance to oxidiz-
ing agents, most likely because enzymes in the spore core are in-
active due to the core’s low water content (20–23). Mechanisms to
prevent damage caused by ROS, in particular damage to DNA,
include protective DNA-binding proteins as well as enzymes such
as alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, catalases, and superoxide dis-
mutases, which can destroy the oxidizing agents alkyl hydroper-
oxides, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide, respectively. A study
of the role of oxidative stress responsive proteins such as the DNA-
binding protein MrgA, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, catalases,
and superoxide dismutases in the resistance of B. subtilis spores to
oxidative stress caused by paraquat and hydrogen peroxide expo-
sure showed that inactivation of genes coding for the protective
enzymes or MrgA had no effect on the spores’ heat or hydrogen
peroxide resistance (21). Spore DNA damage can also be repaired
during germination via a number of different pathways such as
direct reversal, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ, encoded by
YkoV and YkoU), base and nucleotide excision repair (BER and
NER, respectively), mismatch repair, recombination-mediated
repair, and translesion synthesis (24–28; reviewed in references 6
and 29). Two AP endonucleases, ExoA and Nfo, have also been
implicated in the repair of AP sites caused by oxidizing agents in
germinating B. subtilis spores (24). However, there has been no
systematic study of the relationship between the spore core pro-
tective features (i.e., //-type SASP, DPA, and core hydration),
the oxidative stress response (by MrgA), ROS detoxiﬁcation (via
SodA or KatX), and DNA repair (by NHEJ or BER) in spores’
ionizing radiation resistance, and this is the subject of the present
work.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, growth, sporulation, and spore puriﬁcation. The B.
subtilis strains used in this work are listed in Table 1, and all are isogenic
with the wild-type strain PS832. Spores were obtained by cultivation un-
der vigorous aeration at 37°C for 7 days in double-strength liquid Schaef-
fer sporulation medium (30), and spores were puriﬁed and stored as de-
scribed previously (31–33). When appropriate, chloramphenicol (5 g/
ml), neomycin (10 g/ml), spectinomycin (100 g/ml), erythromycin (1
g/ml), or tetracycline (10 g/ml) was added to the medium. Spore prep-
arations consisted of single spores with no detectable clumps and were
free (99%) of growing cells, germinated spores, and cell debris, as seen
in the phase-contrast microscope (32–34).
Measurement of spore resistance to ionizing radiation. Preparation
of spore samples for radiation exposure has been described in detail pre-
viously (33, 34). In brief, suspensions of spores of the different B. subtilis
strains (Table 1) were prepared in sterile distilled water to a ﬁnal concen-
tration of 1 	 108 spores per ml. Triplicate samples of spores in water (100
l) were individually exposed to three different types of ionizing radia-
tion: X rays (200 keV/15 mA), protons (with energy of 218 MeV, LET of
0.4 keV/m, and a range of 301 mm in water), and high-energy-charged
iron ions (Fe; with energy of 500 MeV/nucleon, LET of 200 keV/m, and
a range of 99 mm in water). X ray, proton, and Fe irradiations were con-
ducted at the German Aerospace Center, Institute of Aerospace Medicine
(DLR-ME), in Cologne, Germany, at the University of Florida Proton
Therapy Institute (UF-PTI), Jacksonville, Florida, USA, and at the heavy
ion medical accelerator (HIMAC) facility at the National Institute for
Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Chiba, Japan, respectively. Details on the
irradiation geometry of the NIRS-HIMAC, DLR-ME, and UF-PTI facili-
ties, beam monitoring, dosimetry, and dose calculations have been de-
scribed (34–37).
Numerical and statistical analysis. Spore survival was determined
from appropriate dilutions in distilled water as colony-forming ability
after incubation overnight at 37°C on nutrient broth (NB) agar plates
(Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) (33, 34, 36). The surviving fraction of B. subtilis
spores was determined from the ratio N/N0, where N is the number of
CFU of the irradiated sample and N0 that of the nonirradiated controls.
Spore inactivation curves were obtained as described previously (34).
Data are reported as D10-values, the dose of ionizing radiation killing 90%
of the initial spore population (34). All data are expressed as averages 
standard deviations (n  3). The signiﬁcance of the differences in the
survival rates and relative sensitivities were determined by analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA), using SigmaPlot software Version 12.0 (Systat Software
GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Values were evaluated in multigroup pair-
wise combinations, and differences with P values of 0.05 were consid-
ered statistically signiﬁcant (33, 34, 36).
RESULTS
The importance of the two types of SASP, the DNA-binding /
type and non-DNA-binding  type, alone and in combination
with various other protective spore core components, including
core water content and DPA, has been assessed to establish their
roles as radioprotectants. B. subtilis spores have several additional
potential mechanisms for minimizing damage to spore DNA in-
cluding BER via AP endonucleases (by ExoA and Nfo), DNA dou-
ble-strand break repair (via NHEJ by YkoU and V), and radical
detoxiﬁcation (superoxide dismutase SodA and major spore cat-
alase KatX), as well as via the oxidative stress response (DNA-

binding protein MrgA); spores of strains lacking these various
gene products have been also included in this study. Wild-type
and mutant spores (Table 1) were subjected to three different
types of ionizing radiation, X rays, protons, and high-energy Fe
ions.
Role of spore core components in ionizing radiation resis-
tance. Spore structures (e.g., the spore coat and cortex) and com-
ponents in the spore core (e.g., Ca-DPA, /-type SASP) have
previously been demonstrated to protect spores from inactivation
after exposure to various sporicidal treatments such as exposure to
UV radiation, hydrogen peroxide, or heat (reviewed in references
4, 6, and 7). Spores lacking various spore core components were
irradiated with X rays (Fig. 1A), protons (Fig. 1B), or Fe ions (Fig.
1C). In order, from most to least sensitive, were spores of mutants
in sspA (encoding one of two major /-type SASP [38])  sspB
(encoding the less abundant major /-type SASP [38])  dacB,
previously shown to exhibit a 1.6-fold-increased core water con-
tent (52 to 65%) compared to that of wild-type spores (34 to 41%)
(22, 23)  sleB plus spoVF (which allow isolation of stable spores
that lack Ca-DPA [39])  sspE (encoding the only -type SASP;
termed  spores), which is equivalent to the wild type (Fig. 1).
Radiation resistance of spores carrying mutations in sspE,
dacB, or both sleB and spoVF was tested either in a wild-type back-
ground or in an sspA sspB background lacking both major /-
type SASP (termed  spores) (Fig. 2). The combined effects
on spore sensitivity, from most sensitive to least, were as follows:
 dacB   sleB spoVF    wild-type   (Fig.
2). The results show that spore core dehydration and DPA, but not
-type SASP, function in addition to /-type SASP as radiopro-
tectants in the spore core.

detoxiﬁcation, the oxidative stress response DNA-binding protein
MrgA, or DNA repair were exposed to X rays, protons, and Fe
ions, and their sensitivities were compared (Fig. 3). Spores deﬁ-
cient in radical detoxiﬁcation (sodA or katX spores) were no more
sensitive than wild-type spores to any type of ionizing radiation
tested (Fig. 3), as expected given the minimal activity of enzymes
in the spore core. Spores lacking a major oxidative-stress-protec-
tive protein (mrgA spores) were signiﬁcantly more sensitive than
wild-type spores to X rays and Fe ions, but not to protons, which
could be due to the different spectra of lesions induced by the
three types of radiation (9, 11, 15) (Fig. 3). Spores lacking BER
(exoA nfo spores) and double-strand break repair (ykoVU spores)
were both signiﬁcantly more sensitive to all types of radiation than
wild-type spores (Fig. 3). Comparison of the spore radiation re-
sistance in wild-type and  backgrounds showed that in re-
sponse to X rays only the ykoVU spores showed an additive effect
with the loss of /-type SASP (Fig. 4A). In response to proton
exposure, the effects of the katX, mrgA, exoA nfo, and ykoVU mu-
tations (but not sodA) were all potentiated in the  back-
ground (Fig. 4B). In response to Fe ions, only the exoA nfo (BER-
deﬁcient)

demonstrated a signiﬁcantly enhanced sensitivity in the 
background (Fig. 4C).
DISCUSSION
In regard to the characteristic resistance to ionizing radiation,
spores of the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis have often been
used to evaluate sterilization efforts in areas of food preservation,
medical sterilization, and decontamination of potential biohaz-
ardous materials (3, 4, 6). Ionizing radiation is known to cause
damage to numerous targets within the cell, including DNA, due
both to (i) direct interaction of the radiation with the target mol-
ecule and to (ii) indirect effects due to the production of reactive
species such as oxygen radicals (9, 10, 12, 13, 15). Ionizing radia-

tion induces a large variety of damages to DNA bases and through
interaction with the sugar moiety can cause formation of DNA
strand breaks, either SSB or DSB. DNA strand breaks were re-
ported to be the major lesions in the genome of spores exposed to
ionizing radiation (reviewed in references 4 and 7), caused either
directly by the highly energetic photons or accelerated particles or
indirectly via interaction of radiation-induced free radicals, e.g.,
ROS, with the DNA (9, 13, 15, 16). The results of several radiobi-
ological studies at accelerators and in space experiments lead to
the assumption that at least two qualitatively different lesions are
formed depending on the type and energy of the applied ionizing
radiation. The spore’s structure and chemical composition play
major roles in spore resistance (6, 7, 18). The spore’s general struc-
ture is very different from that of a growing cell, with a number of
features and constituents unique to spores (4). Several of these
features have been shown to be involved in spore resistance to
some chemicals and physical treatments, but little is known of
their role in spore resistance to ionizing radiation. Spore DNA is
saturated with a group of SASP that bind to DNA largely on the
outside of the DNA helix and straighten and stiffen the DNA while
changing the DNA to an A-like helix (reviewed in reference 6 and
references therein). As a consequence, DNA properties in spores
are dramatically different from those in vegetative cells, e.g., spore
DNA complexed with SASP is much more resistant to chemical
attack, thermal degradation, and UV radiation (6, 7, 17, 22, 40),
strongly suggesting that SASP may also be important for spore
resistance to ionizing radiation, as indicated in earlier studies test-
ing mutants lacking a single SASP (17, 33).
The current work has shown that protective components in the
spore core are important determinants of spore resistance to X
ray, proton, and heavy Fe ion bombardment with the order of
importance being as follows: /-type SASP  core dehydra-
tion  DPA. In contrast, the single major -type SASP does not
bind to DNA and plays no protective role in spore ionizing radi-
ation resistance, as has also been found when spore resistance to
many other agents has been tested (23, 37; reviewed in reference 6)
(Fig. 1 and 2). In the dormant state, spores remain metabolically
inactive, and thus substantial DNA, protein, tRNA, and ribosome
damage may accumulate, and the spores are incapable of repairing
and/or degrading such damaged DNA and proteins (6, 7, 18).
Consequently, damage to DNA, proteins, or other essential com-
ponents of bacterial spores poses a unique problem, since such
repair of such damage does not occur until the processes of ger-
mination and outgrowth, when spores reactivate and prepare to
return to vegetative growth (6, 7, 28). Repair of DSB and base
modiﬁcation/loss via NHEJ and BER appear to be important
mechanisms for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, and the
MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response (with effects in wild-
type spores for X-ray stress and in  spores for proton radia-
tion resistance) plays a lesser role. In contrast, ROS detoxiﬁcation
by catalase or superoxide dismutase appears to play a very minor
role, if any, in spore resistance to ionizing radiation, as is also the
case in spore resistance to oxidizing agents such as hydrogen per-
oxide and superoxide (20, 21) (Fig. 3 and 4). Clearly the data
indicate that spore DNA is a major target of lethal ionizing radia-
tion damage, based on the observation that the major factors con-
tributing signiﬁcantly to spore survival (Fig. 3 and 4) in response
to different types of ionizing radiation are known to be important
in either DNA protection in spores or DNA repair in spore germi-
nation and outgrowth. The ﬁndings in this communication thus
complement the results from microarray experiments demon-
strating upregulation of stress-related regulons responding to
DNA damage (SOS response) and oxidative stress (PerR regulon)
during germination of spores exposed to space conditions, includ-
ing the effects of galactic cosmic radiation (41).
Spores appear to have two possible ways to minimize deleteri-
ous effects of ionizing radiation: (i) by protecting dormant spore
DNA from damage in the ﬁrst place (Fig. 1 and 2) and (ii) by
ensuring detoxiﬁcation and repair of direct and indirect damage
during spore germination (Fig. 3 and 4). Because ionizing radia-
tion causes such a wide spectrum of direct and indirect DNA dam-
age, it will be interesting to determine the contributions of addi-
tional error-free and error-prone DNA repair pathways (e.g.,
mismatch repair, translesion synthesis, and homologous recom-
bination [29, 42–44]), to gain further detailed insights into spore
resistance to ionizing radiation.
