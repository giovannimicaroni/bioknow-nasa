Introduction
Plants live in a complex and dynamic environment and
thus have evolved systems that monitor multiple stimuli
and then integrate this information into an appropriate
plant-wide response. To accomplish this feat, plants re-
quire signaling systems driven by local stimulus perception
and response combined with a communication network
to broadcast this information throughout the plant body.
In this way, responses to even highly localized stimuli,
such as an insect chewing on one leaf, can play out in dis-
tant tissues. There are numerous chemical signaling mole-
cules used to perform this systemic signaling ranging from
mobile hormones and peptides to metabolites and RNAs.
Additionally, evidence for a parallel informational system
built around changes in ion fluxes, reactive oxygen species
(ROS), and electrical signaling has begun to emerge. In this
update, we will briefly introduce some recent ideas about
the multiple, systemic communication pathways operating
over different scales and timeframes within the plant.
In particular, for the rapid ionic/ROS/electrical systemic
signaling system, key progress has now been made in
defining the molecular identities of some of the channels,
pumps,
and
enzymes
involved
in
driving
signal
propagation.
ADVANCES

peptide signaling in plants and identiﬁcation of
the protein kinases that act as their receptors
adds important new context for understanding
plant systemic signaling.

Cell-to-cell and long-range chemical signaling in
plants: slow and steady
Plants have long been known to integrate their physiology
and development through mobile chemical signals. The
hormone auxin is a classic example, where the coordinated
activity of membrane transporters such as the AUX/LAX,
PIN, and ABCBs move auxin in a polar fashion from cell to
adjacent cell (Grones and Friml, 2015). The auxin flux then
provides both temporal and spatial information to the plant,
e.g. driving local patterning within the developing vegetative
meristem (Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2020). In addition to
hormones, various other regulators are also now known to
similarly integrate development and physiology by moving
from cell to adjacent cell. For example, in the root, the
SHORTROOT protein must move from where it is made in
the root xylem, procambium, and xylem-adjacent pericycle
to other nearby cells, such as the phloem poles and
quiescent center, where it then acts to, e.g. control phloem
development (Kim et al., 2020).
In addition to such systems providing relatively “local”
communication between nearby cells and tissues, there are
also a host of mobile signaling molecules that integrate ac-
tivities over much larger distances within the plant, such as
between organs. The polar transport of auxin once again
provides an example of one kind of machinery for this long-
range exchange of information. Thus, the movement of
auxin across many cells within the shoot system allows the
apical meristem to integrate its activities with axillary meris-
tems through the process of apical dominance (Barbier
et al., 2019), or enables the shoot to communicate with
roots about its CO2 environment (Zhou et al., 2019). In
other cases, such long-distance communication systems are
thought to use the mass flow within the vascular system to
support their more rapid transport throughout the plant.
Thus, movement of RNA, proteins, peptides, hormones,
metabolites, and even nutrients within the xylem or phloem
allows one part of the plant to communicate and coordi-
nate its activities with distant organs (reviewed in Ham and
Lucas, 2017; Winter and Kragler, 2018). For example, Ca2 +
moving up in the transpiration stream may couple stomatal
responses in the leaf to Ca2 + supply from the roots (Han
et al., 2003). This mobile Ca2 + signal acts through a plastid-
based receptor system in the guard cells that itself may fur-
ther integrate these responses with, e.g. photoacclimation
(Cutolo et al., 2019).
The potential scope of the vasculature as an information
highway for chemical messengers is exemplified by studies
on the RNAs found to be mobile in the phloem. In addition
to mRNAs, micro RNAs, silencing-induced RNAs, transfer
RNAs, and even ribosomal RNAs are also found moving in
phloem sap (Kehr and Kragler, 2018), with estimates of
approximately 20% of the protein-coding RNAs found to
move systemically. The presence of many of these RNAs
in the translocation stream may reflect non-specific leakage
of companion cell contents into sieve tubes (Calderwood
et al., 2016) or remnants from sieve tube differentiation
(Knoblauch et al., 2018). Even so, motifs such as transfer
RNA-like sequences can tag RNAs for selective transport in
the translocation stream (Zhang et al., 2016), and there does
appear to be selectivity in the macromolecules found to be
moving within the phloem (Garg and Ku¨hn, 2020).
Of note in systemic signals moving in the xylem and
phloem is the rising profile of mobile peptides as a theme in
how
plants
integrate
their
activities
between
organs.
Systemin was discovered as the first plant (wound) signaling
peptide several decades ago (Pearce et al., 1991), and now
small secreted peptides are known to underlie a host of de-
velopmental and physiological responses ranging from guard
cell differentiation and meristem function to gravitropism
(reviewed in Matsubayashi, 2014; Blackburn et al., 2020).
This recent characterization of the extent of such mobile
peptide signaling by the plant, along with defining the array
of plasma membrane receptor-like kinases that underlie
many of their perception machineries (reviewed in Chen
et al., 2020), represents an important and exciting recent
step forward in our understanding of plant systemic signals.
For example, an array of peptides released to the vascular
system in the root are now known to carry information
such
as
drought
(CLAVATA3/ESR-related
25
peptide;
Takahashi et al., 2018) or nitrate status (C-terminally
encoded peptides; CEPs; Tabata et al., 2014) to the aerial
parts of the plant. In the case of nitrogen signaling, CEP
DOWNSTREAM peptides (Ohkubo et al., 2017) appear to
complete the circuit, carrying information from the shoot to
the roots through the phloem. Although CEP and CEP
DOWNSTREAM are integral to coordinating plant-wide ni-
trate responses, plants likely use multiple parallel signals in
these long-range communication systems. For example, the
plant hormone cytokinin is known to operate alongside
these peptide signals in the systemic nitrogen status signal-
ing network (Ruffel et al., 2016; Poitout et al., 2018).
Undoubtedly, such chemical exchanges of information be-
tween adjacent cells and through the vascular highways ex-
plain many key components of the systemic signaling
occurring within the plant. However, the speed seen in the
plant’s internal communications suggests additional signal-
ing networks must be operating. Auxin moves through the
plant at rates of only micrometers per second (Kramer
et al., 2011) and small molecules passing through plasmo-
desmata likely travel at a similar speed (e.g. Rutschow et al.,
2011). Although mass transport in the xylem or phloem is
much faster, typically in the 200–400 mm/s range (e.g. Peuke
et al., 2001; Savage et al., 2013; Knoblauch et al., 2016), sys-
temic signals to, e.g. wounding or high light stress can move
at rates in excess of 1,000 mm/s (Table 1 and see below).
Systems using self-reinforcing waves of ROS, Ca2 +, electrical,
and potentially even hydraulic signals are thought to sup-
port this much more rapid propagation of systemic
information.
Rapid systemic signaling: the need for speed
The rapid systemic signaling and response in leaf move-
ments of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and sensi-
tive plant (Mimosa pudica) provide a dramatic illustration of

how fast plant systemic signals can travel. The Venus flytrap
is a carnivorous plant that traps insects between two modi-
fied leaves that are joined at the base by a hinge that allows
them to snap together to form a cage. The adaxial surface
of each leaf possesses exquisitely sensitive sensory hairs that,
when mechanically stimulated, trigger the trap to close
(Scherzer et al., 2019). The hairs activate distant motor cells
in the hinge region that levers the two halves of the trap to-
gether in approximately 100 ms (Forterre et al., 2005). This
speed is required by the plant in order to catch fast moving
insects, but how is it achieved? A combination of the elastic
structure of the lobes of the trap and rapid turgor-driven
changes in motor cell volume drive the physical movements
of the trap lobes (Forterre et al., 2005), but what mediates
the rapid communication from the sensory hair to the mo-
tor cells? The signal is electrical, i.e. mechanical stimulation
of the sensory hair generates a transient depolarization of
the membrane potential (an action potential, AP) in the
cells at its base that propagates throughout the leaf at the
rate of 54–115 mm/s. It is the arrival of this AP at the lobe
that triggers the leaf closure (Sibaoka, 1966).
Similarly, the sensitive plant M. pudica folds its leaflets
and moves its petioles quickly (1 s) in response to a vari-
ety of mechanical and other physical stimuli (Hagihara and
Toyota, 2020). Again, the movements are driven by a
turgor-powered motor, in this case an organ called the pul-
vinus, and the rapid signaling appears linked to propagating
electrical signals. Non-damaging stimuli (e.g. cold shock or
touch) generate an AP that transmits through the plant and
then induces the leaflets to move upon its arrival at the ter-
tiary pulvinus (Figure 1, A; Sibaoka, 1966). The AP propa-
gates at 3–7 mm/s in the rachilla (the shaft to which the
leaflets are attached) and 6–44 mm/s in the petiole at the
base of the whole compound leaf structure (Sibaoka, 1966).
These electrical signals are likely moving through the sieve
tubes and the parenchyma cells in the protoxylem and
phloem (Sibaoka, 1962; Samejima and Sibaoka, 1983; Fromm
and Eschrich, 1988). By contrast, damaging stimuli (e.g. cut-
ting or burning leaflets) generates both the AP and an addi-
tional electrical signal called a variation potential (VP, also
known as a slow wave potential; Figure 1, B; Houwink,
1935). The VP appears to be related to the flow of
stimulating chemicals in the xylem vessels and propagates at
the rate of 1–4 mm/s in the petiole (Houwink, 1935), i.e.
more slowly than that of the AP. Moreover, the existence of
a non-electrical (possibly hydraulic), even faster signal is also
implied (Houwink, 1935; Malone, 1994). Thus, when the en-
tire organ is strongly damaged (e.g. pruning off of a collec-
tion of leaflets or pinna), the primary pulvinus and petiole
move earlier than the arrival of either the APs or VPs
(Houwink, 1935). In addition, when leaflets are extensively
damaged by burning, the thickness of distant leaves is al-
most immediately changed by a signal moving in excess of
15 mm/s (Figure 1, B; Malone, 1994), possibly linked to
wound-related pressure changes propagating through the
vasculature. Thus, physical damage that breaks the integrity
of the xylem is expected to release the tension in these ves-
sels and due to the relatively incompressible nature of water,
this pressure change will be almost instantly transmitted
through the vasculature. Indeed, such a hydraulic wave has
been proposed to mediate wounding events in a range of
plants, where it is thought to propagate through the xylem
and potentially phloem vessels. The pressure wave may act
to either disperse a stimulating chemical from the wounded
tissues or directly trigger mechanically responsive signaling
systems within the systemic tissues (e.g. Boari and Malone,
1993; Farmer et al., 2014; Evans and Morris, 2017). However,
such hydraulic effects are thought likely to move at speeds
up to 100,000-fold faster than the observed propagation of
wound-induced electrical and Ca2 + signals, making it com-
plex to relate their kinetics to these other systemic signals
(Evans and Morris, 2017). The action of hydraulic signals
transmitted through the plant vasculature represents a rapid
signaling mechanism seemingly well-tailored to plant anat-
omy. However, definitively showing such a mechanism in ac-
tion has been, and remains, a significant challenge in
experimental design. For excellent discussions of this area,
see Evans and Morris (2017) and Farmer et al. (2020).
Channels, pumps, and systemic signals
Just as for the potential hydraulic signal, the electrical signals
that appear central to the rapid systemic signaling in
Dionaea and Mimosa are thought to play similar roles in
fast, long-distance communication within many plants. For

example, an insect chewing on a leaf causes both APs and
VPs propagating from the damaged leaf toward distal sites
in many species (e.g. Mousavi et al., 2013; Salvador-Recatala`
et al., 2014). Importantly, being able to study these phenom-
ena in Arabidopsis has allowed the field to begin to define
the machineries driving these changes with molecular
precision.
Plants maintain an approximately –200 mV potential
across their plasma membranes, largely through the action
of ion channels, pumps, and transporters (Tester, 1990).
Propagating changes in this potential, as seen in Mimosa
and Dionaea, may act as signals to rapidly carry information
throughout many plants. APs are transient depolarization
and repolarization events with set amplitude, velocity, and
durations that last on the scale of seconds (Figure 2, A; e.g.
Favre et al., 2001; Cuin et al., 2018). By contrast, VPs are
characterized by variable initial amplitude and a much
slower repolarization (sometimes with superimposed spikes
similar to APs) that last for minutes (Figure 2, B). VPs also
differ from APs in that the shape of their change in poten-
tial over time, and their velocity are dependent on the in-
tensity of the triggering stimulus and decrease with distance
from the location of their initiation (Fromm and Lautner,
2007; Sukhov et al., 2013; Vodeneev et al., 2016). Thus, VPs
have the potential to encode information about the
strength and distance of the stimulus that triggered them,
whereas APs have the characteristics of an all-or-nothing,
rapid, long-range signal. Both VPs and APs reflect the fluxes
of ions that cause both depolarization and successive repo-
larization of the plasma membrane. Therefore, such electrical
signaling is intimately related to the regulation of membrane
ion channels, pumps, and other transporters. The recent elu-
cidation of the molecular identities of some of these compo-
nents has proven a key step forward in our understanding
how systemic signals may be propagating.
The glutamate receptor-like channels
Whereas it has long been known that fluxes of Ca2 +, K +,
Cl–, and H + are all contributing to the production of APs
and VPs (Figure 2, C and D; Vodeneev et al., 2016), the spe-
cific channels and pumps involved have only just begun to
be defined. We currently have perhaps the most detailed
model for channel involvement in the systemic wound re-
sponse in Arabidopsis, where cation channels of the
GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) family have been
confirmed to be integral to generating VPs. The GLRs are
ligand- (amino acid-) gated, non-selective (Na + and Ca2 +
permeable; e.g. Wudick et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020) cation
channels, with 20 isoforms in Arabidopsis. Mutants in GLRs
3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.6 disrupt the duration of the wound-
related VP in Arabidopsis (Mousavi et al., 2013). The associ-
ated systemic cytosolic Ca2 + signal (Nguyen et al., 2018;
Toyota et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020), spread by a systemic
increase in ROS (Lew et al., 2020; and see below) and electri-
cal signaling in the phloem (Salvador-Recatala` et al., 2014),
are also disrupted by mutations in GLR3.3 and GLR3.6
(Figure 3, A), suggesting a role for GLRs in the cation influx
during the depolarization phase of the wound-triggered VP.
Wound-induced

increases are still generated in the directly damaged leaves
in these mutants; however, they fail to propagate through-
out the plant (Salvador-Recatala` et al., 2014; Hedrich et al.,
Figure 1 Rapid signaling and response in Mimosa. A, Non-wounding stimulus (ice, 0 s) causes rapid movement of leaﬂets driven by turgor
changes in the pulvini at their bases. Cold shock generates only an AP (orange arrows) that cannot propagate past the secondary pulvinus at the
base of a pinna (20 s), leading to a local response of the stimulated pinna only. B, Damage (ﬂame, 0 s) triggers rapid closing of a leaf. Such damage
causes a putative hydraulic wave (blue arrows), a rapidly propagating AP (orange arrows), and a slower moving VP (red arrows). Once these sig-
nals arrive at the pulvinus, movements of ions and water cause changes in pulvinar cell volume that in turn causes the leaf to move.

2016; Toyota et al., 2018), implying their role in events spe-
cifically related to VP propagation. In contrast, GLR3.5 is
thought to act to limit the extent of electrical signaling,
with mutants in this channel showing much more extensive
spread of damage-induced APs (Salvador-Recatala`, 2016).
Similarly, GLR3.1 may play a role in determining the extent
of the spread of systemic Ca2 + increases across distal leaves
(Nguyen et al., 2018). This role for GLRs in systemic signaling
does not appear limited to Arabidopsis. For example, a
CRISPR/Cas9-induced
mutation
that
prematurely
stops
translation of the AtGLR 3.6 ortholog in tomato (Solanum-
lycopersicum; SlGLR3.5) blocks wound-induced systemic VPs
and increases in ROS (Wang et al., 2019). Mutations in eight
other Arabidopsis GLRs tested by Mousavi et al. (2013) did
not have a significant effect on the dynamics of wound-
triggered VPs, suggesting specificity within the GLRs for ac-
tivities in the systemic electrical signaling system. However,
as a note of caution, it takes a double mutant in both
GLR3.3 and 3.6 to effectively ablate the wound-induced
Ca2 + wave and VP. Therefore, we must await a systematic
analysis of the role(s) of the GLRs alone, and in combina-
tion, to robustly define how much of the temporal and spa-
tial dynamics of systemic signaling can be explained by the
actions of this channel family.
GLRs 3.1, 3.3, and 3.6 have been reported in a range of
subcellular sites in plants, including the ER, tonoplast, and
plasma membrane (e.g. Singh et al., 2016; Nguyen et al.,
2018; Wudick et al., 2018), suggesting a potentially complex
interaction of organellar signaling machineries and the
plasma membrane ion fluxes behind VPs. These channels
are also expressed in different cell types in aerial tissues,
with e.g. GLR3.6 (and GLR3.1) being predominantly pro-
duced in xylem contact cells (xylem parenchyma cells adja-
cent to the conducting vessels) and GLR3.3 in the phloem
sieve tubes (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018). One ex-
planation for the observations that mutating both GLR3.3
and 3.6 is required to fully ablate systemic wound signals,
even though they are in different cell types, is the presence
Figure 2 Plant electrical/ionic systemic signaling. A, Change in electrical potential of an AP is characterized by a short depolarization followed by
a repolarization. B, Change in electrical potential of a VP is typiﬁed by a sharp depolarization and slow repolarization often with AP-like spikes
superimposed. The magnitude of the VP diminishes with distance from the originating stimulus. C, Model for possible series of events related to
wound-induced VP and Ca2 + wave. Dashed lines represent speculative regulatory activities. Cation channel activation (through ROS and/or ligand
binding) triggers Ca2 + inﬂux with contributions from CNGCs and potentially from plasma membrane-localized GLRs. The molecular identity of
the proposed ROS-activated Ca2 +-permeable plasma membrane channel in this system remains unknown. GLRs on internal membranes, along
with TPC1 on the tonoplast, may be operating in an ampliﬁcation system that reinforces the cytosolic Ca2 + change. When coupled with Cl– efﬂux
and inactivation of H +-ATPases, these events lead to depolarization of the plasma membrane. Ca2 +-dependent processes would be likely candi-
dates to coordinate these activities but precise molecular machineries await to be deﬁned. The accompanying rise in apoplastic pH from inhibi-
tion of the H +-ATPase further activates putative GLR Ca2 + conductances at the plasma membrane. The resultant cytoplasmic Ca2 + elevation
should then lead to activation of RBOHs and further apoplastic ROS production, and thus to a feed-forward loop supporting cell-to-cell propaga-
tion of the signal. D, Slow inﬂux of ROS into the cytosol via aquaporins could then inactivate TPC1, inhibiting the cytosolic Ca2 + ampliﬁer.
Repolarization would then be driven by H +-ATPase reactivation and K + release, restoring the membrane potential. A reduction in apoplastic pH
would inhibit GLR activity, further contributing to the resetting of the system.

Johns et al.

of a putative electro-osmotic signal that couples hydraulic
changes in the xylem and phloem during propagation of the
systemic wound signal (Farmer et al., 2020). Alternatively,
two independent systemic wound signaling pathways may
be operating in the vascular tissues: one in the xylem medi-
ated by GLR3.6 and one in the phloem using GLR3.3, where
each is sufficient to trigger a systemic wound response on
its own.
Other candidate channels in systemic signaling
networks
In addition to the GLRs, there are a host of other promising
candidates for systemic signaling-related channel activities
such as the Ca2 + permeable CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED
CHANNELs (CNGCs). CNGCs are a family of 20 cation chan-
nels reported to be found on both the plasma and internal
membranes. CNGCs have already been linked to responses
to stimuli that are known to trigger systemic signaling, such
as heat stress, wounding, or pathogen attack (e.g. Ali et al.,
2007; Meena et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019; Jogawat et al.,
2020). Indeed, CNGC19 has been shown to be a Ca2 +-per-
meable, plasma membrane- (Meena et al., 2019) and possi-
bly vacuolar-localized (Yuen and Christopher, 2013) channel
required for propagation of the systemic wound-induced
Ca2 + signal across the wounded leaf (Meena et al., 2019).
Thus, mutants in this gene show a failure to efficiently trans-
mit the wound-triggered Ca2 + wave within the damaged
leaf, and are also compromised in plant-wide defenses
against insect herbivory (Meena et al., 2019). Whether the
CNGC family as a whole plays as integral a role in these sys-
temic events as the GLRs appear to do remains to be
investigated.
K + channels are also thought to be integral elements of
electrical signal propagation (Figure 2, C and D), but again,
we have only just scratched the surface as far as analyses of
their
potential
role(s)
in
systemic
signal
propagation.
Mutants

GUARD
CELL
OUTWARD RECTIFYING K + channel (GORK) do have al-
tered kinetics of membrane depolarization and repolariza-
tion and generate altered dynamics of APs (Cuin et al.,
2018). By comparison, although mutants in the ubiquitously
expressed ARABIDOPSIS K + TRANSPORTER 2 (AKT2) do
not alter AP characteristics, they do reduce the proportion
of plants that produce stimulus-evoked APs (Cuin et al.,
2018). By contrast, the STELAR OUTWARD RECTIFYING K +
channel (SKOR), a close relative of GORK that is expressed
in the vasculature (Garcia-Mata et al., 2010), does not ap-
pear to play a role in wound-related VPs (Mousavi et al.,
2013).
Similar to this limited knowledge of systemic signaling-
related cation channels, the channels and transporters mov-
ing anions such as Cl– across the plasma membrane during
systemic electrical signal propagation (Figure 2, C and D)
also remain to be fully explored. Thus, although the anion
channels CLC-b (tonoplast; von der Fecht-Bartenbach et al.,
2010) and CLC-e (thylakoid; Herdean et al., 2016) do not ap-
pear to be involved in wound-induced systemic VPs
(Mousavi et al., 2013), the roles of other plant anion chan-
nels in systemic signaling are yet to be characterized.
H + pumps
H +-ATPases have long been known to be inactivated during
the depolarization phase and then reactivated during the
Figure 3 Model for systemic wound signaling in Arabidopsis. A, Local
wounding rapidly triggers production of JA in the directly damaged
tissues and also in distant tissues. JA signaling then triggers both local
and systemic anti-herbivory defenses. Damage at the wound site (pu-
tatively signaled by release of glutamate from damaged cells; Toyota
et al., 2018) triggers VP propagation and a wave of increased ROS and
Ca2 + that moves through the vasculature to distal leaves where it
spreads through plasmodesmatal connections to trigger systemic
defenses (Toyota et al., 2018). Transmission is dependent on the ac-
tion of the GLR ion channels and the plasma membrane H + pump
AHA1. B and C, In the systemic leaves, the Ca2 + rise in the nucleus of
target cells triggers phosphorylation of the JAV1 transcriptional inhibi-
tor in a calmodulin-dependent manner. This change then targets
JAV1 for ubiquitinylation by the JUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and degrada-
tion by the 26S proteasome. Loss of JAV1 disrupts the inhibitory com-

repolarization
phase
of
electrical
signal
propagation
(Vodeneev et al., 2016). However, the specific H +-ATPases
involved have only recently begun to be defined. In
Arabidopsis, there are 12 H +-ATPases (AHAs) with AHA1-5
and -11 showing widespread expression throughout the
plant. AHA1 (predominately shoot) and -2 (predominately
root) are especially highly expressed (Gaxiola et al., 2007).
Mutants in AHA1, -2, and -3 were not originally thought to
play roles in wound-induced VPs (Mousavi et al., 2013).
However, recent analysis has shown that AHA1 is involved
in repolarization of the plasma membrane following a
wound-induced VP (Kumari et al., 2019). Additionally, in
aha1, the duration of the wound-triggered systemic Ca2 +
signal is extended, providing further mechanistic links be-
tween the Ca2 + wave, ion fluxes, and VP propagation. The
GLRs themselves are regulated by pH (Shao et al., 2020),
providing a further link between H + pumping and Ca2 + sig-
nal. Direct wounding is accompanied by cytosolic acidifica-
tion, suggesting a likely coupled apoplastic alkalinization
(Behera et al., 2018) that would be predicted to activate
plasma
membrane-localized
GLRs
(Shao
et
al.,
2020).
However, precisely how cytosolic and apoplastic pH change
as systemic signals propagate and how this might relate to
the activity of GLRs potentially acting in organelles as well
as at the plasma membrane remains to be defined.
aha2 mutants do not show equivalent disruption of the
wound VP, suggesting that only specific H +-ATPases may
be involved in supporting these kinds of electrical signals
(Kumari et al., 2019). The AHAs are known to controlled by
a complex network of elements, including interaction with
lipids, ions, protein kinases, and regulators such as 14-3-3
proteins (Falhof et al., 2016). Considering its central role in
wound VP dynamics, defining how the factors controlling
AHA1 activity relate to the generation of VPs could offer
important insight into the underlying regulatory networks
driving propagation of systemic signals.
Thus, there are some tantalizing clues as to how channels
and pumps may make contributions to different aspects of
systemic signals, such as to their thresholds or dynamics of
propagation. However, we must await a much more com-
prehensive exploration of the role(s) of the large number of
candidate channels, pumps, and exchangers to build a pic-
ture of the network of elements that are supporting the
fluxes of ions that underlie the systemic signaling network.
ROS: The great integrator?
In addition to Ca2 + waves and electrical signals, plants addi-
tionally employ waves of ROS (see Box 1) as part of their
systemic signaling apparatus. These waves are likely being
maintained through a ROS-induced ROS release machinery
(reviewed in Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018). As seen for sys-
temic electrical signals and the Ca2 + wave, the ROS wave
can propagate through both vascular and nonvascular tis-
sues, depending on the stimulus (Fichman et al., 2019; Lew
et al., 2020). For example, a wound-induced wave of ROS ac-
cumulation and response has been seen to move at speeds
in excess of 1 mm/s throughout the vasculature in aerial
parts of Arabidopsis (Miller et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019;
Lew et al., 2020), or at 400 mm/s in non-vascular tissues of
the root (Evans et al., 2016) and leaves (Lew et al., 2020; see
Table 1 and Choi et al. [2016] for summary of propagation
speeds). In Arabidopsis, these propagating ROS signals ap-
pear
dependent
on
RESPIRATORY

OXIDASE
HOMOLOGUE D (RBOHD) and RBOHF (Zandalinas et al.,
2020), both plasma membrane, ROS-producing NADPH oxi-
dases known to be central to a range of signaling systems
from pathogen defense to drought (Kadota et al., 2015). The
ROS wave is detected as both ROS production in the apo-
plast (Evans et al., 2016; Lew et al., 2020)—as expected for
the product of RBOH action—and in the cytoplasm (Miller
et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019; Zandalinas et al., 2020).
The observation of cytoplasmic changes implies either
RBOH-derived apoplastic ROS subsequently enter the cell
across the plasma membrane, likely through aquaporins
(Bienert et al., 2007; Dynowski et al., 2008), or that another,
cytoplasmic ROS producing system is also being engaged by
the systemic signaling network.
The Arabidopsis RBOH family shows regulation by a host
of modulators such as a wide range of kinases (including
members of the calcium-dependent protein kinase [CDPK]
and Calcineurin B-Like/CBL interacting protein kinase [CBL/
CIPK] families), small GTPases, and the lipid-based signal
phosphatidic acid (e.g. Kadota et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2017;
Lee et al., 2020). Of note, the CDPKs, the CBL/CIPKs, and
the RBOHs themselves are all directly regulated by Ca2 +.
Further, the stability of the RBOHD regulating BOTRYTUS
INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) is modulated through Ca2 +-de-
pendent regulation of CDPK action (Monaghan et al., 2014).
Thus, RBOH-based ROS production should be inextricably
linked with Ca2 + dynamics. Indeed, mathematical modeling
by Evans et al. (2016) supports the idea that it is the interac-
tion of ROS-induced Ca2 + influx at the plasma membrane
with the direct and indirect Ca2 + regulation of the RBOHs
that sustains cell-to-cell propagation of both the Ca2 + and
ROS waves.
A direct mechanistic relationship of ROS to the propagat-
ing systemic electrical signal remains less clear. In addition
to ROS production, RBOHs should alter both apoplastic pH
and membrane potential as they move an electron from cy-
tosolic NADPH to the apoplast in order to generate the su-
peroxide radical (see Box 1; Segal, 2016). However, whether
the magnitude of these effects is at all significant relative to
the activity of channels and pumps driving electrical changes
at the plasma membrane is unclear. There are also a num-
ber of identified channels and electrophysiologically mea-
sured membrane conductances where ROS regulation has
either been inferred or directly monitored, including SKOR,
GORK, the annexins, TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1; see
below), and the CNGCs (reviewed in Demidchik, 2018), pro-
viding hints at how ROS could modulate electrical signaling
phenomena. RBOHD function is known to be required for
the systemic propagation of high light- or heat stress-
induced VPs (Suzuki et al., 2013); however, a mutant in

Johns et al.

RBOHD did not alter wound-triggered VP characteristics in
Arabidopsis (Mousavi et al., 2013). Nonetheless, a RBOH
mutant in tomato does abolish wound-induced, root-to-
shoot VP transmission (Wang et al., 2019). Recent experi-
ments driving tissue-specific RBOHD expression in the
rbohD knockout background suggests that systemic signaling
to local high-light stress requires this enzyme to be located
in the xylem parenchyma or phloem (Zandalinas et al.,
2020). These are the same tissues where GLR3.3 and GLR3.6
are expressed and are required for systemic wound signaling
via VPs and Ca2 + (Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018).
Such observations reinforce the idea that plants are likely
employing complex and multifaceted propagation mecha-
nisms that may vary from organ to organ or stimulus to
stimulus.
ROS, RBOHD, and systemic signaling: it’s
complicated
The RBOHs are multigene families in plants. For example, in
Arabidopsis, there are eight other RBOH isoforms in addi-
tion to RBOHs D and F. Similarly, although the NADPH oxi-
dases have received the most attention as components of
this ROS-based systemic signaling network, ROS dynamics
are in reality modulated by a much more complex interplay
of ROS producing, degrading, and scavenging processes, in-
cluding respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport
and photorespiration, enzymatic systems involving superox-
ide dismutases, ascorbate peroxidases, catalases, glutathione
peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins, as well as the action of
non-enzymatic scavengers such as glutathione, ascorbic acid,
and flavonoids (Mittler et al., 2004; Smirnoff and Arnaud,
2019).
Further,
specific
receptors
for
ROS,
such
as
HYDROGEN

(HPCA1) are beginning to be defined (Wu et al., 2020).
Dissecting the potential roles of these other ROS-related ele-
ments in systemic signaling systems remains an important
goal for future research as it offers the possibility to provide
some of the missing linkages between Ca2 +, ROS, and elec-
trical responses.
Propagation of systemic signals also implies a directionality
to their transmission and here ROS regulation of tonoplast
channels could play a role. Thus, the systemic spread of
both the wound- (Kiep et al., 2015) and NaCl- (Choi et al.,
2014) driven systemic Ca2 + increases is known to involve
the action of a tonoplast channel, TPC1. Activation of
RBOHs produces apoplastic ROS that are then expected to
trigger ion fluxes (such as Ca2 + influx) at the plasma mem-
brane by gating currently unidentified channels (Demidchik,
Box 1 WHAT ARE THE RBOHS AND ROS?
The Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs (RBOHs) are a family of NADPH oxidases. Their enzymatic activity is to
take an electron from cytosolic NADPH and transfer it across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen to
produce the superoxide radical (see Box 1 ﬁgure). Superoxide dismutases then act on this highly chemically
reactive species to produce the much more stable H2O2 that can be further processed by catalase to produce
water and oxygen (Smirnoff and Arnaud, 2019). Superoxide and H2O2 are both forms of ROS, reactive chemical
species that contain oxygen. Other ROS include the hydroxyl radical, peroxides, and singlet oxygen. ROS are
produced during reactions within the cell and can cause damage to biological macromolecules such as proteins,
lipids, and nucleic acids due to their highly reactive nature. However, ROS are also used by biology as ubiquitous
signaling agents. For example, in Arabidopsis, HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE INDUCED Ca2 + INCREASE 1 (HPCA1)
is a plasma membrane leucine-rich receptor kinase that was recently discovered to link H2O2 perception in the
apoplast to Ca2 + signaling in the cytoplasm (Wu et al., 2020).

2018). TPC1 is then thought to act either directly or indi-
rectly to facilitate Ca2 + release from the vacuole, providing
an
amplifier
for
the
initial
cytosolic
Ca2 +
increases
(Figure 2). The resulting elevated cytosolic Ca2 + could then
further trigger RBOH activation, and so cause propagation
of the signal from cell to cell (Choi et al., 2014; Evans et al.,
2016). TPC1 is inhibited by cytosolic ROS (Pottosin et al.,
2009), suggesting a mechanism whereby the initial ROS pro-
duced by RBOH activation could enter the cell to inhibit
TPC1, leading to a refractory period for the calcium-induced
calcium release amplifier. The time delay between activation
of the RBOH/TPC1 system and ROS-dependent TPC1 inacti-
vation would then lead to the propagating, wave front-like
character to the transmission events. However, although
mutants in TPC1 disrupt systemic wound defense responses,
local wound-induced Ca2 + increases are not altered (Kiep
et al., 2015; Lenglet et al., 2017). In addition, although experi-
mental addition of ROS does trigger Ca2 + increases, the
resulting elevated Ca2 + and ROS levels do not propagate
systemically (Miller et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2016), suggesting
the model described above is likely missing some important
elements. For example, TPC1 appears to act in concert with
TANDEM PORE K + Channel 1 (TPK1) and -3 to mediate
electrical excitability of the tonoplast (Jaslan et al., 2019).
However, TPK1 and -3 are not thought to play roles in
wound-induced VP dynamics (Mousavi et al., 2013). Clearly,
we are just at the beginning of unraveling the complexities
and capabilities of the vacuole as a signaling hub.
Systemic responses: what happens at the finish line?
Following the propagation of a signal, the response in the
distal tissues ranges from the physiological, such as rapid
systemic stomatal responses (e.g. Devireddy et al., 2020;
Ehonen et al., 2020), alterations in photosynthetic activity
(Guo et al., 2016), and leaf movements (Kurenda et al.,
2019), to the molecular, with shifts in metabolites (Suzuki
et al., 2013; Choudhury et al., 2018), hormone levels (e.g.
Glauser et al., 2009; Koo et al., 2009; Toyota et al., 2018),
and gene expression levels (Suzuki et al., 2015; Zandalinas
et al., 2019). For example, in Arabidopsis, local high-light
exposure to a single Arabidopsis leaf triggers a systemic
change in metabolites such as glucose, sucrose, and glycine
within minutes, and a suite of transcriptional changes
within seconds (Suzuki et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2015;
Choudhury et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al., 2019). Both these
metabolic and transcriptional phenomena are dependent
on the action of RBOHD, again suggesting an integral role
for ROS in the signaling system. However, precisely where
the ROS are operating in the circuitry of signal generation,
propagation, and rapid response remains to be fully
defined.
Wound-induced JA production: integrating Ca2 +
and wound signaling responses
The response to the arrival of the systemic VP and Ca2 + sig-
nal triggered by wounding provides one example of the mo-
lecular machinery whereby systemic signaling molecules may
be fairly directly turned into the target cell response. In this
case, the systemic effect is a rapid (within minutes) increase
in the level of the wound hormone jasmonic acid (JA;
Glauser et al., 2009; Koo et al., 2009; Toyota et al., 2018).
Once the Ca2 + increase arrives at the systemic tissues, it
activates the Ca2 +-dependent regulatory protein calmodu-
lin, which in turn activates a protein kinase that phosphory-
lates JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ-MOTIF GENE1 (JAV1;
Figure 3, B and C; Yan et al., 2018). JAV1 is part of a repres-
sor complex that along with JAZ8 and WRKY51 inhibits ex-
pression of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE (AOS; encoding a key
enzyme in JA biosynthesis). The phosphorylation of JAV1
causes this complex to dissociate and triggers JAV1 ubiquiti-
nylation via the E3-ubiquitin ligase JAV1-ASSOCIATED
UBIQUITIN LIGASE 1 (JUL1), targeting JAV1 for degradation
by the 26S proteasome. The disruption of the inhibitory
complex removes repression of AOS transcription and so
leads to JA production. There are seven calmodulin genes in
Arabidopsis, which encode only four different proteins
(CaM1/4, -2/3/5, -6, and -7). In planta JAV1 interacts
strongly with CaM1/4 and CaM7, but not with the others
(Yan et al., 2018). CaM7 differs from CaM6 and CaM2/3/5
by a single, but different, amino acid, suggesting an exqui-
sitely tailored protein–protein interaction underlies response
to
the
arrival
of
the
systemic
Ca2 +
signal
in
this
system. Further, as discussed above, CNGC19 plays a role in
propagating the wound-induced Ca2 + wave. This channel is
also thought to be regulated by CaM, but in this case the
CaM2 isoform (Meena et al., 2019). Thus, different CaMs ap-
pear to be allowing the plant to both respond to the propa-
gating Ca2 + signal by supporting its transmission and also
to translate this same Ca2 + wave to the triggering of sys-
temic JA-mediated defenses once it arrives at its target.
Conclusion
Plants have evolved a complex series of local and systemic
signaling systems that allow the integration and coordina-
tion of their physiology and development. As early as the
1920s we knew that some of the most rapid of responses,
such as the leaflet movements in Mimosa, are associated
with electrical changes (Snow, 1923; Houwink, 1935). We are
now finding similar kinds of rapid, systemic signaling systems
in a wide variety of plants operating in response to stimuli
ranging from the leaf wounding caused by insect herbivory
to local high-light stress.
Although APs and VPs are intimately linked to plasma
membrane-related events, reflecting as they do ion move-
ments across this membrane, the important roles of the
vacuolar ion channel TPC1 and the potential for GLRs lo-
cated on intracellular membranes such as the tonoplast
and ER in systemic signaling highlight the likely role of
organelles in propagating these events. Both the ER and
the vacuole are emerging as important signaling hubs in
plants (Peiter, 2011; Scho¨nknecht, 2013; Liu and Li, 2019)
and we can expect that an intricate set of interactions be-
tween these organelles and the plasma membrane are

going to be important in systemic signal propagation.
Defining which channels are acting where, their orienta-
tions, and what ion fluxes they support are clearly key
pieces of information still needed to understand the
mechanisms underlying signal propagation. For example, a
plasma membrane locale of the relevant GLRs fits well
with the idea of the amino acid glutamate being a trigger
for systemic wound responses (Toyota et al., 2018). In this
model, cellular damage causes leakage of glutamate to the
apoplast that then triggers GLR action and supports the
Ca2 +
fluxes involved in systemic signal propagation.
Consistent with these ideas, in a GLR3.3- and GLR3.6-
dependent manner, local application of glutamate can
trigger both systemic spread of a Ca2 + increase and acti-
vation of JA defense responses throughout the plant
(Toyota et al., 2018). How then do GLRs on the organelles
play roles in this system? Where do the ligand binding
sites face? Are there cytoplasmic amino acid ligands in op-
eration or is some other gating mechanism at play?
Despite some major advances in defining molecular mech-
anisms in the last few years, our models of these systemic
signaling events are clearly still far from complete (see
Outstanding Questions). Other major open questions are
whether or not a simple Ca2 +/RBOH feedforward loop is
sufficient to explain rapid, systemic signal propagation or
whether there are multiple signaling networks tuned to
specific stimuli. How central is the vasculature as a high-
way for these signals and do such systems operate in con-
cert with a rapid hydraulic communication network? We
are only just beginning to dissect the molecular underpin-
nings of this electrical, ROS-based, ionic, and hydraulic sys-
temic signaling system(s), but we do know one thing
already, it is fast.
