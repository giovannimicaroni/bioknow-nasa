Collection and processing of tissues to preserve space flight effects from animals after return to Earth is challenging. Specimens
must be harvested with minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in protein expression/translation,
posttranslational modifications, and expression, as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after
euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for determining the window of optimal species-specific and
tissue-specific posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs. We
also determined methods for ISS-compatible long-term tissue storage (10 months at −80∘C) that yield recovery of high quality
mRNA and protein for western analysis after sample return. Our focus was reproductive tissues. The time following euthanasia
where tissues could be collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and species ranging between 1 and
3 hours. RNA quality was preserved in key reproductive tissues fixed in RNAlater up to 40 min after euthanasia. Postfixation
processing was also standardized for safe shipment back to our laboratory. Our strategy can be adapted for other tissues under
NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program or similar multi-investigator tissue sharing opportunities.
1. Introduction
With the current paucity of opportunities for studying whole
animal mammalian physiology in space flight, the Biospec-
imen Sharing Program (BSP) for postflight tissue collection
offers the opportunity to broaden access to biological samples
shortly after return and maximize the data generated from
flight animal payloads. The logistics of space flight experi-
ments involving live animals often requires harvesting tissues
at a remote site, followed by shipping the specimens to the
Principle Investigators’ laboratories for detailed analysis. Fur-
thermore, as the capabilities to house rodent and other animals
on the International Space station (ISS), and to conduct long-
term space flight experiments using animals are enabled, the
need to harvest and fix tissues for long-term storage on ISS
that will retain high quality RNA and protein for subsequent
analysis in laboratories on Earth is also required. These
approaches to live animal experimentation in space flight
that include tissue harvest for multiple investigators require
determination of (1) tissue-specific windows of time between
euthanasia and tissue fixation that retain quality of histology
and (2) tissue-specific windows of time for tissue fixation that
retain high quality protein and RNA for subsequent analysis.
Determination of these windows provides a quantitative,
logical approach to generate appropriately prioritized and
optimized tissue harvest and fixation logistics in a multi-
investigator Biospecimen Sharing Program scenario, be it on
Earth or during tissue harvest on the ISS. In addition, tissue

storage methods should retain high sample quality under
long-term storage, as samples may be harvested and stored on
the ISS but may not be returned to Earth for many months,
depending on ISS to Earth flight frequency and payload
capacities. This issue has been addressed for preserving plant
material for gene expression analysis [1], but there is no
data available for animal tissues. Our participation in the
BSP program involved tissue harvest from female mice at
Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA (KSC) for animals flown
for 12–15 days in orbit on three space shuttle flights: STS-131,
STS-133, and STS-135. In addition, we harvested tissues from
male mice at the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP)
laboratory in Moscow, RU for animals flown for 30 days
in orbit on the BION M1 satellite. Both the STS and BION
series of flight experiments involved age- and time-matched
ground control groups of animals. During the early flight
planning phase of BION, there were possibilities that male
or female mice would be flown and that male gerbil tissues
may also be provided to the BSP. Thus, to be prepared for any
of these possibilities, we undertook to determine the optimal
tissue harvest windows for all of the species and reproductive
tissues that we might be able to obtain. Our participation
in these multi-investigator specimen sharing efforts covering
four different primary flight PI experimental designs and
harvest logistics necessitated a determination of the window
of time between euthanasia and harvest and preservation of
our tissues of interest that would allow us sufficient flexibility
to obtain the highest possible quality of tissue for histopathol-
ogy, RNA for gene-transcription analysis, and protein for
expression and posttranslational modification analysis. A
determination of these time windows is essential, since the
tissues that are made available to the BSP investigators are
provided after the primary flight PI’s have obtained their tis-
sues. Knowledge of the optimal windows for all of the tissues
of interest aids in the preparation of targeted tissue harvest
flow logistics that can provide each of the BSP team members
the highest possible quality tissue, respectively. Therefore, as
we report here, we developed a strategy to determine the
window of time between euthanasia and fixation for retention
of high quality histology for male and female reproductive
organs. We also determined methods for long-term tissue
storage for 10 months that provide for recovery of both high
quality protein and RNA. These strategies are adaptable and
can be applied to harvest and storage of other time-sensitive
labile tissues from animals and plants. Furthermore, these
methods can be used to optimize logistics and data collection
under multi-investigator tissue harvest and sharing programs
operated by any space agency, commercial entity, or flight
platform.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals. Approximately 8 wk old male and female
C57Bl/6J (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) and ∼10-month old
male and female Mongolian gerbils (Charles River, Wilming-
ton, MA) were used throughout this study. All animal use
protocols were approved by the University of Kansas Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animals
were maintained in standard cages with 12 : 12 h dark : light
cycle, and standard food and water were provided ad libitum.
All animals were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation fol-
lowed by cervical dislocation prior to tissue harvest.
2.2. Determination of the Limit of Time and
Temperature between Euthanasia and Tissue Fixation
2.2.1. Male Mice. Our protocol consisted of three groups of
six mice each, with one mouse for each time point. In group
A, all mice were euthanized at one time and the testes and
epididymides were harvested and separated and then imme-
diately placed in Ham’s F-10 medium (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) on ice. At time intervals of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and
2.5 hr each testis (one mouse per time point) and epididymis
(2 mice per time point) were separated and then transferred
from Ham’s F-10 medium to Bouin’s fixative (Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) at room temperature (RT; 21∘C). In group B,
the same procedure was followed, except that the testes and
epididymides, separated, were placed in Ham’s F-10 medium
at RT until transfer to Bouin’s at the same time interval as
above. In group C, all mice were euthanized at one time, the
carcasses were maintained at (RT), and then at time 0, 0.5, 1.0,
1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hr, the testis and epididymis were harvested
from the carcasses, respectively. At each of the time points
above, group C testes were placed in Bouin’s solution and pro-
cessed as per standard histology protocols, as detailed below.
For all groups, the tissues fixed in Bouin’s were processed as
detailed in Section 2.3, below. At the same time point, group
C epididymides were processed to obtain cauda sperm to
assess sperm motility by computer assisted sperm analysis
(CASA) [2]. For animals used for collection of cauda epi-
didymal sperm for motility analysis, two animals were used at
each time point.
2.2.2. Female Mice. Female mice were euthanized (carcasses
maintained at RT as per group C, above) and their ovaries and
uteri were harvested at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 hr after
euthanasia (one animal per time point). At the times indi-
cated, the tissues were fixed at RT in Bouin’s overnight and
then processed for histology as detailed below (Section 2.3).
2.2.3. Mongolian Gerbils. The six male gerbils were euth-
anized at one time, and the carcasses were kept at room
temperature. At 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 hr after euthanasia,
testis and epididymis were harvested from the carcasses and
separated, respectively (one animal per time point). Similarly,
all six female gerbils were euthanized and the carcasses were
kept at RT. Ovaries and uterine horns were harvested from
each carcass at the same time interval as the males. At the
times indicated above, the tissues were placed in Bouin’s fixa-
tive at RT and then processed for histology, as detailed below
(Section 2.3). Sperm were immediately harvested from cauda
epididymis as mentioned above, and sperm motility analysis
was carried out using CASA, as described above [2].
2.3. Postharvest Processing of Mouse Testicular Tissues. Testes
and epididymides from the mature mice were harvested, as

detailed above. Unless indicated otherwise, all procedures
were done at RT. Tissues were fixed in Bouin’s solution for
48 h, washed in 70% ethanol (ETOH) until the yellow color
of Bouin’s disappeared (∼48 hr with frequent changes of 70%
ETOH and gentle agitation), and divided into four groups:
Control group: tissue was stored in 70% ETOH until paraffin
embedding; Rapid transition: 70% ETOH was immediately
replaced with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), pH 7.4
for one wk, and then rapidly replaced with 70% ETOH;
Slow Re-ETOH only: 70% ETOH was immediately replaced
with PBS for one wk and then sequentially replaced at 2 hr
intervals with each of 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% ETOH; Slow
rehydration-dehydration: 70% ETOH was sequentially (70%,
50%, 30%, 10%, then PBS, at 2 hr each) substituted with PBS
for one wk and then replaced at 2 hr intervals with each of
10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% ETOH. To prevent contamination,
we kept tissue in PBS at 4∘C, and ETOH replacement was
completed at RT with 2 hr intervals between changes, as
detailed above. After each of the respective final dehydration
steps above, the tissues were paraffin-embedded and pro-
cessed for histology and hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE)
using standard methods as performed previously [3].
2.4. Total RNA Extraction and Preservation. Freshly harves-
ted mouse testes were immediately stabilized in 10 volumes
of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or RNAlater
solution (Ambion, Austin, TX). The samples placed in
RNAlater were stored for (1) two wks at 4∘C; (2) one wk at RT
and one wk at 4∘C; or (3) two wks at RT. Before RNA
extraction, tissues were retrieved from RNAlater solution
with sterile forceps and then submerged in TRIzol reagent.
RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Time of placement into RNAlater was
noted to determine if RNA quality was related to the duration
of window from euthanasia to placement in RNAlater. RNA
integrity and quantity were determined using Agilent RNA
kit and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Santa Clara, CA). One 𝜇g of
RNA was subjected to RT PCR with the primers specific for
mouse GAPDH (Forward: 5󸀠CCTTCATTGACCTCAAC-
TAC; Reverse: 5󸀠ATGACAAGCTTCCCATTCTC), and inte-
rleukin-1alpha (IL-1𝛼) (Forward: 5󸀠ACTTGTTTGAAGAC-
CTAAAG; Reverse: 5󸀠GTTTCAGAGGTTCTCAGAG). Pri-
mers were designed using online Primer Design Tool Primer
3. Uteri and ovaries from STS-135 were harvested in RNAlater
solution and stored at −80∘C for 10 months. Total RNA was
isolated from ovaries and uterine horns with Gene Elute
Mammalian RNA kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). PCR
products were verified on 3.0% agarose gels using standard
procedures.
2.5. Protein Extraction from Ovaries and Uterus Tissue Pre-
served in RNAlater. Ovaries stabilized in RNAlater for one
wk at RT and two wks at 4∘C were used for protein extrac-
tion. The tissue was removed from RNAlater, briefly rinsed
with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then homogenized in RIPA
buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (all from Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or ProteoJet Mammalian Cell Lysis
Reagent (Fermentas, Pittsburgh, PA). Uteri from STS-135
mission mice were preserved in RNAlater for 10 months at
−80∘C, prior to processing in RIPA as described above. Pro-
tein concentration was determined using the DC Assay (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA), and 15 𝜇g protein was electrophoresed
under denaturing conditions on 4–15% polyacrylamide gel
and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Her-
cules, CA). The membranes were blocked for 1 hr with 5%
nonfat milk in TBS-T (Tris buffered saline with Tween-20,
Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and probed with 1 𝜇g/mL rabbit
anti-mouse estrogen receptor alpha (ER𝛼) antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA). To verify equal loading of proteins,
membranes were stripped and reprobed with a goat anti-𝛽-
actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Incubations
with primary antibodies were carried out overnight at 4∘C.
After washing in TBS-T and probing with the corresponding
horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), bound antibodies were iden-
tified using Amersham ACL Plus Western Blotting Detection
Reagents (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and luminography.
Western blots were quantitated by densitometric analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of Delayed Processing on Quality of Mouse and
Gerbil Reproductive Tissue Histology
3.1.1. Male Mouse. Testes harvested any time between time
0 after euthanasia up to 2.5 hr after euthanasia showed
histological properties comparable to the time 0-harvested
mice. For comparative purposes, the 0 min harvested testes
represent the control for subsequent time points for each
storage treatment, respectively. Histological quality of the
testes was excellent in all postharvest treatment procedures;
namely, tissues were kept in the carcass until fixation or fixed
in Bouin’s immediately or stored in Hams F10 on ice or RT
before fixation. Testis tubules appeared normal in all treat-
ment groups compared to the 0 min controls, with no
shrinkage of tissue and complete retention of histologic archi-
tectural details (Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c)).
Total motility and progressive motility of cauda epididymal
mouse sperm at times 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 hr were not
significantly different between any of the tissue harvest time
points and also not significantly different between the three
tissue harvest scenarios. Table 1 shows the percent progressive
motility for each time point under all three tissue storage
conditions. Table 2 shows the percent total motility for each
time point under all three tissue storage conditions. Based on
comparable results between the three tissue harvest regimens,
we focused on the “tissue in carcass” at RT regimen for
subsequent experiments with female mice, as well as male and
female gerbils.
3.1.2. Male Gerbil. Testis showed normal distinct histological
details with all spermatogenic cells arranged in a normal pat-
tern in the tubule when collected up to 2.5 hr after euthanasia
(Figure 2). Total motility of the gerbil cauda epididymal
sperm harvested at each at time point was analyzed and is
presented in Table 3. Since the data represent a single animal,

healthy oocytes devoid of signs of tissue degradation; how-
ever at 1.5 hr after euthanasia high numbers of unhealthy fol-
licles and shrunken oocytes were seen, suggesting tissue dete-
rioration due to the delay in fixation process after euthanasia.
Significantly high numbers of “vacuoles-like” structures were
also seen at 1.5 hr after euthanasia (Figure 3(d)), which is
indicative of tissue degradation (indicated by the yellow cir-
cles). Control (0 min) gerbil ovaries had negligible “vacuoles”
(indicated by two black arrows). The ovary harvested after
1.5 hr did not sustain the histological processing as they were
too fragile and degraded, implying that gerbil ovaries were
more sensitive and should be harvested within 1 hr of euth-
anasia. Uterine histology indicated tissues were intact and
comparable to control at all tested time points (Figure 3(e)).

was evaluated for histological changes after different post-
fixation processing (Figures 4 and 5). In control testicular
tissue (Figure 4(a)), all types of spermatogenic cells, sper-
matogonia (Sp), Sertoli cells (Se), spermatocytes (Sc), and
spermatids (Sd), were evident. Lymphatic spaces between
seminiferous tubules and adjacent to Leydig cells (L) clusters
are clearly defined. After the slow rehydration-dehydration
stepwise replacement with ETOH, testis tubules appeared
normal with histological architecture similar to the control
group (Figure 4(b)). Although all types of spermatogenic cell
were identified after slow rehydration-dehydration stepwise
replacement, spermatogonia and Sertoli cell nuclei were more
difficult to distinguish compared to control. The quality of
testicular histology observed after slow Re-ETOH only (Fig-
ure 4(c)) was similar to that observed in the slow rehydration-
dehydration stepwise replacement group. However, open
spaces (black arrows) were observed within portions of
seminiferous tubules in the slow Re-ETOH only group, and
the seminiferous tubule basement membrane in this group
often appeared wavy and thinner (yellow arrows) compared
to the control (Figure 4(a)). The histologic quality was poor in
the group treated by single step (rapid transition) change of
solution (Figure 4(d)), as evidenced by a diffuse appearance of
the tissue (not due to focus) and limited clarity of nuclear
details in spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. In addition, the
seminiferous tubule basement membrane was occasionally
indistinct and some spermatid artifactual loss of residual
bodies is also observed.
We found epididymal tissue to be sensitive to dehy-
dration/rehydration shock (Figure 5). Slow rehydration-
dehydration ETOH replacement had no visible negative effect
on the quality of epididymal morphology (Figure 5(b)); how-
ever histological examination revealed differences in epi-
didymal morphology after slow Re-ETOH only (Figure 5(c))
and rapid transition procedures (Figure 5(d)), compared to
control (Figure 5(a)). The differences included alterations in
the thickness of columnar epithelium, and basal and principal
cells are not very sharp. The slow rehydration-dehydration
caused less destruction of testicular and epididymal tissue
than the rapid single-step changes of solution and has an
overall better morphological detail preservation compared to
the rapid ETOH-PBS solution change.
3.3. Total RNA and Protein Evaluation after Tissue
Preservation in RNAlater under Long-Term Storage
3.3.1. RNA Stability. We compared RNA integrity after
preservation testicular tissue in TRIzol reagent and RNAlater
(Figure 6(a)). Total RNA integrity analysis demonstrated high
quality RNA after storing tissue in RNAlater for 1-2 wk at RT
or 4∘C compared to TRIzol preservation. Distinct 28S and 18S
ribosomal RNA and absence of degraded RNA were observed
on the gel. RT-PCR analysis of RNA with primers for GAPDH
and IL-1𝛼indicated high quality of expected PCR products in
all analyzed samples (Figure 6(b)). Integrity analysis of total
RNA isolated from STS-131 ground controls (G10, G11, and
G12) and flight (F10, F11, and F12) mouse uteri after 30 to
40 min after euthanasia demonstrate high RNA quality in
these samples (Figure 6(c)). We found no differences in RNA
quality between all analyzed uteri and ovaries samples placed
into RNAlater from 15 min to 40 min after euthanasia.

3.3.2. Long-Term Storage for RNA Analysis. Using ovary and
uteri harvested from STS 135 mice, we also determined the
effect of long-term (10 months) preservation in RNAlater on
RNA and protein quality (Figure 7). This time frame was
chosen to mimic a possible storage scenario that could occur
on the ISS. Ovaries and uterus from STS-135 ground controls
stabilized in RNAlater for 10 months showed excellent RNA
quality (Figure 7(a)) and yield in range 6–8 𝜇g.
3.3.3. Protein Stability. Although not commonly done, tissue
stabilized in RNAlater can be used for subsequent protein
extraction. Protein obtained from samples stored in RNAlater
is suitable for western blotting or 2D gel electrophoresis, but
not for applications that require native protein (Ambion
Guideline for RNAlater). We optimized the protocol for pro-
tein extraction from ovaries preserved in RNAlater for one
wk at RT or two wks at 4∘C by using RIPA buffer or ProteoJet
Lysis reagent (LR). Western analysis of 𝛽-actin integrity
demonstrated that one wk ambient storage of testicular tissue
in RNAlater did not affect actin integrity as evidenced by the
absence of proteolytic fragments and consistent signal inten-
sity in replicate samples (Figure 6(d)).
3.3.4. Long-Term Storage for Protein Analysis. Protein from
uteri stabilized in RNAlater for 10 months after STS-135
mission was extracted with RIPA buffer. Immunoblot for
ER𝛼and 𝛽-actin verified excellent expression levels of both
proteins with no evidence of proteolytic degradation of both
proteins (Figure 7(b)). Quantitative densitometry analysis of
western blots indicated reduced levels ER𝛼in mostly flight
animals. These results demonstrate that RNAlater is an
effective sample collection and stabilization reagent for pro-
tecting both RNA and protein under long-term conditions
compatible for the ISS.
4. Discussion
We report here a logical method to determine the optimal
time window of tissue harvest and fixation after euthanasia
for use in multi-investigator tissue harvest programs that is
compatible with processing of tissue sample obtained from
space flight animals. We also demonstrate here a long-term
storage regimen for animal tissues compatible with recovery
of high quality RNA and protein under conditions similar to
that on the ISS, when there may be many months between
sample collection and return to Earth. The procedures set
forth also include methods for tissue harvest at the site of
return and for safe shipment to external laboratories for
further processing for histopathology and recovery of protein
and RNA. Several fixation/preservation studies have been
carried out for plant samples [1, 4, 5]. One European Space
Agency report included a brief discussion on fixation of
mammalian cells in tissue culture for microscopy [6]. Freidin
et al. [7] have demonstrated significant alterations on gene
expression in lung carcinoma tissues collected about 30
minutes after harvest. Durrenberger et al. [8] reported that,
in human brain samples collected from several brain banks,
antemortem events appeared to negatively affect the RNA
quality, but postmortem delays caused no significant dete-
rioration. This observation supported earlier report that

postmortem delay had negligible effect on RNA quality [9].
Human stomach has been described as the tissue showing
the earliest sign of postmortem [10]. Presnell and Cina
described stomach and pancreas as the earliest human tissues
to deteriorate following death [11]. The significance of quick
processing of histopathological specimen in a clinical setting
has been identified by Rohr et al. [12]. However, we have
not come across similar studies for animal tissues used in
biomedical research. Prior to our study reported here, there
was a significant knowledge gap in the literature for methods
to process animal tissues compatible for multi-investigator
Biospecimen Sharing Programs for space flight logistical sce-
narios. For our flight studies, using male and female mice on
three different space shuttle flights and the BION M1 flight, it
was critical to determine the optimum conditions of tissue
harvest and processing for tissues of our interest, namely,
testis, epididymis, ovary, and uteri.
Space flight studies usually comprise remotely dispersed
multi-investigator collaborations. Thus, there is a need to ship
tissue samples from the site of collection at the return-to-
Earth laboratory facility for initial tissue harvest to the site of
final processing and detailed data collection. With respect to
collection of RNA samples, TRIzol reagent gives excellent
RNA integrity; however it is a phenol-based solution and
tissue preserved in TRIzol cannot be shipped internationally
due to airline safety restrictions. Lyophilization of fresh tissue
specimen has been shown to preserve RNA and protein qual-
ity and levels by Wu et al. [13]. Though lyophilization makes
shipping easier, especially across international borders, it
is not a viable option for preservation of highest quality
histological analysis. To obtain optimum RNA and protein
quality, our results demonstrate that mouse testicular tissue
can be submerged in RNAlater and stored successfully for
analysis at a later time point, at least 10 months at −80∘C. It
should be noted that 10 months represents a minimum limit,
and longer storage intervals would still need to be directly
assessed. Given the current estimate for ISS SpaceX Dragon
flights at approximately 3-month intervals, this would span

three opportunities for sample return after an experiment
is terminated and ensure maintenance of RNA and protein
sample quality. It is known that, in order to isolate high quality
RNA and protein from mammalian tissue, the tissue must
be processed directly after harvest. We determined, for our
tissues of interest, that excellent RNA stability was achieved if
the tissue samples were placed into RNAlater up to 40 min
after euthanasia. RNAlater is a popular reagent that inac-
tivates all cellular enzymes, including RNAses; thus RNA
expression profiles can be preserved in situations when
immediate RNA isolation is not feasible. The tissue can be
stored in RNAlater for a long time without nucleic acid deg-
radation. RNAlater has been used by investigators for col-
lection of human tissue [14] and used in RNA expression
microarrays [15]. Our results indicated that RNAlater enables
long-term tissue preservation for RNA and protein extraction
compatible with delayed sample return from flight. This
process should be evaluated for use on other tissues to max-
imize optimal histology and gene transcription data collec-
tion in the primary flight experiments as well as the Biospec-
imen Sharing Programs (BSP) investigators. Freidin et al. [7]
have confirmed the significance of RNAlater as a medium to
preserve gene expression of lung tissues. Tissue processing
methods should be standardized for best storage and analysis
of harvested tissues. Our methods for tissue fixation, long-
term storage, and recovery of protein and RNA are compati-
ble for planned in-flight tissue harvest on ISS.
With regard to obtaining the best possible tissue fixation
for histology collected under a multi-investigator Biospec-
imen Sharing Program, obtaining many tissues of interest
to the participating investigators has to be considered in an
integrated way to accommodate the scientific requirements
of the overarching flight project, as well as the natural degra-
dation process that tissues undergo as soon as euthanasia has
occurred. Depending on the tissue and species, different
windows of time from euthanasia to fixation may exist within
which histological architecture (as well as RNA and protein
integrity) is stable. In the study design reported here, we have
determined the window of time and temperature for optimal
postharvest maintenance of male and female tissue quality
(testis, epididymis, ovary, and uterine horn) and sperm via-
bility in mice and gerbils. These harvest protocols provide a
logical method for integrating the tissue flow logistics for
postflight animals for any project involving multiple inves-
tigators. Protocols compatible with investigators who require
more rapid tissue retrieval can be identified and prioritized to
ensure data preservation. We determined that mouse testes
were able to retain excellent histological details when pro-
cessed up to 3 hr after euthanasia. Sperm motility showed
gradual decline with time. The authors would reiterate as
mentioned in the Results section that sperm motility is a
highly sensitive and variable parameter. It is normal to see
major differences in motility of sperm obtained from not only
one mouse to another, but also within samples obtained from
the same mouse or gerbil. Nonetheless, even within the span
of variability seen, our results indicate that, in case of mouse,
there was no major difference in sperm motility between any
of the time points, whereas in case of gerbil, we saw sug-
gestions of a slight drop at 2.5 hr after harvest. Future studies
for flight will require analysis of larger 𝑛’s during definition

phase, if gerbils will be used. Of the tissues studied here,
Mongolian gerbil ovaries appear most sensitive to delay in
processing, and require more rapid posteuthanasia process-
ing than mouse ovaries. Determining optimum conditions
for tissue handling after harvest is very crucial and can help in
maximizing tissue retrieval form animal models thereby
maximizing data output. Based on the time-sensitivity, inves-
tigators may be able to plan the sequence in which the tissues
are harvested starting with the most sensitive tissue to least
sensitive.
Finally, with regard to the requirement to ship tis-
sues fixed for histopathology, airline and ground transport
providers (especially international carriers) have specific
safety regulations that prohibit shipment of samples contain-
ing many widely used fixatives and preservatives of tissue
histologic integrity. Science requirements may present chal-
lenges in using alternative fixatives. In this regard, Bouin’s
fixative (which contains picric acid) is the best fixative for the
testis if the tissue is to be embedded in paraffin [16]. However,
in space flight experiments, safety regulations prevent its use
on flight platforms and its presence in tissue samples being
shipped. Thus, we optimized protocols for fixative removal
and storage of tissues in PBS for safe shipping, as well as
reconstitution protocols for storing tissues in 70% ethanol to
retain excellent histology.
5. Conclusion
Optimal time frames for harvesting testis, epididymis, ovary,
and uteri without compromising the histological quality,
sperm motility, and RNA quality have been determined.
Differences in tissue-specific optimal fixation time windows
were noted between mice and gerbils. We provide here new
methods for (1) fixative removal and transfer of tissues into
aqueous media for safe shipping and (2) reconstitution proto-
cols into 70% ethanol that retains excellent histology. We con-
clude that stepwise replacement of ETOH-PBS-ETOH caused
less degradation of histological quality of tissue than a single-
step change of solution. Our results demonstrate that male
and female mouse reproductive tissues stored in RNAlater
solution were stable and gave high quality RNA and protein
after 10 months of storage at −80∘C. Thus, we have determined
methods for postharvest tissue processing to replace Bouin’s
with 70% ethanol for safe shipping across USA and also
replace 70% ethanol with PBS to enable shipping of tissues
across international borders. These protocols will facilitate
integration of tissue harvest logistics in multi-investigator
Biospecimen Sharing Programs for optimal tissue histology
and retention of high quality RNA and protein recovery from
animal tissues on long-term space flight experiments on ISS
as well as other flight platforms.
