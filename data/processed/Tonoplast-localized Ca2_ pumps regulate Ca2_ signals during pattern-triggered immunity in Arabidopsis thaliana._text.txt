One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid
influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol following pathogen recognition.
Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous el-
ements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode
stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and fre-
quency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bac-
terial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca2+ transients, there remain
limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca2+ transporters
involved in shaping the cellular Ca2+ dynamics during the trigger-
ing of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited
Ca2+-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca2+ from the cytosol
have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar
members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic pheno-
types. We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized
pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling and
related defense responses. The double-knockout aca4/11 exhibited
increased basal Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ signals of higher amplitude than
wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca2+ dynamics and associated
defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing the
aca4/11 seedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8
from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tono-
plast also suppressed the aca4/11 phenotypes but not when a cata-
lytically inactive mutant was used. These observations indicate that
regulation of vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration is an integral component of
plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-
localized Ca2+ pumps does not require specific regulatory elements
not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps.

P
lant pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment and plants
have evolved sensory systems to recognize their presence and
trigger appropriate defense responses. One of the best charac-
terized of these sensing networks is through plasma membrane
localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bind
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): That is, con-
served molecular signals of pathogen presence, such as bacterial
flagellin or fungal chitin. Upon PAMP-binding, the PRRs trigger
an immune response termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) that
can lead to the rapid development of both local and plant-wide
defense (systemic acquired resistance) (1). The best-characterized
of the PRRs is the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase flagellin-
sensitive 2 (FLS2). This protein acts with a coreceptor, BAK1, and
is responsible for recognizing bacterial flagellin (or minimally the
flg22 peptide epitope within flagellin) (2, 3) and triggers the sig-
naling systems that lead to PTI.
Induction of these local and systemic responses involves the
activation of myriad cellular signaling events at sites of pathogen
perception, such as protein phosphorylation cascades, production
of reactive oxygen species, anion fluxes, and apoplastic alkaliza-
tion (1, 4–6). One of these major hallmarks of early PTI responses
is a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol immediately after PAMP
recognition. The subsequent change in cytosolic Ca2+ level is then
thought to play a role in triggering downstream responses (7–9).
Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous
elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode
stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and
frequency: Their so-called “calcium signature” (10). Calcium sig-
natures are determined by an interplay between Ca2+ permeable
channels, exchangers, and pumps (11). Two cyclic nucleotide-
gated channels (CNGCs 2 and 4) have emerged as likely key
players in the Ca2+ influx supporting the flg22-triggered signaling
system under nonlimiting soil Ca2+ levels (12). However, other
channels are likely also involved as the cngc2/4 double mutant
attenuates, but does not abolish, the flg22-induced Ca2+ change.
Similarly, although CNGC2 and -4 are thought to mediate Ca2+
influx at the plasma membrane, whether release from internal
Ca2+ stores plays a major role in these signaling events remains to
be fully characterized. Despite this important role for channels in
generating such defense-related Ca2+ signals, building evidence
also suggests an important role for Ca2+ efflux pumps in innate
immune Ca2+ signaling. In particular, mutants of P2B-type ATPases,
or autoinhibited calcium ATPases (ACAs) (13), have been shown
to exhibit aberrant patterns of PTI (14, 15).
Significance
Ca2+ signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant im-
mune responses. We show that when the bacterial elicitor
peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants
missing tonoplast Ca2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca2+ signals
that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type
plants. Relocalization of a Ca2+ pump normally found in the
plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast
pump knockout mutant’s immune-related phenotypes and
aberrant Ca2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support
the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the
proper maintenance of Ca2+ dynamics in innate immune re-
sponses but that any regulatory systems specific to the en-
dogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support
these signaling events.

Thus, mutants in the Arabidopsis plasma membrane ACAs,
ACA8 and ACA10, show impaired defense and attenuated flg22-
induced Ca2+ signals. Conversely, disruption of the tonoplast
ACAs, ACA4 and ACA11, renders plants to be constitutively
defense responsive, but whether these phenotypes are related to
aberrations in Ca2+ signaling remains unknown (14). We report
that aca4/11 mutants show elevated basal Ca2+ and an increased
Ca2+ signal in response to flg22. Elevated temperature is known
to suppress defense-response phenotypes and growth at high
temperatures rescued both the altered Ca2+ dynamics and ab-
errant downstream pathogen responses. Furthermore, we report
that the relocalization of a plasma membrane ACA (ACA8) to
the tonoplast rescues the aca4/11 phenotype. These observations
imply that tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumping is integral to main-
taining homeostatic Ca2+ levels and for the initiation of proper
PTI responses. However, because the relocalized plasma mem-
brane pump can rescue the tonoplast knockout phenotypes, any
regulatory motifs specific to the tonoplast pumps may not be re-
quired to support normal Ca2+ signaling in the flg22-triggered
response network.
Results
aca4/11 Leaves Exhibit Elevated Baseline Ca2+ Levels. The aca4/11
tonoplast ACA pump knockout shows an enhanced defense re-
sponse, but its effects on Ca2+ dynamics are unstudied (14). We
therefore monitored cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics in aca4/11 plants
expressing the ratiometric, genetically encoded, fluorescent protein-
based Ca2+ sensor YC-Nano65 (16). As Ca2+ levels increase, the
cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) signal from YC-Nano65 falls and
the FRET signal from the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) partner
in the sensor increases. An increasing change in the FRET:CFP
ratio (ΔR) therefore reflects increasing cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]Cyt).
aca4/11 mutants spontaneously form lesions around the time of
inflorescence bolting, so we only imaged plants that had not yet
developed lesions to mitigate potential imaging artifacts from
dead cells. We obtained the mean FRET:CFP ratio values over
3 h for entire rosette leaves of Col-0 and aca4/11 and observed a
significant elevation in baseline [Ca2+]Cyt in aca4/11 plants
(Fig. 1). Similarly, we tested [Ca2+]Cyt values in intact and de-
tached cotyledons of 10-d-old seedlings and observed a similar
pattern of basal [Ca2+]Cyt elevation in aca4/11 (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1). Such a sustained Ca2+ elevation may be associated with lesion
formation as the infiltration of leaves with an avirulent strain of
the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000
(Pst) has also been reported to elicit sustained Ca2+ elevations
that preceded hypersensitive lesion formation (17–19).
flg22-Dependent Ca2+ Signals Are Elevated in aca4/11. The forma-
tion of spontaneous hypersensitive lesions is a characteristic of
lesion-mimic mutants and indicative of a deregulated immune
response (20), implying that aca4/11 may be showing a similar
disruption in defense signaling. Thus, we decided to test the
Ca2+ signaling response to the PAMP flg22 (2, 3, 5, 21) in the
aca4/11 background. We first established that 1 μM flg22 elicited
a clear Ca2+ increase in Col-0 and was below the saturating
concentration for the response (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Using this
1-μM concentration as our treatment, we found that flg22 eli-
cited a larger Ca2+ increase in aca4/11 rosette leaves and coty-
ledons when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 2, SI Appendix, Fig. S3, and
Movies S1–S4), suggesting that tonoplast-localized ACAs are
important for the proper efflux of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm
during signaling events related to PAMP perception. ACA4 and
ACA11 are ubiquitously expressed (22), as is the FLS2 receptor,
and so we asked whether Ca2+ signaling in response to flg22 was
generically disrupted in the double-mutant background in our
experiments to help us focus on where ACA4- and ACA11-
dependent events were likely to be most prominent. Therefore,
we grew plants under the same conditions where aca4/11 showed
differences in the flg22-triggered cotyledon Ca2+ response but
assayed responses in the root. SI Appendix, Fig. S4 shows that we
could detect both the previously documented flg22-induced in-
hibition of root growth (23) and flg22-triggered Ca2+ increase at
the root tip (24) in wild-type Col-0 seedlings, indicating that
seedling roots were indeed flg22-responsive under these condi-
tions. However, neither of these flg22-induced responses were
significantly different between aca4/11 and Col-0 (SI Appendix,
Fig. S4 A–C). Furthermore, and unlike the shoot tissue, the
baseline [Ca2+]Cyt in aca4/11 root tips was not significantly dif-
ferent to Col-0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), suggesting a potentially
smaller impact on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis of loss of ACA4
and ACA11 function at the root tip than in the shoot of these
plants.
It is important to note here that our results do not rule out a
regulatory role for ACA4 and ACA11 in root Ca2+ signaling and
defense response. For example, flg22 responses in regions out-
side of the root tip or in plants of different ages or grown under
different conditions may be altered in the aca4/11 background.
However, these results are consistent with Behera et al. (25),
who similarly saw no shift in baseline Ca2+ and little effect on
root tip Ca2+ signaling in response to exogenous ATP in aca4/11
roots. Taking these observations together suggested to us that
focusing on analyses of shoot rather than root responses should
be the most likely to reveal aca4/11-dependent events. Thus, since
our results indicated that aca4/11 defense-signaling phenotypes
appear prominent in the shoot tissue, where the lesion-mimic
phenotype manifests, and are evident in both mature leaves and
cotyledons, we decided to concentrate subsequent analyses on
these aerial parts of the plant, using the cotyledons as our major
organ for assay of Ca2+ responses.
The whole-organ imaging we used to capture the responses
quantified in Fig. 2 does not resolve individual cells and so in-
evitably includes some degree of averaging over multiple respond-
ing cells. Thus, the aca4/11-related changes in the Ca2+ signal
dynamics seen in the aerial organs in response to flg22 described
above could reflect: 1) All of the cells being measured showing a
similar elevated flg22-triggered rise in Ca2+, or 2) most aca4/11
cells behaving with the wild type-like response but with a subset
showing a much bigger response. In order to discriminate between
these possibilities for the altered Ca2+ response in the aca4/11
background, we used confocal ratio imaging to follow changes after
flg22 addition with single-cell resolution. This approach allowed us

to ask how uniform the cellular response was in the aca4/11 plants.
Fig. 3 shows that the elevated response appears homogeneous
within responding cells (Fig. 3A) and is mirrored in both individual
cellular response in different regions across the organ and in the
average response of a subregion of the cotyledon (Fig. 3 B and C).
These results are consistent with the effect of the aca4/11 lesion
leading to a general elevation of Ca2+ response in all cells rather
than reflecting novel responses of a subpopulation.
Elevated Temperature Suppresses Lesion Formation and flg22-Dependent
Ca2+ Signals in aca4/11. Many lesion-mimic mutants exhibit lesion
suppression when grown in elevated temperatures (20, 26), likely
due to reduced biosynthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid
(27). While aca4/11 plants grown at 22 °C exhibited dwarfism and
eventually formed lesions, growth at 28 °C suppressed both of
these aca4/11 phenotypes, an effect that became more obvious as
the plants grew larger rosettes (Fig. 4A). We also used molecular
markers of the flg22 response to characterize how aca4/11 may
affect induction of defense pathways. We first characterized that
in wild-type, a 30-min time point after flg22 treatment captured
the induction of CPB60g, PHI1, ICS1, and FRK1, all components
of PTI induction (28, 29). We also confirmed that the basal ex-
pression of these genes was not significantly altered in the various
genotypes or under the temperature regimes used in the absence
of flg22 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Importantly, FRK1 encodes a
receptor-like protein kinase that is thought to function in a

pathway independent of the flg22-signaling events mediated
through the Ca2+-dependent protein kinases CPK4, -5, -6, and -11
(29). Thus, FRK1 provided us with a marker that may operate
independently of Ca2+ signal dynamics, and so of aca4/11-related
effects. Indeed, we observed that the 30-min flg22-dependent in-
crease in FRK1, PHI1, and ICS1 transcripts were unaltered in the
aca4/11 background when compared to wild-type Col-0 plants
(Fig. 4B). However, induction of the defense regulator CBP60g
and resistance to Pst bacterial challenge (seen as a reduction in
extractable colony forming units of bacteria) were both elevated in
aca4/11 plants, with the resistance phenotype being most evident
over the initial invasion at 1 d postinoculation (1 DPI) (Fig. 4C).
As seen for the dwarfing phenotype, suppression of both flg22-
induced elevation of defense gene induction and pathogen resis-
tance occurred in aca4/11 at 28 °C (Fig. 4 B and C).
Since the above aca4/11 phenotypes were suppressed at 28 °C,
we sought to determine if elevated temperature could also sup-
press the disrupted flg22-dependent Ca2+ responses. Growth at
28 °C caused a reduction in the magnitude of this response in
both Col-0 and aca4/11, with the degree of aca4/11 response at
28 °C now closely mirroring that of Col-0 at this temperature
(Fig. 4E). Interestingly, the FRET:CFP values for aca4/11 were
still significantly higher than Col-0 at both 22 °C and 28 °C and
Col-0 baseline was higher at 28 °C than 22 °C (Fig. 4D and SI
Appendix, Fig. S6). Thus, growth at elevated temperature appeared
to raise the basal Ca2+ level in both Col-0 and aca4/11, but also
dampened the subsequent flg22-induced Ca2+ increase to the same
degree in both backgrounds.
One explanation of these altered response kinetics between
aca4/11 and Col-0 at altered temperatures would be that the
sensitivity of the plants to flg22 had changed through alteration
in FLS2 levels, rather than more directly affecting Ca2+ ho-
meostatic and signaling-related mechanisms. However, we did not
detect any significant differences in FLS2 protein or FLS2 tran-
script levels between genotypes or temperature treatments, sug-
gesting that the differences in flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling is
independent of FLS2 receptor levels and likely reflects temperature-
related events downstream of receptor activation (SI Appendix,
Fig. S7).

aca4/11-Associated
Phenotypes. It is known that the aca4/11 lesioning phenotype is
rescued by expression of either ACA4 or ACA11 in this mutant
background (14). Such data provide a clear link between lesioning
behavior and these two tonoplast ACAs. The rescue likely works
as the native pumps, with all of their regulatory systems, are being
reintroduced into the membrane in which they normally operate.
Indeed, the ACAs form a multigene family with clades that map to
particular organellar membranes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), and thus
it seems likely that particular family members are tailored to
operate within the lipid milieu and regulatory networks associated
with a particular membrane environment. We asked if this idea
was true by targeting a nontonoplast ACA to the tonoplast of the
aca4/11 double knockout and assessing its ability to rescue the
double-knockout phenotypes.
We chose to relocalize ACA8, a plasma membrane pump, to
the tonoplast due to its significant divergence from ACA4 and
ACA11 in its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. This is the region
where much of this family of pump’s regulation has been localized
(30–33) and where a large amount of its isoform-dependent amino
acid sequence diversity resides (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). In order to
relocalize ACA8, we deleted its C-terminal tail and replaced it
with the analogous region of ACA11 (thus creating the chimeric
ACA8-11C). The C terminus of ACA11 contains two sequences
indicative of tonoplast localization, a dileucine (DXXXLL) and a
tyrosine (YXXΦ) motif, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a
bulky hydrophobic amino acid (SI Appendix, Fig. S9) (29, 34).
Furthermore, we created a version of the ACA8-11C chimeric
pump with a point mutation in the P-loop of the core pump region
(ACA8-D482A) that converted a conserved aspartate known to be
important for pump activity into an alanine, effectively inactivating
the pump (35). For both ACA8-11C and its D482A variant we
generated versions tagged at the C terminus with mGFP5 (for
localization studies). We also made ACA8-11C with a FLAG tag

that we used in Ca2+ imaging experiments as the mGFP5 tag in-
terferes with the imaging of the CFP/YFP-based YC-Nano65 Ca2+
sensor probe we have used. All pump variants were driven by the
constitutive AtUBQ10 promoter.
Fig. 5 shows that both ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A-
mGFP5 colocalized with the dye LysoTrackerRed DND-99, known
to label the acidic vacuolar lumen and highlight the tonoplast
membrane (36–39). We confirmed that DND-99 is a robust to-
noplast marker in pavement cells by showing it colocalizes with the
tonoplast-localized protein γ-TIP-CFP (40) (Fig. 5). Further
analyses throughout the plant indicated that neither ACA8-11C-
mGFP5, D482A-mGFP5, nor γ-TIP-CFP colocalized with the
plasma membrane marker FM5-95 in, for example, cells of the
root differentiation and elongation zone, leaf guard cells, or in
shoot-derived protoplasts, suggesting that ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and
D482A-mGFP5 were relocalized from the plasma membrane to
the tonoplast (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Although such
relocalization is likely being driven by the C-terminal di-leucine
and tyrosine motifs we had engineered onto this protein, we
cannot discount that overexpression alone is driving mistargeting
of the chimeric pump. Irrespective of precise retargeting mecha-
nism, our results indicate tonoplast localization of the ACA8-11C
and D482A-mGFP5.
ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5, was able to
rescue the growth and lesion phenotype of aca4/11 (Fig. 6A and
SI Appendix, Fig. S11), suggesting that ACA8 must retain func-
tional pump capacity to rescue the double-knockout phenotype.
Importantly, overexpression of ACA8 at its native location at the
plasma membrane did not rescue these phenotypes in the aca4/
11 background, indicating that Ca2+ efflux activity specifically at
the tonoplast is required for rescue (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). In
parallel experiments, UBQ10::ACA8-11C-FLAG was transformed
into aca4/11 plants expressing YC-Nano65, revealing that basal
Ca2+ levels and flg22-dependent Ca2+ signals were similar to Col-
0 and significantly lower than the aca4/11 mutant (Fig. 6C, SI
Appendix, Fig. S6, and Movie S5), These results indicated that the
relocalized pump had also rescued the Ca2+ phenotype of aca4/11.
Interestingly, following the flg22 Ca2+ response over time scales
that captured recovery from the initial flg22-induced peak in
[Ca2+]cyt indicated that both Col-0 and aca4/11 could restore basal
Ca2+ levels at similar time points despite aca4/11 showing an el-
evated peak Ca2+ amplitude after flg22 treatment (Fig. 6C).
Furthermore, expression of ACA8-11C-FLAG in the aca4/11
background restored longer-term recovery kinetics to resemble
wild-type. Although there was an apparent trend for setting even
lower Ca2+ levels than in wild-type over this recovery period in
these ACA8-11C-FLAG lines, this change was not statistically
significant.
We also found that the flg22-induction of defense transcripts
that we previously noted as not being altered in the aca4/11
background (FRK1, PHI1, and ICS1) (Fig. 6B) was unaffected by
expressing either ACA8-11C or D482A in the aca4/11 back-
ground (although PHI1 did show a small reduction in levels of
induction from ∼12- to ∼10-fold when D482A was expressed,
and FRK1 increased from ∼10- to ∼13-fold). However, induc-
tion of CPB60g and Pst resistance, features that we have previ-
ously seen to be altered in aca4/11 (Fig. 6 B and D), were rescued
to wild-type–like levels by expressing ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but
not D482A-mGFP5 (Fig. 6 B and D). Again, the effects on the
defense phenotype of aca4/11 was most evident in the earlier
stages of invasion at 1 DPI (Fig. 6D).
Discussion
Ca2+-based signaling has been closely linked to PTI, with elicitors
such as flg22 triggering Ca2+ changes (e.g., refs. 23, 39) that are
thought to play prominent roles in downstream signaling events (1,
4–6). In this study we showed that tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps
appear to not only be modulators of Ca2+ homeostasis, but play
an important role in regulating both response to the PAMP flg22
and in the induction of PTI. Plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps have
likewise been linked to PAMP signaling, with for example, ACA8
thought to form a complex with the FLS2 receptor (15). However,
knocking out these plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux pumps that
would be thought to play roles in limiting and eventually resetting
increases in Ca2+ signals, has been reported to actually attenuate
PAMP-triggered Ca2+ responses and downstream signaling (15).
In addition, although aca8/10 plants show elevated baseline Ca2+,
they do not display spontaneous lesion formation (15). Taken
together, these observations suggest a potentially complex role for
the plasma membrane pumps in signal processing outside of their
ability to pump out, and so normally limit, PAMP-induced cyto-
plasmic Ca2+ signals. In contrast, we found that knockouts in the
vacuolar ACAs led to elevated baseline Ca2+ within the cell
(Fig. 1), a larger flg22-induced Ca2+ increase (Figs. 2 and 3), and
elevated levels of downstream PTI responses (Fig. 4B). These
observations are all consistent with these tonoplast pumps con-
tributing to maintenance of low basal Ca2+ levels and playing roles
in limiting the magnitude of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals, signals that
are themselves important mediators of PTI signaling.
A Role for Temperature in Regulating Early PTI Responses. Elevated
temperature is known to attenuate defense signaling (27) and as
the aca4/11 plants show phenotypes pointing at runaway PTI
events (lesion mimicry, elevated defense responses, increased
Ca2+ signaling to flg22), we used this treatment to ask if the high-
temperature effect suppressed both Ca2+ dynamics and other
defense-response phenotypes. Indeed, elevated temperature at-
tenuated the PTI-related Ca2+ dynamics in aca4/11 to wild-
type–like characteristics and these changes correlated with res-
cue of other elevated defense responses, such as defense gene
induction and pathogen resistance (Fig. 4 B and C). These higher
temperatures affected the attenuation of flg22-dependent Ca2+
signals in both Col-0 and aca4/11 plants (Fig. 4E), suggesting that
common temperature-dependent components of the Ca2+ efflux
machinery are affected in both genotypes. Although previous
studies have indicated that PTI responses, including positive reg-
ulation of defense transcripts and MAPK activation, are favored at
elevated temperatures (41), our experiments indicate that Ca2+
signaling, a canonic PTI response, is suppressed at elevated tem-
perature, consistent with reports that defense-response systems
are compromised at higher temperatures, likely through alter-
ations in salicylic acid-dependent pathways (29).
Transporters at the Tonoplast Shape the Calcium Signature. Along
with previous work on aca4/11 defense and lesion phenotypes
(14), our study indicates that the activity of ACAs at the tono-
plast is important for PTI and normal PAMP-dependent Ca2+
signaling. Using a combination of modeling and direct Ca2+
measurements using aequorin-expressing plants, Lenzoni et al.
(42) have shown that not only the characteristics of the rising, but
also the falling phase of Ca2+ transients are likely to be impor-
tant for modulating subsequent defense-related gene expression.
However, in our experiments, although aca4/11 had a significantly
elevated Ca2+ signal in response to flg22 (Figs. 2B and 3 B and C),
both Col-0 and aca4/11 reached basal Ca2+ levels at similar time
points (Fig. 6C). This observation indicates that ACA4 and
ACA11 are likely important for regulating the net influx of Ca2+
during flg22 perception (i.e., the initial rising phase of the signal),
while other efflux systems may be involved in the re-establishment
of baseline Ca2+. The Ca2+/H+ exchangers of the tonoplast have
similarly been shown to operate in PTI, although the complex they
form may act as a response element downstream of the ini-
tial perception and signaling machinery (43). The Ca2+/H+ ex-
changers are also known to play roles in abiotic stress responses
(44) and indeed, previous work has implied that the tonoplast
provides a signaling hub for these classes of response. For

example, in the moss Physcomitrella patens, knockout of the to-
noplast calcium pump PCA1 resulted in NaCl-dependent Ca2+
transients that were higher in amplitude and of longer duration
(45). Thus, it will be of interest to assess whether ACA4 and
ACA11 also play roles in abiotic stress-related Ca2+ signaling.
We also show that relocalization of a plasma membrane Ca2+
pump, ACA8, to the tonoplast rescued the phenotypes associ-
ated with the aca4/11 tonoplast pump knockout. Several studies
have indicated that dileucine motifs are involved in the locali-
zation of tonoplast membrane proteins (46–48), and so we have
capitalized on this machinery to retarget nontonoplast proteins
to the tonoplast for functional rescue experiments. Thus, al-
though when we overexpressed native ACA8, it targeted to the
plasma membrane (SI Appendix, Fig. S12), expression of this
same pump engineered with the C terminus of ACA11 was tar-
geted to the tonoplast, with little indication of a plasma mem-
brane localized fraction (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10).
Relocalization of ACA8 to the tonoplast sometimes led to the
formation of “bulb” structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), which are
believed to be artifacts due to the dimerization of GFP (49).
However, as we used mGFP5—a monomeric form of GFP—that
should not dimerize, whether these bulbs are bona fide tonoplast
structures (50) potentially enriched in ACA8-11C will require
future study.
ACAs are typified by the presence of a calmodulin-binding
N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that restricts pump activity
(35, 51–53) and accounts for much of the variability between
ACA isoforms (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). The autoinhibitory domain
can undergo posttranslational modifications that can potentially
modulate the binding capacity of calmodulin or calmodulin-like
(CML) proteins. For example, the autoinhibitory domain of
ACA8 appears to be regulated by CML36 (32). This region can
also be phosphorylated (30, 31), but in general the molecular
identities of the modifiers of ACA action remain undefined.
Despite the differences between the N-terminal domains of ACA4,
ACA11, and ACA8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), ACA8-11C was still
able to functionally rescue the aca4/11 mutant phenotypes. This
observation suggests that Ca2+ transport across the tonoplast by
an ACA is the critical feature for this signaling system but, at the
same time, that it may not require regulatory circuits specifically
tailored to Ca2+ pumps normally targeted to this location. The
failure of the pump-dead D482A mutant of ACA8-11C to rescue
the aca4/11 phenotype reinforces the idea of this essential role for
pumping activity. Thus, the proliferation of ACA family pumps
through evolutionary time may have been necessitated to specify
the localization of pumps to relevant membranes with a diver-
gence event segregating ACAs into plasma membrane and non-
plasma membrane localizations. Although specific regulatory events
associated with each membrane locale may have evolved, the basic
core pumping activity of these transporters appears robust enough
to work in varied cellular locations. Similarly, the Ca2+ homeo-
static system appears flexible enough to integrate heterologous
pumping activity into a system capable of supporting normal
Ca2+-based signaling activities. Thus, the Ca2+ signaling system of
pumps and channels shows the features of resilience and com-
pensation reminiscent of the scale-free genetic networks that
characterize many other cellular regulatory systems (54).

(Chlorox) and 3 mL of 37% (vol/vol) hydrochloric acid for 3 h. Seeds for confocal
imaging were plated on gels of 1/2 Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) basal medium
(PhytoTechnology Laboratories) containing 10 mM sucrose and 0.5% (wt/vol)
Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.7, poured to a 2-mm thickness onto 40 × 24-mm
coverslips (Goldseal, ThermoFisher), then stratified at 4 °C for 48 h before being
placed in a growth chamber (16-h light/8-h dark at 22 °C or 28 °C). Multiple
independently transformed lines expressing 35S::YC-Nano65, UBQ10::ACA8-GFP,
UBQ10::ACA8-11Cterm-mGFP5, UBQ10::ACA8-11Cterm-FLAG, UBQ10::ACA8-
D482A-11Cterm-mGFP5, or UBQ10::ACA8-D482A-11Cterm-FLAG were obtained
using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, as previously described (55).
Plants imaged for rosette area were germinated in growth chambers set at
22 °C or 28 °C, 16-h light/8-h dark, then transplanted to soil (Propagation Mix,
SunGro Horticulture) 7 to 10 d after germination and watered with deionized
water. Images were obtained once a day and rosette areas were calculated
using FIJI (56).
Membrane Staining. Three- to 5-d-old seedlings were incubated in 1/2 LS
liquid media containing 1 μM FM5-95 (ThermoFisher) for 5 min on ice.
Seedlings were similarly stained with 2 μM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Ther-
moFisher) but were incubated for 30 min in 1/2 LS liquid media containing
dye, then washed in 1/2 LS media without dye for 3 h at room temperature
prior to imaging. Images were acquired on an LSM 780 inverted confocal
microscope (Zeiss) using a 40× Water, NA 0.9 objective. GFP and FM5-95
were excited with 488-nm laser, using a 488 dichroic mirror and emission at
500 to 550 nm for GFP or 600 to 700 nm for FM5-95. Lysotracker Red DND-99
was excited with a 561-nm laser (488/561 dichroic; emission 600 to 650 nm).
Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients for colocalization were
calculated using the PSC Colocalization Plugin in FIJI (57).
Ratiometric Ca2+ Imaging. Cotyledons were detached from seedlings grown
under sterile conditions on plates, as described above, for 7 to 10 d or for
rosette leaves from soil grown plants, 20 d after germination. Detached
leaves were placed between a thin layer of 1/2 LS + 10 mM sucrose, 0.5% (wt/
vol) Phytagel and a coverslip, adaxial side down, 2 h prior to imaging. A
1-cm × 1-cm well was cut into the gel prior to imaging for the application of
solutions. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal
microscope with a 5×/0.16 M27 EC Plan-Neofluar or 20×/0.75 Plan-
Apochromat objective. Excitation of the YC-Nano65 sensor was performed
with the 458-nm laser line and emission for cpVenus and CFP were obtained
at 525 to 540 nm and 460 to 505 nm, respectively. Whole-leaf imaging was
performed as in Lenglet, et al. (58). Briefly, a Nikon stereomicroscope (SMZ-
25) equipped with a 1× objective (P2-SHR PLAN APO, Nikon), W-VIEW
image-splitting optics (Hamamatsu), and a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu)
were used to image 20-d-old rosette leaves of YC-Nano65 expressing plants
every 30 s. The cpVenus signal arises from FRET from its CFP partner. As Ca2+
levels rise this FRET signal increases and the CFP emission decreases. Time-
series FRET data were normalized via the following equation: ΔR/Ro = (R -
Ro)/Ro, where R is the ratio of cpVenus emission (FRET):CFP emission and Ro is
the average baseline value of this “FRET ratio” prior to flg22 treatment.
FRET ratio data were analyzed using the image calculator tool in FIJI (56)
using a region of interest encompassing the entire leaf or cotyledon.
Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging for whole rosette leaves was performed with a
motorized stereomicroscope equipped with image-splitting optics, as pre-
viously described (58).
qPCR. The total RNA for all samples was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen) and any contaminating genomic DNA was degraded with TURBO
DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was
diluted to 10 ng/μL and first-strand cDNA and qPCR were performed using
Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix (New England Biolabs) in a 20-
μL reaction. qPCR analysis was performed on a 7500 Real Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems) using the UBQ10 (At4G05320) gene from A. thaliana as
an internal reference (29). qPCR was performed in a 96-well optical PCR plate
(ABgene) using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C,and 40
cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 58 °C and 15 s at 65 °C, and 1 cycle of dissociation

from 58 to 95 °C with 1 ° temperature increments. The qPCR primers used in
this study are presented in SI Appendix, Table S1.
ACA8-11Cterm Chimeric Pump Cloning. The AtUBQ10 (636bp upstream ATG)
promoter was amplified from A. thaliana gDNA using primers 532/533 (SI
Appendix, Table S2) that introduced 5′KpnI/3′NcoI sites for subcloning into
pCAMBIA1302.
mGFP5-tagged constructs. A C-terminal truncated version of ACA8 (ACA8ΔC)
was cloned from cDNA using oligos 525/526 (SI Appendix, Table S2) to
generate a 5′XbaI and a 3′ SalI sites for subcloning into UBQ10pro::mGFP5-
pCAMBIA1302. UBQ10::ACA8ΔC_1302 was linearized with SalI and gBlock5
(Integrated DNA Technologies) (SI Appendix, Table S2) was introduced using
isothermal assembly (NEBuilder HiFi Assembly Kit; New England Biolabs) to
produce UBQ10::ACA8-11C-mGFP5-1302. The D482A point mutant was gen-
erated by amplifying ACA8-11C in two halves (D482A_1 and D482A_2) with
primers 633/634 and 635/636, then recombining into UBQ10pro::mGFP5-
pCAMBIA1302 digested with XbaI and SalI via isothermal assembly.
FLAG-tagged construct. ACA8-11C sequence was amplified from UBQ10::ACA8-
11C_1302 with oligos 571/572 (SI Appendix, Table S2) to add a C-terminal
FLAG tag and to produce overlaps for isothermal assembly into UBQ10-
pro::pCAMBIA1300 digested with XbaI/BamHI.
Pathogenesis Assays. Ten-day-old seedlings were flood-inoculated essentially
as in Ishiga et al. (59). Seedlings were grown in 12-well plates containing 1/2
LS salts and 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel solid media. On the day of infection, Pst
DC3000 (pVSP61) inoculum was suspended in sterile water with 0.025% (vol/
vol) Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds) to an OD595nm = 0.01 (∼8.0 × 106 CFU/mL of
bacteria) and 3 mL of inoculum was added to each well for 3 min, decanted,
and tissue harvested from 5 to 10 seedlings per biological replicate at 1 and
3 DPI. After harvesting, tissue fresh weight was measured, and the samples
were surface-sterilized with 5% (vol/vol) H2O2 for 5 min and rinsed three
times with sterile water. Tissue was placed in 1.5-mL microfuge tubes and
macerated in sterile water for 5 min in a 1600 miniG (Spex SamplePrep) set
at 1,000 strokes per minute. Macerated tissue was serially diluted in sterile
water and spread onto LB plates containing 25 μM rifampicin. Colonies per
plate were counted after incubating at 28 °C for 48 h.
Protoplast Isolation. Protoplasts were isolated from 10-d-old seedling shoot
tissue essentially as in Zhai et al. (60). Confocal imaging of protoplasts was
performed with identical settings as described for mGFP5 and FM5-95.
Microsomal
Fraction
Preparation and
Immunoblot
Analysis.
Microsomal
preparations and Western blots were performed as previously described (61).
Briefly, 10-d-old seedlings were homogenized in extraction buffer (250 mM
Sorbitol, 50 mM Hepes-BTP, 25 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM DTT, 6 mM EGTA
1.2% [wt/vol] Polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 and Roche cOmplete protease inhibi-
tor mixture [Sigma-Aldrich], pH 7.4). The homogenate was filtered with
cheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant re-
covered and then centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the mi-
crosomal fraction. Microsomes were resuspended in extraction buffer and
protein concentration measured with BCA Reagent (ThermoFisher) to ensure
equal loading for SDS/PAGE. After transfer of protein to nitrocellulose, blots
were incubated with rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies for anti-H+-PPase
(52) and anti-FLS2 (Agrisera) and then probed with horseradish peroxidase
conjugated secondary antibody and developed via chemiluminescence.
Phylogenetic Analysis. Sequence alignment and tree construction was based
on either the whole protein sequence or N-terminal amino acid domains of
the A. thaliana ACAs with AtECA3 as an outgroup. Neighbor-joining trees
were constructed using Mega6 (62) with 1,000 bootstraps and a Poisson
model.
