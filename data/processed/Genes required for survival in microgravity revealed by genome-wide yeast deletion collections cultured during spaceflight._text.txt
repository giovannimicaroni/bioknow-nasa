Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal
stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic,
unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment
of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection
of ∼4800 homozygous and ∼5900 heterozygous (including ∼1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains,
each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast
deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second
additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a
compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight
have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which
spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.
1. Introduction
Physical effects of microgravity during spaceflight can often
be described by equations that allow their quantification
[1, 2]. For example, microgravity has well-defined effects on
sedimentation in association with reduced terminal velocity
and shear in suspension culture [3] and reduced gravity-
dependent convection of gases [4]. Biological effects of
spaceflight on cells and organisms, on the other hand, are
much harder to define [1, 2]. For example, spaceflight also
entails radiation exposure, which has been studied in diverse
systems but whose effects are not fully understood [5]. What
is needed is a robust, unbiased, quantifiable system that is
relevant for translation to ground-based applications and
that is able to clearly distinguish spaceflight effects. It is
our premise that yeast deletion collections are ideally suited

for this type of analysis as yeast can be precisely controlled
genetically and readily grown under spaceflight conditions.
Biological responses of yeast strains during spaceflight can
be quantified and compared to well-established databases
of ground-based stressors and the comparisons can reveal
features that are unique to microgravity as well as features
that are shared with ground-based perturbations. While yeast
cannot completely reflect the complexities of mammalian
cells organized into tissues, the high degree of homology
shared with human (∼70% of all essential yeast genes have
a significant human homolog) provides hypotheses for the
mechanism of many responses of interest [6, 7].
Previous studies have attempted to identify, isolate, and
offset the various physical factors changing during spaceflight
to demonstrate their effects in an iterative fashion [8–10].
Earlier studies on the effects of space radiation on yeast failed
to find any change in point mutation rates, DNA replication
and/or repair, heritable damage, or colony morphology [5,
8, 11, 12]. However, those studies were limited by assay
sensitivity. Here we applied the yeast deletion collection as
a biological reporter to understand the metabolic pathways
affecting survival during culture in spaceflight. In this fash-
ion, we are able to make genome-wide comparisons and test
for concordance against an extensive library of more than
3200 physical and pharmacological stressors [13].
Yeast is the first, and to date only, organism for which
a complete, genome-wide knockdown collection is available.
This collection is comprised of a genome-wide set of strains
where each strain carries a precise deletion of a single gene
[14]. Assembled over a four-year period by a consortium of
35 laboratories, this collection has been used by hundreds
of laboratories to test thousands of different environmental
stressors to define the genes required for survival in those
conditions (see [15] for review). The molecular barcodes
present in each strain allow the yeast deletion collection to
be grown as a pool in the presence or absence of the stressor
of interest after which the relative abundance of each strain
is subsequently quantified [16]. Strains carrying a deletion of
a gene required for survival in the presence of the stressor
grow more slowly and thus exhibit a fitness defect reflected
by their reduced abundance at the end of the culture period.
In this manner, all genes required for growth can be readily
identified in a single experiment, revealing the genes and
associated pathways affected by the stressor.
To identify the metabolic and genomic pathways affected
by spaceflight, the homozygous and heterozygous yeast
deletion collections were grown in spaceflight and ground
control conditions, with and without hyperosmolar sodium
chloride, providing a second stressor. In spaceflight alone,
the homozygous deletion collection revealed the importance
of processes linked to mitochondria, while the heterozygous
collection highlighted genes involved in regulating transla-
tion and ribosomal RNA transport. Both homozygous and
heterozygous collections highlighted DNA repair. With the
addition of NaCl, the homozygous collection also revealed
the importance of RNA-related processes including ribosome
assembly and biogenesis and mRNA processing and decay, as
well as modification of tRNAs. Moreover, the NaCl addition
highlighted replication processes more clearly (compared to
the homozygous collection without NaCl), suggesting that
spaceflight has measurable effects on these core and evolu-
tionarily conserved processes. With the heterozygous collec-
tion, the addition of NaCl led to the identification of a nuclear
pore organization gene, potentially providing additional
insight into how RNA transport is affected by spaceflight.
Taken together, the deletion collections identified several
biological processes associated with spaceflight, and the addi-
tional hyperosmolar stress emphasized the importance of
related processes.
In a follow-up analysis, we queried the effects of space-
flight against a database of drug effects on yeast to search for
those that are most concordant, thereby suggesting similar
mechanisms of perturbation. Not only do the effects of
spaceflight have relatively high concordance with the effects
of DNA-damaging agents, but also there is tight agreement
amongst multiple therapeutic agents in this drug class,
providing additional support for these findings.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1.
Overall
Design. The
Opticell
Processing
Module,
described below, was used to perform a series of ∼21 genera-
tion pooled growth experiments on two yeast deletion
collections: (i) ∼4800 homozygous strains and (ii) ∼5900
heterozygous strains (including ∼1100 single-copy deletions
of essential genes), each carrying unique DNA barcodes that
act as strain identifiers. Experiments were performed in both
rich media and rich media supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl
to assess the additional effect of osmotic stress on survival.
The samples flew sortie on space shuttle mission STS-135
to the International Space Station (ISS). Parallel control
experiments were performed in static 1G terrestrial controls
in the Orbital Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space
Center to match temperature, humidity, air composition,
and volatile organic compounds. Ground controls were
conducted in a 24-hour asynchronous fashion to allow
matching of the experimental timelines on ISS as relayed
through air-to-ground communication by the flight crew. At
the end of the growth period, the fitness of each strain in each
experimental pool was assessed as described [17]. Briefly,
genomic DNA was extracted from each sample, the barcodes
in each pool were amplified by PCR, and the abundance of
each barcode was quantified by next generation sequencing.
A barcode count reflects the abundance of the corresponding
strain at the end of the experiment, that is, a quantification of
the relative requirement of the deleted gene for growth in the
tested condition. In total, the experiment results in a count
for each gene resulting in a gene list rank ordered by their
importance for growth in the tested condition.
2.2. Yeast Deletion Pool Construction. The yeast deletion col-
lections were stored as individual strains in YPD containing
7% DMSO at −80∘C, in 96-well plates. The plates were
thawed, mixed, and robotically pinned onto YPD agar plates
as an array of 384 strains. After two days of growth at 30∘C,
colonies were consolidated (four plates of 384 to one plate
of 1536 colonies) and robotically pinned in triplicate. Cells
were grown in 30∘C for 2-3 days until colonies formed. Slow

growing strains were grown separately for 2-3 additional days.
All plates were then flooded with 5–7 mL of media, scraped
and pooled in YPD + 7% DMSO to a final concentration of
OD600 = 0.84, and frozen at −80∘C until use, as described [17].
2.3. Construction of Opticell Culture System and Spaceflight
Experiment. In this study, we designed the Opticell Pro-
cessing Module or OPM (Figure 1) that was capable of
maintaining the yeast deletion collection as a pool grown
in liquid culture for at least 20 generations in microgravity.
The hardware comprised a liquid-sealed system of growth
chambers (Opticells) that allowed for gas exchange across
polystyrene membranes. Each OPM consisted of three Nunc
Opticells held together with a common manifold and valve
system that is autoclaved and attached with watertight O-
ring seals. A 3 mL syringe connected to the manifold with
a Luer fitting is used to transfer liquid between chambers
and mix without breaking sterility and with minimal operator
intervention. The valve on the manifold has four settings that
connect the syringe to the following port locations 1: Off
position, 2: Opticell A, 3: Opticell B, or 4: Opticell C. The
OPM allows propagation of each deletion collection for a
combined ∼21 generations of growth when three chambers
are used and the inoculum and transfer volumes are 0.5 mL.
To perform a growth assay in the OPM, each of the
three chambers was prefilled with 7 mL of sterile growth
media. Deletion collection aliquots were preloaded into
each syringe and shipped to Kennedy Space Center, frozen
in media containing 7% DMSO (v/v) as a cryoprotectant.
During final integration at Kennedy Space Center, the OPMs
were prechilled to 4∘C. Each deletion collection aliquot
was thawed, attached to an OPM manifold, injected, and
mixed into chamber A. Cultures were maintained at 4∘C and
flown to the International Space Station (ISS). The growth
experiment was initiated on orbit by warming the OPMs to
30∘C. After 16–24 h at 30∘C, a 0.5 mL sample was removed
from chamber A using the same syringe and inoculated into
chamber B. The process was repeated 16–24 hours later to
inoculate 0.5 mL of sample from chamber B into chamber
C. After an additional 16–24 hours, the OPMs were cooled
back down to 4∘C to greatly reduce any further growth
and preserve the samples for return to Earth and postflight
analysis. Exponential yeast growth leads to early depletion
of growth media nutrients and significant retardation of
further growth well before 16–24 hours. Growth is limited
by media volume and strain distribution within the yeast
deletion library reaches a steady state within that Opticell.
2.4. Next Generation Sequencing. The flight samples that
returned from the ISS were handled in parallel with the
ground control set. The OPM was disassembled into its three
Opticells, and the entire contents were transferred to a storage
tube using a blunt needle connected to a 20 mL syringe. One
mL of each sample (at a final OD600 of 1.0-2.0) was pro-
cessed to extract genomic DNA. Purified deletion pool DNA
was amplified in two separate PCR reactions as described
[17] and the amplicons purified prior to sequencing on an
Illumina HiSeq2000. Each purified amplicon library was
sequenced to a minimum depth of 500 counts/strain/sample

Figure 1: The Opticell Processing Module (OPM) designed for
propagation of each deletion collection for ∼21 generations of
growth. The OPM comprises three commercially available optically
clear chambers (Opticells, Nunc) that are joined by a manifold and
scaffold that can be autoclaved and assembled rapidly. The manifold
contains a multiway valve unit which mates to each Opticell or to
an the off position using O-ring seals. The opposite side of the valve
contains a Luer fitting into which a standard 3cc syringe is attached.
To perform a growth assay in the OPM, each of the three chambers is
filled with 7 mL of sterile growth media. Deletion pools are loaded
into the inoculation syringe and then injected into Chamber A of
the OPM, precooled to 4∘C. Growth is initiated by warming the
unit to 30∘C. After 16–24 h, 0.5 mL is removed from Chamber A and
injected and mixed into Chamber B using the same syringe. This is
repeated to continue multigenerational growth in Chamber C.
as described [18]. Duplicate experiments were performed for
all conditions, to ensure that at least one complete time course
was collected for each pool (heterozygote and homozygote)
and each condition. Due to failures in sample processing,
several time points were not recovered or did not meet
our in-house quality metrics (e.g., if sequence counts/strain
were below threshold values). Accordingly, we focused on
evaluating each experimental condition using singleton data
as described in Table 1.
2.5. Data Analysis. All computational analyses were per-
formed using 𝑅[19] unless otherwise indicated.
2.5.1. Normalization of Sequence Counts. Sequence counts
for each strain in each experiment were quantified and nor-
malized according to [18]. Briefly, each 20-mer barcode was
amplified with primers comprised of the common barcode
primers in addition to the sequences required for cluster
formation on the Illumina flow cell. For multiplexed Illumina
sequencing, 5-mer tag sequences were incorporated into each
primer between the Illumina and barcode primer sequences.
This multiplexing tag allowed postsequencing assignment of
each amplicon to a particular experiment. Results for the
7-generation time point of the heterozygous deletion pool
grown in spaceflight without NaCl did not pass our quality

control and, consequently, that time point was omitted from
analyses of the heterozygous pool without NaCl. All other
counts were mean-normalized between experiments such
that each experiment had the same mean count. We added
ten pseudocounts to all sequence tag tallies (and, thus, all
subsequent gene tallies) to prevent division by zero during
data analyses (see Table S1 and Table S2 for mean normalized
counts in Supplementary Materials available online at http://
dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/976458).
2.5.2. Barcode Selection for Each Strain. For each strain, we
used signal from only the upstream or the downstream
barcode (relative to the deletion site). First, we assumed that
barcode counts close to zero represent background noise (e.g.,
possibly due to incorrect mapping of reads to barcodes). We
thus selected a background threshold (bgThreshold = 100;
see Parameter Selection), assuming that counts below it do
not accurately reflect strain abundance. Then, for each time
course, we filtered out barcodes where the average (normal-
ized) count for the first 14 generations (the earliest time point
with usable data in all experiments) was below bgThreshold.
This filtering removed all barcodes for ∼650–3200 strains
(depending on the time course), and these strains were
omitted from subsequent analyses; see Supplementary Tables
S3 (homozygous strains) and S4 (heterozygous strains).
For time courses that only had two time points (and
thus an inefficient number to compute fits), strains that
still had two barcodes after filtering were represented by
their upstream barcodes due to their overall better behavior
observed in a previous study [20]. For other time courses,
linear fits (with and without the time logged) were computed
for each remaining barcode. We defined the best fit as the fit
with the lowest residual sum of squares (RSS) and used the
𝐹-test to compute a 𝑃value estimating the significance with
which the fitted model is better than the null model (of a flat
line at the average count value). The Benjamini and Hochberg
method was used to correct the 𝑃for multiple comparisons
and generate FDR values [21]. Strains with two remaining
barcodes were represented by the barcode with the higher 𝑅2
(a measure of the amount of variation in the data explained by
the fitted model), because they manifest less noise and better
fit the data.
2.5.3.
Parameter
Selection. The
selected
normalization
method (tested mean and quartile normalization) and
bgThreshold (tested 50, 100, and 150) is the combination that
resulted in the most significant enrichment of slow growing
strains identified in the heterozygous deletion pool, sampled
every two generations for 20 generations (data not shown),
with slow growers identified in a previous study [22]. Briefly,
we defined slow growers as those exhibiting sizable decreases
in abundance over time. The significance of the decrease was
estimated with FDR values (see Barcode Selection for Each
Strain), and the magnitude was estimated with ΔAUC =
(⟨area under the growth curve⟩−⟨area under the flat growth
curve⟩)/(𝑡max −𝑡0), where the flat growth curve is fixed at the
𝑡0 abundance level, and the area under a curve is estimated
using the trapezoid method. Also, if at some time point the
abundance of a strain is less than or equal to bgThreshold and
remains at negligible levels for the rest of the time course, we
identified the strain as slow growing.
2.5.4. Identification of Significant Fitness Defects in Time
Point Comparisons. To identify strains that exhibited sig-
nificant fitness defects at a later time point (14 or 21 gen-
erations) compared to the first time point (7 generations),
normalized counts less than bgThreshold were first forced
to equal bgThreshold. Then, for each strain, we comput-
ed log2ratio = log2(abundance7G/abundance14G/21G) where
abundanceyG is the count of the strain at 𝑦generations.
For a given time point, robust 𝑍scores were computed
from the set of log2ratios; for example, 𝑍𝑖= (log2ratio𝑖−
⟨log2ratio median⟩)/⟨log2ratio MAD⟩for strain 𝑖. Each 𝑍𝑖
was then used to obtain 𝑃𝑖from the standard normal
distribution, and we assume that strains with low 𝑃values
are outliers in the distribution of log2ratios. Moreover, strains
with counts above bgThreshold at the first time point and
counts equivalent to bgThreshold at the later time point of
interest are defined as having dropped out. Taken together,
we define strains with significant fitness defects at a specific
time point as strains with log2ratio ≥1 and 𝑃≤0.001 and/or
strains that dropped out (Table S5, Table S6).
2.5.5. Spaceflight versus Ground Comparisons. For compar-
isons involving specific time points, we identified the set of
strains that exhibited significant fitness defects (relative to
the first time point) in the flight condition but not in the
ground condition. This set is then further restricted to the set
of strains with useable data in both conditions.
2.5.6. Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis. We obtained
gene ontology (GO) annotations of yeast genes from the
Saccharomyces Genome Database (downloaded on May 26,
2012). GO biological processes that were too specific (con-
taining less than five genes) or too general (containing greater
than 300 genes) were excluded from the analysis.
Given a query set of genes (e.g., genes deleted from a set
of (flight-ground) strains), we used the hypergeometric test to
obtain a 𝑃value estimating the significance with which the set
is enriched with genes annotated to a given biological process,
relative to a gene universe defined as the set of genes with
usable data for both flight and ground conditions. Due to a

limited number of significantly enriched processes following
correction for multiple comparisons (FDR ≤0.1), here we
report significantly enriched processes prior to the correction
(𝑃≤0.01).
We visualized GO enrichment results with enrichment
maps shown in Figures 2 and 3 that were generated using an
approach similar to the Enrichment Map Cytoscape Plugin
v1.1 [23, 24]. In contrast to the plugin, the nodes in each
map were clustered with MCL (inflation = 2), using the
overlap coefficient computed by the plugin as the similarity
metric (coefficients less than 0.5 were set to zero). Nodes in
the same cluster were assigned the same node color, and a
cluster label was determined based on common themes in
the processes within the cluster. Moreover, the size of a node
was made to be proportional to the significance with which
the corresponding process is enriched [−log10(𝑃)]. Each bar
plot summarizes the genes that contribute the most to the
enrichment of processes with the same node color as the plot
border. Specifically, a plot shows the flight-associated genes
that are annotated to the largest number of relevant processes
(if more than 10 genes, only the top 10 are shown). For each
gene, the bar length is proportional to a fitness defect measure
(i.e., log2ratio).
The enrichment maps also combine two sets of enrich-
ment results, with the processes enriched in one set shown
with circle nodes, the processes enriched in the second set
shown with square nodes, and the processes enriched in both
sets shown with diamond nodes.
2.5.7. Similarity between Flight-Associated Genes and Com-
pound-Associated Genes. We previously treated pools of
yeast deletion strains with ∼3200 compounds separately
[13]. Each compound was subsequently associated with a
set of genes deleted from strains that exhibited significant
fitness defects induced by the compound. Like sets of flight-
associated genes in this study, sets of compound-associated
genes were assessed for enrichment of genes annotated to
specific biological processes (as described above), resulting
in an “enrichment profile” for each condition of interest. In
each profile, each process is associated with a 𝑃measuring
the significance of enrichment. Similarity between a pair
of enrichment profiles was computed by concordance of
−log10(𝑃) across all processes common to both profiles,
where concordance is like Pearson correlation except that
scale is not ignored. Compounds with enrichment profiles
that are most similar to a given flight enrichment profile may
induce cellular responses that are most similar to the response
induced by flight.
3. Results and Discussion
Because we cannot distinguish the individual parameters that
include flight, lack of gravity, and increased radiation, for the
purposes of this paper, these are referred to collectively as
“spaceflight” throughout the text. To measure the effects of
spaceflight on the rate of yeast growth in the Opticell, we
inoculated 0.5 mL of a yeast deletion pool into 7 mL of YPD,
resulting in a starting OD600 of ∼0.06/mL and incubated at
30∘C. Following growth for ∼24 hr (∼7 generations), 0.5 mL of
the saturated culture was inoculated into the second chamber.
This process was repeated for the final growth phase in the
third chamber. Population doubling time was ∼100 min in
microgravity compared to ∼90 min in ground-based controls.
Each sample was grown for seven generations/Opticell for a
total of 21 generations (Table 1). Doubling times were back-
calculated using the OD600 of the samples collected at each
time point.
The morphology of Opticell-grown yeast in spaceflight
was indistinguishable from static controls when observed
by light microscopy; for example, budding pattern, overall
shape, and size were not detectably different in the two
conditions. On scanning electron microscopy, there were
budding polarity and ruffling changes in every field, but there
were no consistent differences (data not shown).
We assessed the yeast deletion collection samples for
patterns of strain sensitivity in the following manner: barcode
counts for each strain in each sample were measured and
normalized as described in Methods. The counts were used to
rank each strain in each sample in order of their importance
for growth. Four different samples were available from both
spaceflight and ground cultures: (1) homozygous deletion col-
lection in YPD, (2) homozygous deletion collection in YPD
plus 0.5 M NaCl, (3) heterozygous deletion collection in YPD,
and (4) heterozygous deletion collection in YPD plus 0.5 M
NaCl. Each culture was sampled at three different time points,
7 generations, 14 generations, and 21 generations, and shown
in Table 1. Samples from ground controls were compared to
the corresponding samples grown in microgravity on the ISS.
We analyzed changes in strain abundance by comparing
each time point to a later time point. Using this approach
allowed us to capture those strains that became depleted in
any seven-generation interval. Strains with sizable decreases
in measured abundance or with abundances that drop to
background levels (and remain there) were identified as
exhibiting fitness defects (FDs). Moreover, strains with flight-
specific FDs were identified by subtracting the strains with
FDs in the ground condition.
For the purposes of our gene ontology (GO; http://amigo
.geneontology.org) enrichment analysis, we considered the
homozygous and heterozygous data separately. Based on a
wealth of published data [14, 15], the homozygous, nonessen-
tial deletion collection tends to reveal a similar set of genes
involved in pathways required for resistance to/survival in
multiple environmental conditions, whereas the heterozy-
gous collection of all strains tends to be more specific,
identifying essential proteins uniquely required for growth in
a specific condition [13].
For the homozygous deletion collection, strains that
were depleted from the pool specifically in spaceflight con-
ditions are significantly enriched for genes in biological
processes related to different aspects of RNA metabolism
and catabolism, including ribosome biogenesis, regulation
of ribosomal protein transcription, cytoplasmic RNA trans-
lation, rRNA processing, tRNA modification, and mRNA
decay (Table 2, Figure 2, and Table S5). We also found that
processes related to DNA integrity were required for survival
in spaceflight. In particular, the linked processes of DNA
repair and DNA recombination and replication as well as

Figure 2: Biological processes enriched amongst genes associated with flight-specific fitness defects at different time points in the homozygous
deletion series. Each node represents a significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process (hypergeometric test 𝑃≤0.01). A circle
node indicates enrichment at 14 generations compared to 7 generations (the first time point), a square node indicates enrichment at 21
generations compared to 7 generations, and a diamond node indicates enrichment at both 14 generations and 21 generations (see Methods).
Node size is proportional to the significance of enrichment [−log10(𝑃)]. Node color indicates processes that share genes (see Methods) and
summary labels are shown for nodes of the same color. Edges indicate ≥50% gene overlap between connected processes; width is proportional
to the degree of overlap. Each bar plot provides fitness defect (FD) scores for genes that contribute to the enrichment of processes with the same
node color as the plot border. Specifically, the length of a bar is proportional to the log2(abundance7G/abundance14G/21G), where abundanceyG
represents the abundance of the corresponding gene deletion strain at 𝑦generations (see Methods). An “𝑥” on the bar indicates that the
abundance of the strain lowers to background level at later time point.
chromatin remodeling were all required for resistance to the
effects of spaceflight. Finally, these DNA repair requirements
extend to the mitochondria, which, by virtue of its small
genome, is hypersensitive to DNA damage. Consistent with
this, we found that genes required for both mitochondrial
maintenance and proper protein localization to the mito-
chondria were enriched in the homozygous samples.
The enrichment of these particular processes is consistent
with a general induction of DNA damage, which, in turn,
perturbs RNA biogenesis [25]. Interestingly we have previ-
ously observed this phenomenon with a class of therapeutics
that act as nucleotide analogs, such as 5-fluorouridine and
fluorocytosine (described in detail below). Additionally, it is
particularly noteworthy that, although we do see evidence
of a requirement for RNA and DNA processing genes
in spaceflight alone, the requirement is exacerbated when
spaceflight is combined with the additional hyperosmotic
stress imposed by the addition of 0.5 M NaCl (Table S6).

We speculate that the added salt stress potentiates the DNA-
damaging effects of spaceflight via the induction of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). The ability of salt stress to induce ROS
and subsequent DNA damage has been previously reported
[26] and, in particular, the yeast mitochondria appears to be
hypersensitive to this type of stress, consistent with its small
genome being susceptible to the effects of DNA damage [27].
Furthermore, mitochondrial protein abundance has been
shown to rapidly increase upon osmotic shock, and therefore
the enrichment for mitochondrial protein localization we
observe may reflect this requirement.
To gain further insight into the pathways that modulate
the response to both microgravity stress and combined space-
flight and salt stress, we used the GO enrichment profiles to
query a database of over 3200 distinct drug treatments of the
yeast deletion collections [13]. Specifically we quantified the
similarity between the GO enrichments by computing the
concordance of −log10(𝑃) between any two profiles, where
𝑃measures the significance of enrichment of a single GO
category. These concordance values are similar to Pearson
correlation values; that is, values closer to one indicate greater
similarity between profiles, except that high concordance also
requires the scale of values to be similar between the profiles.
When calculating concordance, we focused on GO biological
process enrichment profiles (Table S7).
One of the strong concordances was observed with 5-
fluorouridine (0.42), an FDA-approved anticancer drug that
is thought to also act by two mechanisms: (i) inhibiting
thymidylate synthetase and (ii) through metabolism into
cytotoxic ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides that can
be incorporated into DNA and RNA (Table 3) [14]. In
addition to being incorporated in DNA and RNA, we and
others have shown that the drug has been shown to inhibit the
essential ribonuclease activity of the exosome complex [28].
Similarly, carmofur, a derivative of 5-fluorouracil, displays
a concordance of 0.34. A similar concordance is seen with

5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), whose activity is identical to 5-
fluorouracil (5-FU). Finally, 8-methoxypsoralen, a DNA-
damaging agent that, upon photoactivation, conjugates and
forms covalent bonds with DNA, shows a congruence of 0.32.
This compound causes the formation of both monofunctional
(addition to a single strand of DNA) and bifunctional adducts
(crosslinking of psoralen to both strands of DNA) that
ultimately result in cell death.
We also found high concordance to the diallyl disulfide
profile (0.40), an agent that has been demonstrated to be
efficient for detoxification of a variety of cells. Diallyl disulfide
and related garlic derivatives have been shown to signifi-
cantly increase the production of the enzyme glutathione S-
transferase (GST), which binds electrophilic toxins in the
cell. Overloading the cell with inhibitory doses of diallyl
disulfide reveals genes required for survival in the presence
of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) [29].
In the case of the heterozygous collection, we found
significant GO enrichments for the following categories: lipid
metabolism, DNA catabolism, and regulation of transla-
tion and posttranslational modification (specifically protein
phosphorylation) (Figure 3). As expected (based on previous
studies of the heterozygous collection), both the number of
genes associated with FDs and the number of enriched cate-
gories are considerably smaller than those derived from the
homozygous collection [30]. This likely reflects two related
phenomena: first, genes that when deleted in heterozygotes
are sensitive to spaceflight encode proteins that participate in
the pathways identified in the homozygous collection, where
the fitness defect is stronger because the gene is completely
absent. Second, none of these heterozygote strains encode a
direct target of the perturbation.
Interestingly, when we searched for drug profiles with
high concordance with the spaceflight profiles derived from
the heterozygous collection, we detected modest concor-
dance with two human chemotherapeutics, mitoxantrone
(concordance = 0.19), and Epirubicin (congruence 0.142).
Both of these agents damage DNA by intercalating into
the DNA double helix and also by stabilizing the cleavable
complex that is the substrate of topoisomerase II [31–33].
4. Conclusions
The experiments presented here represent a proof of prin-
ciple for conducting full genome environmental screens in
spaceflight using robust hardware that can recapitulate a full
automation suite with environmental control in the space of a
small suitcase. The performance of this platform is significant
for spaceflight studies and promises to enable terrestrial
experiments in extreme environments that will have direct
application to microbial bioprocessing for manufacturing,
alternative fuel development, and basic research. The results
from these experiments suggest that spaceflight has subtle but
significant effects on core cellular processes including growth
control via RNA and ribosomal biogenesis, metabolism,
modification, and decay pathways. Furthermore, significant
roles for DNA repair and replication, response to pH signal-
ing, control of gene expression, and mitochondrial function
were observed. The yeast chemogenetic analysis of spaceflight
samples presented here strongly implicates DNA and RNA
damage as the major ground-based analogs of spaceflight
stress. Given the unique and substantial radiation exposure
in space, this is consistent with major radiation-mediated
effects. Unfortunately a 1 g control on ISS that might have
allowed better discrimination between the contributions of
space radiation versus the effects of microgravity on yeast
responses was not available to us at this time. Current on-
going experiments are designed explore these effects and
dissect them from other potentially confounding variables.
The high concordance to the profile induced by diallyl disul-
fide suggests increased glutathione S-transferase, binding of
electrophilic toxins, increased reactive oxygen species, and
change in redox state. These pathways, which are required for
survival in spaceflight, can guide future experiments in two
fundamental ways: firstly by suggesting environmental mod-
ifications that can bolster cellular and organismal integrity by
avoiding further stress to these pathways, and secondly, by
identifying drug stresses that can exacerbate these pathway
requirements in an effort to control pathological cell growth
in the case of proliferative diseases.
