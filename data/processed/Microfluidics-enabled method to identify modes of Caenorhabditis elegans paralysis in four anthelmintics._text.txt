The discovery of new drugs is often propelled by the increasing resistance of
parasites to existing drugs and the availability of better technology platforms. The
area of microﬂuidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds,
controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern
recognition. In most microﬂuidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g.,
Caenorhabditis elegans) are quantiﬁed by an end-point, dose response curve
representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). Here,
we present a multi-parameter extraction method to characterize modes of paralysis
in C. elegans over an extended time period. A microﬂuidic device with real-time
imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel,
levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine). We quantiﬁed worm behavior with
parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and
number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC75
where 75% of the worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent
concentrations, we observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed
in drug environments. Our study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on
small animal models with multiple parameters quantiﬁed at regular time points over
an extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in chemical
environments. V

I. INTRODUCTION
Parasitic nematodes have adopted a range of infection, survival, and propagation strategies
within hosts of interest, including humans, domestic animals (e.g., cows, pigs, sheep, horses),
and agricultural plants (e.g., soybean, corn, rice, potato).1–5 In particular, intestinal nematodes
affect over one-third of the human population and have a negative socioeconomic impact on
our society.6,7 Studies have shown that neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) arising from intesti-
nal nematodes can affect human growth, nutrition, cognition, productivity, intelligence, and
earnings. These effects are more pronounced in the poorest countries of the world where a pop-
ulation is strangled in poverty, low performance, and prolonged diseased state.4,6
Classes of compounds called anthelmintics have been developed and studied for the treat-
ment of intestinal nematodes.4,8,9 In the absence of available vaccines, anthelmintic chemother-
apy is the only choice for the control of intestinal infection in humans and livestock. Two of
these classes of drugs have been approved for use by the World Health Organization: benzimi-
dazoles and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. The common benzimidazoles
are mebendazole and albendazole.10 The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists are grouped
under two receptors subtypes they target: L-type and N-type.8 While levamisole and pyrantel

are examples of L-type nAChR agonists, methyridine is an example of N-type nAChR ago-
nist.7,9,11 Tribendimidine is relatively understudied and its mechanism of action is shown to be
similar to levamisole and pyrantel.6,12 With slow progress in the discovery of new anthelmin-
tics, parasitic worms have developed varying levels of resistance to these compounds.4 In fact,
multidrug resistance in parasitic worms is now recognized as a prevalent global menace that
overwhelms basic research in chemotherapeutic agents.4,12–14
Platforms to investigate the efﬁcacy and resistance of anthelmintics are dependent on the
choice of the biological host under study. In vivo animal assays are undoubtedly the best way
to test parasitic worms in their natural growth environment.5,15,16 These assays, however,
require large quantities of the compounds, huge spaces to house the animals, long wait times,
and thus higher research costs. Tests on smaller rodents such as mice and chicken are pragmatic
but require about 100 mg of the chemical and are impractical for any large-scale random
experiments with multiple chemicals. For these reasons, in vitro assays are the preferred choice
in parasitology, especially for primary screening. Standard in vitro assays measure the egg
count, larvae development, migration through membrane ﬁlters, and electrophysiological signals
of muscle tissues and ion channels.13,17,18
Caenorhabditis elegans is an established small animal model in parasitology for studying
novel drug targets and modes of drug action.14,19–21 The key reasons that contribute to its wide
acceptability are its matured genetics, short lifespan, small size, and conserved genes through
generations. Moreover, the relative ease of culturing C. elegans on agarose plates under standard
laboratory conditions is in contrast to culturing parasitic worms that have complex life
cycles.4,22–24 In this context, microﬂuidics has served as an enabling technology to study the
effects of different drugs and toxins on single or multiple C. elegans.25–27 Microﬂuidic devices
have integrated various techniques (e.g., droplet generation, automated valve operations, suction,
image recognition, laser ablation) to demonstrate high-throughput methods of loading, immobi-
lizing, sorting, and phenotyping worm populations.28,29 While these technological advancements
are commendable, it is reasonable to state that almost all microﬂuidic-enabled drug studies on C.
elegans portray the drug effect using a single parameter measured at a ﬁnite time (e.g., velocity,
stroke frequency).30,31 Macroscopic, inhibition migration assays also count the percentage of
worms surviving a chemical media within a ﬁnite time and plot the data as a dose response
curve.7,9,11,17 Are there other ways to characterize drug effects in these animals besides using a
single parameter measured at end-points of the experiments? If different drugs are chosen at the
same potency level, will they all exhibit a similar response on worm populations through the ex-
posure time? We hypothesized that the effect of a certain drug could change over the length of
experiment (as C. elegans is known to adapt to their environment)32 and quantifying the patterns
of worm adaptation could be used as a means to differentiate different drugs.
To test the above hypothesis, we used a two-dimensional microﬂuidic platform25 with real-
time imaging and a custom worm tracking software. Four anthelmintics are chosen that act on
the neuromuscular system of the C. elegans: pyrantel, levamisole, methyridine, and tribendimi-
dine. In each case, the drug concentration used is EC75 or where 75% of worms are responsive
to the drug. The worms are exposed to the individual drugs in a microﬂuidic device and their ac-
tivity is recorded for 40 min. Upon initial exposure, an active worm shows three types of move-
ment patterns; crawling, curling, and ﬂailing. After prolonged exposure, the active worm shows
periods of being immobile before ﬁnally succumbing to the drug. We characterize these behav-
ioral changes by a set of parameters and compared the results among the four drugs. Finally,
with an attempt to show the usefulness of this characterization technique for future drug screen-
ing, we justify our ﬁndings about the efﬁcacy of individual drugs using previous literature.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Device fabrication
The microﬂuidic device is fabricated using soft lithography.25,26 The device design is
drawn in AutoCADTM and sent out to an outside vendor (Fineline ImagingTM) for printing the
physical mask. A UV-sensitive polymer, SU-8, is spin-coated on a clean, 3-in. silicon wafer to
064103-2
Lycke, Parashar, and Pandey
Biomicrofluidics 7, 064103 (2013)

create a 80 lm thick layer. The SU-8 is photolithographically patterned with features on the
physical mask and developed. Then, particle desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) polymer is
poured on the SU-8 master mold and allowed to dry overnight in a low-pressure chamber at
room temperature. The dried PDMS is peeled off the SU-8 master mold, punched with holes
for the ﬂuidic ports, and irreversibly bonded to a glass slide—thus creating our microﬂuidic de-
vice. The SU-8 master mold is re-used multiple times to create new PDMS structures. Each
microﬂuidic device, however, is used only once for a single experiment.
B. Experimental setup
The microﬂuidic device is physically taped to a microscope stage and ﬁlled in a two-step
procedure as shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁlling procedure is modiﬁed from our previous work.25
Earlier, we ﬁlled the straight microchannels with agarose gel and then ﬁlled the drug well with
the drug solution. Worms were drawn into the microchannel and drug well using electrotaxis.
Electric ﬁelds were continuously applied through the experiment to prevent worms from leaving
the drug well. Here, the ﬁlling procedure was changed to apply electric ﬁelds only in the begin-
ning of the experiment. In the ﬁrst step, 0.8% agarose gel is loaded in a 1 ml syringe and
slowly ﬁlled into the straight microchannel. The ﬁlling is stopped when the forward proﬁle of
agarose gel, observed under the microscope, reaches the tapered mouth of the microchannel.
L4-stage C. elegans are picked from a culture plate with a sterilized wire and dropped at the
input port. After a wait time of around 5–7 min, the worms penetrate the agarose gel, enter the
microchannel, and migrate towards the tapered mouth. As the drug well is ﬁlled with air, the
worms are restricted in the microchannel. In the second step, anthelmintic solution under test is
prepared to a pre-speciﬁed concentration and ﬁlled in the drug well through a side port.
Speciﬁcally, in the cases of levamisole, pyrantel, and methyridine, the drug well is ﬁlled with a
mixture of 0.8% agarose prepared in M9 buffer and the anthelmintic. In the case of tribendimi-
dine, a mixture of 0.8% agarose prepared in M9 buffer and the anthelmintic dissolved in 1%
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used. For control experiments, 0.8% agarose in M9 buffer (with

and without 1% DMSO) is used. We previously concluded that there is minimal diffusion of
ﬂuorescein from the drug well during a 45-min experiment.25
To attract the worms to enter into the drug well, on-chip electrotaxis is used.25 Two plati-
num electrodes are inserted in the agarose gel, one in the input port and one in the side port,
and connected to a d.c. voltage supply by electrical cables. The net resistance between the plati-
num electrodes is measured to ensure there is a ﬁnite resistance of around 1–2 MX. An electric
ﬁeld is applied (5 V/cm) between the two electrodes and worms are coaxed into entering the
drug well. From placing the worms on the input port to the start of data collection, the wait
time is around 10 min. This time also allows the animals to acclimatize to the microﬂuidic
environment. A Leica MZ16 stereozoom microscope is connected with a high-speed QImaging
camera for real-time recording of worm behavior in the drug well. The QCapture software is
programmed to record grayscale images of the drug well (every second) for a period of 40 min.
Subsequently, the images are stitched into a single.avi ﬁle for data analysis. Each experiment is
conducted with a certain number of worms (n ﬃ3 to 5) and repeated over at least 4 independent
trials (N > ¼ 4). With every drug test, control experiments are conducted in parallel. Statistical
analysis on the data is performed using the GraphPad Prism software.
III. RESULTS
Previously, we reported the dose response (i.e., percentage of worms responsive to the
applied electric ﬁeld) of C. elegans upon exposure to levamisole.25 Using a similar protocol,
experiments are conducted with three other anthelmintics (tribendimidine, pyrantel, and methyri-
dine) and the C. elegans dose response is plotted in Fig. 2. To characterize the mode of paralysis
in each drug, we chose a critical concentration where 25% of the worms are responsive to the
applied electric ﬁeld (i.e., where 75% of the worms are responsive to the drug, EC75). At EC100,
worms paralyzed within a very short time to allow any characterization of drug effects; while at
EC50, worms took over an hour to paralyze resulting in larger videos and longer analysis time.
We chose EC75 as a reasonable concentration for drug potency as most worms paralyzed within
20–25 min with adequate time for exhibiting their drug response. From Fig. 2, this concentration
for each drug is as follows: 30 lm levamisole, 100 lm tribendimidine, 150 lm pyrantel, and
10 mM methyridine. Next, we show that even at these equipotent concentrations, each drug have
a distinct signature effect on worm populations observed over the entire experimental time.
A. Frequency of body curls
One of our ﬁrst observations indicated that worms tend to curl more often in drug environ-
ments than in control conditions. Fig. 3(a) shows a series of images to describe the progression
FIG. 2. The dose response of C. elegans (represented as the percentage of worms responsive to electrical ﬁelds) is plotted
for the four drugs used: pyrantel, levamisole, methyridine, and tribendimidine.

of a curl exhibited by a sample worm in the microﬂuidic drug well. For our analysis, a curl is
deﬁned as an event that occurs when a worm’s head touches or overlaps its tail. Using this deﬁ-
nition, we manually count the total number of curls exhibited by an actively moving worm
before it eventually paralyzes. Thereafter, the frequency of body curls (i.e., number of curls per
second) is calculated by dividing the total number of curls by the total active time. The fre-
quency of body curls is calculated as follows: 0.007 6 0.005 for agar, 0.010 6 0.010 for
DMSO, 0.042 6 0.030 for pyrantel, 0.031 6 0.020 for levamisole, 0.014 6 0.010 for methyri-
dine, and 0.032 6 0.026 for tribendimidine. In Fig. 3(b), we plot the frequency of body curls as
a box plot representation. Here, the bottom and top of each box correspond to the ﬁrst and third
quartiles, respectively, while the horizontal line inside the box denotes the median. The ends of
whiskers are the minimum and maximum values of the data set. We compared the results of
pyrantel, levamisole, and methyridine with their corresponding control (i.e., 0.8% agarose) and
tribendimidine with its control (i.e., 0.8% agarose and 1% DMSO). There is no signiﬁcant dif-
ference between the two control groups. However, the curl frequency is signiﬁcantly higher in
pyrantel and levamisole (p < 0.0001). Between DMSO and tribendimidine, we observed a sig-
niﬁcantly higher curl frequency in tribendimidine (p < 0.0001). The curl frequency is signiﬁ-
cantly lower in methyridine than in pyrantel, levamisole, and tribendimidine (p < 0.0001). This
indicates that curling is not as predominant in methyridine as in other compounds. To describe
the action of methyridine and to further differentiate among other drugs, we needed more pa-
rameters that could be extracted from recorded videos.
B. Mode transitions in an actively moving worm: Crawling, curling, or flailing
Besides frequent curling actions, an actively moving worm exhibits changes from its natu-
ral sinusoidal movement when exposed to drug environments. As shown in Fig. 4(a), we cate-
gorize the nature of a worm’s body displacement into three modes: crawling, curling, and ﬂail-
ing. Crawling is the undulatory, sinusoidal movement of a worm that results in forward or
backward locomotion.33 Curling, as deﬁned earlier, occurs when the worm’s head touches or
overlaps its tail. Flailing happens when a worm oscillates its body in half waves about a ﬁxed
location and is an unusual swimming-like behavior we observed in 0.8% agarose gel.
During an experiment, an active worm may exhibit any of the three abovementioned modes
of movement (i.e., crawling, curling, and ﬂailing). We manually counted the transitions made
by an active worm amongst the three modes of movement. The number of mode transitions is

counted within three time periods (30 s, 60 s, and 120 s) from the instance a worm enters into
the drug well. A transition frequency is calculated by dividing the number of mode transitions
by the time periods of observation. These data are plotted in Fig. 4(b). The transition frequency
is signiﬁcantly higher in methyridine than in tribendimidine (p < 0.01 in 30 s, p < 0.001 in 60
and 120 s). The transition frequency is also signiﬁcantly higher in pyrantel than in tribendimi-
dine (p < 0.05 in 30 s, p < 0.01 in 60 and 120 s). Between levamisole and methyridine, there is
signiﬁcant difference in the 30 s and 120 s periods (p < 0.05). Interestingly, worms exhibited
more frequent ﬂailing motion in methyridine than in the other three drugs. In control tests with
agar (data not shown), there are no mode transitions because all worms are seen crawling with
no curling or ﬂailing.
C. Immobilization patterns leading to paralysis: Being active, temporarily, or
permanently immobilized
As the time of exposure increases, a drug may cause an actively moving worm to show
periods of being (partially or completely) immobilized. We grouped these immobilization pat-
terns into three categories: being active, temporarily immobilized or permanently immobilized.
From our deﬁnition, a worm is considered active (or actively moving) if its entire body is dis-
placed from its original location within a given timeframe (1 s in our case). A worm is perma-
nently immobilized if its entire body remains stationary for at least 600 s, after which we
denote the worm as being paralyzed. Our videos indicate that worms that remained immobilized
for 600 s never recovered through the length of experiment. A worm is temporarily immobi-
lized if parts of its body (and not the entire body) are still moving or if it can become active af-
ter being completely immobile for a certain time period (less than 600 s).
Fig. 5(a) illustrates the immobilization patterns for a sample worm in the microﬂuidic de-
vice. We used a custom worm tracking program to locate the body centroid of individual
worms in the drug well over the length of the video.25 Tracks of a sample worm are plotted to
show three cycles periods of being active and temporarily immobilized. During each active pe-
riod, the worm moves freely and its track appears linear; while in each temporarily immobilized
period, a part of the worm’s body shows spasm-like events and its track appears to be zigzag
without much displacement. Eventually, the worm may enter a permanently immobilized period
where it becomes completely motionless for over 600 s.

(head coiled to or beyond the tail), crawling (sinusoidal movement), and ﬂailing (swimming movement with no net dis-
placement). (b) Boxplot representations of the transition frequency (rate of switching between crawling, curling, and ﬂail-
ing) within 30 s (left), 60 s (middle), and 120 s (right) from the time of entering the drug well.

Fig. 5(b) plots the percentage of worms that were active, temporarily immobilized, or per-
manently immobilized at the end of their 40 min drug exposure. In control conditions, a negli-
gible fraction of worms is permanently immobilized. Compared to other drugs, a higher per-
centage of worms (68%) remain active in methyridine. In pyrantel, none of the worms are
active and the population is either temporarily (53.33%) or permanently immobilized (46.66%).
The percentages of permanently immobilized worms are comparatively higher in pyrantel and
tribendimidine (48.57%) than in other chemical media.
D. Active and immobilization periods: Count and time duration
Thus far, we characterized an actively moving worm by transitions between crawling, curl-
ing, and ﬂailing. We saw that prolonged drug exposure can cause an active worm to enter tem-
porary or permanent immobilization, which was measured at the end of the 40-min experiment.
To add further insights to the time-dependent progression of drug activity, we explored how of-
ten and how long an active worm enters periods of immobilization before completely succumb-
ing to the drug.
The time duration a worm spends in each active or immobilization period also varies in the
four drug environments. In Fig. 6, we plot the time spent by worms in the individual active and
immobilization
period,
respectively.

subsequent analyses. In Fig. 7, we plot the probability for a worm being active. Active worms
are assigned a probability of 1, and immobile worms have a probability of 0. The median of
time durations during each active or immobilization period (from Fig. 6) is estimated and used
to plot this ﬁgure. In general, the time spent in each active period (shown as green bars, Fig. 6)
decreases with increasing exposure time. On the other hand, the time spent in each immobiliza-
tion period (shown as red bars, Fig. 6) increases with increasing exposure time (except for pyr-
antel). In other words, an active worm starts pausing for longer time durations (with shorter
periods of being active) upon increasing exposure to the drug. In tribendimidine, the time spent
in the ﬁrst two immobilization periods is signiﬁcantly higher than in other drugs (p < 0.0001).
In some worms, the effect of levamisole exposure is even reversible suggesting that this drug
may be the least potent amongst the four anthelmintics. All worms remained active in 0.8%
agarose and never entered the second immobilization period.
IV. DISCUSSION
Some modiﬁcations were made in our device design and methodology to simplify the ear-
lier experimental method25 and optimize it for observing events leading to worm paralysis. It
was seen that electric ﬁeld was needed only initially to coax the worms into the drug well.
When sufﬁcient number of worms entered the drug well, the electric ﬁeld was switched off
(typically after the ﬁrst 5–7 min). At the optimal range of electric ﬁelds (5 V/cm), we did not
observe any behavioral changes in the presence of electric ﬁelds.25 In addition, the device
dimensions were altered to minimize the chances of a worm leaving the drug well in absence
of electric ﬁelds. For this, the tapered mouth was made narrower and only one side port was
included. The two-step agarose ﬁlling process (Fig. 1) was also better controlled with a nar-
rower mouth and allowed us to control the time instance when worms enter the drug well. The
length of the microchannel was shortened, so the wait time for worm entry into the drug well
is reduced. Shrinking the lateral dimensions of every device allowed us to ﬁt up to four devices
within the microscope’s ﬁeld of view for parallel runs. Furthermore, in contrast to quantifying
drug effects by the sensitivity of electric ﬁelds at pre- and post-exposure time instances,25 we

nently immobilized. Each pair of active and immobilization periods is numbered sequentially in the y-axis.

extracted parameters related to movement, immobilization, and body shapes through the period
of drug exposure and attempted to show differences across four drugs.
In equipotent concentrations of both pyrantel and levamisole, the worms exhibited similar
movement phenotypes. We observed that an active worm moves in a sinusoidal manner with
periods of immobilization where it curls its body and eventually paralyzes. In both chemical
environments, a worm undergoes at least ﬁve to six active and immobilization periods (Figs. 6
and 7). The average time spent in each active period is similar in both cases and markedly dis-
tinct compared to those in methyridine and tribendimidine (Fig. 6). The inherent similarities
between movement phenotypes in pyrantel and levamisole do suggest that these drugs act on
the same subtype of nAChR receptors (i.e., L-subtype).7–9,11,34 However, there are some differ-
ences between pyrantel and levamisole. The average time spent in each immobilization period
is longer in pyrantel than in levamisole (Fig. 6). In other words, an active worm in pyrantel pre-
fers to rest longer, curl up, or move less often; whereas an active worm in levamisole spends
similar time durations being active or resting/curling. This is also reﬂected in Fig. 5 where, at
the end of an experiment, no worms in pyrantel appear active and are either temporarily or per-
manently immobilized; whereas around 30% worms are still active in levamisole. These differ-
ences suggest that pyrantel may be more effective than levamisole, even being at the same po-
tency concentrations.7
A comparison between tribendimidine and the other two L-subtype nAChR agonists, leva-
misole and pyrantel, is worth discussing here. It has been shown that tribendimidine affects C.
elegans using a similar pathway as levamisole and hence belong to the same class of L-subtype
nAChR agonists.6 Since these three drugs have similar mechanisms of action, should we expect
differences in the patterns of paralysis? In general, movement phenotypes in tribendimidine are
same as those in pyrantel and levamisole. One key difference is noted in the number of active
periods and duration of immobilization. In tribendimidine, the number of active periods is
reduced and the time duration of immobilization periods is much increased compared to those
in levamisole or pyrantel (Fig. 6). This may indicate that tribendimidine is more effective at a
FIG. 7. The ﬁgure shows the probability of a worm being active during the length of drug exposure. The median of time
durations for active and immobilized periods are calculated from Figure 6. The probability of a worm being active is
denoted as 1 while that of being immobilized is denoted as 0.

single dose than levamisole or pyrantel. Evidence of tribendimidine’s superior performance
compared to the other two L-type nAChR agonists (i.e., levamisole and pyrantel) at single-dose
levels has also been suggested in recent studies performed on treating Ascaris or hook-
worms.35,36 In addition, the increased number of active periods in levamisole may indicate that
worms could recover from drug exposure, if given at concentrations below 10 lm with recovery
time over 2 h (data not shown). Hence, we feel that our derived parameters (such as number of
active periods and time durations of immobilization) could help compare the effectiveness of a
single or a cocktail of multiple anthelmintics for single dose therapies where irreversible paraly-
sis is desired. Of course, this characterization method would serve as a preliminary test to sup-
plement standard in vivo experiments.12
In methyridine, we noticed a distinct departure from the movement phenotype associated
with levamisole, pyrantel, and tribendimidine. In this drug, worms exhibited a swimming-like
motion where the body formed half waves during moving. Occasionally, the worms would
thrash about a ﬁxed location (that we deﬁned as ﬂailing) and then continue their swimming-like
motion. Swimming motion is typically seen in C. elegans when the surrounding medium is liq-
uid. It was interesting to observe this swimming-like behavior in the presence of methyridine
where the surrounding medium was 0.8% agarose gel. Considering that methyridine acts on the
same nAChR receptor, our observed difference in movement could suggest that this drug acts
on a different subtype of nAChR receptor. This assumption is in line with previous studies
showing that methyridine target N-subtype nAChR receptors and not the L-subtype nAChR
receptors.11
In our view, this microﬂuidic-enabled characterization method will broaden the scope of
data extraction from drug screening experiments, improve our understanding of worm resistance
and adaptability in adverse chemical environments, and provide faster ways of predicting new
and existing drug targets prior to detailed electrophysiological experiments. To the best of our
knowledge, such a detailed characterization of worm paralysis upon exposure to anthelmintics
has not been conducted before. While we investigated behavioral changes in wild-type C. ele-
gans leading to paralysis, further tests with relevant mutants and parasites could help establish
relationships between molecular mechanisms of drug action and the observed phenotypes.1,37–41
In this regard, C. elegans and other model organisms are gaining increased attention for the
rapid screening of large sets of small molecules (e.g., membrane-permeable inhibitors of protein
function) that induce phenotypic changes in the worm, such as lethality, unco-ordinated move-
ment, slow growth and development, and morphological defects.42 It is expected that the process
of discovering novel drugs would rely on large-scale behavioral screening of worms, measure-
ment of multiple parameters with sufﬁcient resolution, standardization of observed phenotypes
across disparate platforms, and linkage between the chemical and behavioral libraries.43,44
Interested readers, who wish to use and test our devices on other chemicals or mutants, are
welcome to directly email the corresponding author (S.P.). We can provide the fabricated
microﬂuidic devices and tracking software, and discuss the steps for setting up experiments.
The device dimensions can be further altered and customized for other parasitic nematodes. A
standard desktop computer compatible with Microsoft Windows 7, a large-capacity hard drive,
and a microscope with attached camera will be required.
V. CONCLUSION
In summary, we presented a method to characterize the behavioral events of C. elegans
over an extended time period: from exposure to the drug to their eventual paralysis. We found
that a single parameter was unable to capture the overall drug effects through the experimental
period. So, multiple parameters were calculated, such as curls per second, types of paralyzation,
mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. We found that pyrantel
is more effective than levamisole in immobilizing the worms at the end of the 40-min experi-
ments. In tribendimidine, worms display shorter number of active periods before permanently
immobilizing than in pyrantel or levamisole. In methyridine, worms exhibit a swimming-like
movement that is different from the normal crawling movement in pyrantel, levamisole, and

tribendimidine. Our results may suggest the following: methyridine acts on a different subtype
of nAChR receptors than the other three anthelmintics, the action of pyrantel and levamisole is
similar but pyrantel is more effective than levamisole, and tribendimidine is more potent than
pyrantel or levamisole in causing an irreversible paralysis of the worms. This multi-parameter
extraction method expands the repertoire of phenotypic characterization tools available in exist-
ing drug-based microﬂuidic devices. In addition, the method could complement rigorous elec-
trophysiological experiments to rapidly test screen compounds against nematodes, establish suit-
able drug candidates, and predict the class of target receptor subtypes.
