The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface
environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and
protection of that planet from forward contamination by human
and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is
frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial
analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates
were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia
capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low
pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S
ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identiﬁed
as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C.
inhibens (ﬁve isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative
growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as
well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. alterfunditum, C.
divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. maltaromati-
cum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable
of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extend-
ing the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.
astrobiology | planetary protection
A
central goal of astrobiology is to explore the limits at which
life can occur and to search for life and habitable locations
outside Earth (1). The planet Mars is considered a promising
astrobiological exploration target owing to its relative proximity
and similarity to Earth, coupled with increasing evidence pointing
to the past and present existence of liquid water at the surface
and near subsurface (2–4). The current surface environment of
Mars presents formidable challenges to life, such as a scarcity of
liquid water and organic nutrients, extreme low temperatures, a
low-pressure CO2-dominated atmosphere, harsh solar and galactic
cosmic radiation, and a lack of organic nutrients (5). To address
the question of whether terrestrial life could survive and grow in
the martian environment, several researchers have turned to Mars
environmental simulations conducted in chambers that replicate
the temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, regolith
composition, and solar radiation environment of the Mars surface
and near subsurface (6). Results from past experiments testing the
ability of dozens of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in one such
simulator demonstrated that the combination of low pressure
(P; 7 mbar), low temperature (T; 0 °C), and anoxic atmosphere
(A), called here low-PTA conditions, posed signiﬁcant barriers to
growth (5, 7, 8).
Because much of the water on present-day Mars exists in a
permanently frozen state mixed with mineral matrix, permafrosts
on Earth are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian
environment (9). On the basis of similarities between martian
regolith and terrestrial permafrost, we reasoned that perma-
frost might contain microbes capable of growth under low-PTA
conditions. In this communication we report that screening of ca.
10,000 microbes obtained from four Siberian permafrost samples
resulted in the isolation of six bacterial strains capable of growth
under low-PTA conditions, and that all of these isolates belonged
to the Gram-positive genus Carnobacterium.
Results and Discussion
Isolation of Microorganisms from Siberian Permafrost. Samples of
permafrost obtained from the Siberian arctic (Fig. 1) were sus-
pended and plated on trypticase soy broth yeast extract salt
(TSBYS) medium and incubated at room temperature (ca. 23 °C)
for up to 28 d. Colonies were either picked or replica-plated onto
fresh TSBYS plates and incubated for 30 d under low-PTA con-
ditions. Out of a total of ∼9.3 × 103 colonies tested from four
different permafrost soil samples, 6 colonies were observed to
grow under low-PTA conditions (Table 1). Five isolates, (strains
WN1359 and WN1370–WN1373) were obtained from permafrost
soil sample 4, and a single isolate (strain WN1374) was obtained
from soil sample 9 (Table 1).
Growth of Permafrost Isolates Under Low-PTA Conditions. To further
understand the effects of temperature, atmospheric composition,
and pressure on permafrost isolates, the following experiment was
performed, depicted in Fig. 2. One hundred isolates from per-
mafrost samples 4, 5, 8, and 9 were picked onto triplicate TSBYS
plates. All plates were incubated at 0 °C for 30 d under different
combinations of atmosphere and pressure. The TSBYS plate in-
cubated at Earth atmospheric composition and pressure (i.e., low-
T conditions) showed luxuriant colony development with a variety
of different colony morphotypes, including distinctive orange
colonies (Fig. 2A). On the replicate TSBYS plate incubated under
anoxic atmosphere but Earth-normal pressure of 1,013 mbar (i.e.,
low-TA conditions) only one colony, number 43, was able to grow
(Fig. 2B). This same colony was also able to grow at 7 mbar
pressure under full low-PTA conditions (Fig. 2C); in fact, it
seemed that colony 43 actually grew best under low-PTA con-
ditions (compare in Fig. 2 panels A, B, and C). Isolate 43 was
streak-puriﬁed and designated strain WN1359. Despite the fact
that growth of the other 99 colonies was severely inhibited by 30
d of exposure to low-PTA conditions, all colonies recovered and
grew rapidly (within 24 h) upon return to laboratory benchtop
conditions (Fig. 2D). This result is in good agreement with pre-
vious observations that growth inhibition of microbes caused by
exposure to low pressure is apparently nonlethal and rapidly re-
versible (7, 10).
Identiﬁcation of Permafrost Isolates as Carnobacterium spp. The 16S
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences were determined for all six
isolates that could grow under low-PTA conditions (Table 1) and

were compared with the16S rDNA database in the Ribosomal
Database Project (Fig. 3). All ﬁve isolates from permafrost sam-
ple 4 were found to be most closely related to Carnobacterium
inhibens type strain DSM13024T, with the following % identities:
WN1359 (94.9%), WN1370 (95.7%), WN1371 (95.9%), WN1372
(96.4%), and WN1373 (96.6%). The sole isolate from permafrost
sample 9, strain WN1374, was found to be most closely related to
Carnobacterium viridans type strain DSM14451T (96.7%). Using
the molecular criteria that bacterial species and genera demon-
strate >97% and >95% 16S rDNA sequence identity, respectively
(11, 12), the permafrost isolates likely represent unique species
of the genus Carnobacterium; however, deﬁnitive designation of
species status must await more rigorous taxonomic characterization
(13). It is quite interesting to note that the 16S rDNA sequences
from all ﬁve Carnobacterium spp. isolates obtained from perma-
frost sample 4 were found to be >97% identical to Carnobacterium
sp. strain LV62:W1 isolated from Lake Vanda, Antarctica (Gen-
Bank accession no. AF076637) (14). Furthermore, 16S rDNA from
the single strain isolated from permafrost sample 9 was >97%
identical to that of Carnobacterium sp. strain ARCTIC-P35
(GenBank accession no. AY573048 (15). Thus, all of the per-
mafrost isolates obtained in this study were most closely related
to other Carnobacterium spp. isolated from Arctic and Antarctic
environments.
Several of the distinctive orange colonies (Fig. 2) were also
characterized by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as most closely
related to the Gram-positive psychrophile Exiguobacterium sibiricum
strain 7-3, which was previously reported to have been isolated from
permafrost samples obtained from the Kolyma region by one of the
authors (D.G.) (16). Although these isolates were unable to grow
under low-PTA conditions (Fig. 2), this observation lent greater
conﬁdence that the Carnobacterium spp. isolates described here
indeed originated from permafrost and were not contaminants.
Growth Kinetics of Permafrost Isolates and Carnobacterium Type
Species Under Low-PTA Conditions. At present, the genus Car-
nobacterium consists of ten recognized species: C. alterfunditum,
C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. jeotgali,
C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans. All
Carnobacterium species to date are capable of growing at low

temperatures and have been isolated from a wide variety of envi-
ronments, including the Arctic and Antarctic (Table 2). This ob-
servation prompted us to quantify the growth kinetics under low-
PTA conditions of both the permafrost isolates and nine type
species of Carnobacterium. A typical experiment performed on
triplicate samples of permafrost strain WN1359 (Fig. 4) showed
that strain WN1359 grew better under low-TA conditions (tri-
angles) than low-T conditions (circles), and grew best under low-
PTA conditions (squares).
The same experiment depicted for strain WN1359 in Fig. 4 was
also conducted on all six permafrost isolates (Fig. 5A) and nine
Carnobacterium spp. type strains (Fig. 5B); to conserve space, the
data were converted to number of generations each strain grew
over the 28-d course of the experiment (Materials and Methods).
All bacteria were capable of growth under low-PTA conditions, but
several distinct patterns of growth under different environmental
conditions emerged (Fig. 5). For convenience, the growth pat-
tern observed by strain WN1359 is designated here as abc,
following its statistical grouping (Fig. 5A). In other words, growth
followed the pattern low-PTA > low-TA > low-T (Fig. 5A). In
addition to strain WN1359, strains WN1370, WN1373, C. mobile,
and C. inhibens also exhibited the abc pattern of growth (Fig. 5).
Other growth patterns were also discernible. For example, several
bacteria demonstrated an abb growth pattern (i.e., their growth
followed the pattern low-TA = low-PTA > low-T). These strains
included permafrost strain WN1374, C. gallinarum, C. viridans,
C. divergens, C. funditum, and C. alterfunditum. Strains WN1372
and C. pleistocenium exhibited an aab growth pattern, in which
they only grew better under low-PTA conditions (Fig. 5). Finally,
strains WN1371 and C. maltaromaticum exhibited an aaa growth
pattern in which no statistical difference in growth was detected
under the three conditions tested. For comparative purposes,
the same experiment was performed on S. liquefaciens strain
ATCC7529, also recently shown to grow at 7 mbar, which
exhibited an aaa type growth pattern.
Conclusions. From this work it can be seen that microbial com-
munities from Siberian permafrost contain organisms capable of

growing under conditions of low temperature, low pressure, and
anoxic CO2-dominated atmosphere. It should be stressed, however,
that low-PTA conditions are only a subset of the total potentially
biotoxic physical factors constraining the survival or growth of ter-
restrial microbes on Mars, such as solar UV, extreme desiccation,
solar particle events, and galactic cosmic rays. In addition, the
martian regolith itself contains numerous potentially biotoxic
factors, such as salinity, pH, and Eh of available liquid water;
oxidizing soils created by UV-induced processes and soil chemical
reactions; or the presence of heavy metals (discussed extensively
in refs. 7 and 17).
Not all of the tested permafrost soil samples yielded isolates,
perhaps because the initial incubations were performed at room
temperature (ca. 23 °C), which would inhibit the growth of strict
psychrophiles; however, all isolates obtained from this set of ex-
periments belonged to the genus Carnobacterium. As its name
suggests, the ﬁrst isolates of the genus were obtained as puta-
tive spoilage organisms of meat products. In this regard it is
interesting to note that three species, C. gallinarum, C. viridans,
and C. divergens, were all isolated from refrigerated vacuum-
packed meats (Table 2), suggesting the ability of these microbes
to grow under cold, low-pressure conditions. Several Carno-
bacterium spp. have also been isolated from permanently cold
environments (C. alterfunditum, C. funditum), including arctic
permafrost (C. pleistocenium) (Table 2). The extreme age of the
Siberian permafrost isolates reported here (∼6,000–8,000 y) and
the Alaskan permafrost isolate C. pleistocenium (∼32,000 y) (18)
indicates that these species are capable of long periods of survival in
permanently frozen environments.
Terrestrial life has evolved mechanisms to tolerate and indeed
ﬂourish in extreme high-pressure habitats such as the deep ocean
(19), but very little is understood regarding microbial responses
to low pressure, a physical constraint not found in nature on the
Earth’s surface. The discovery of terrestrial bacteria that can
inhabit cold, low-pressure, anoxic environments has implications
for the ﬁelds of extremophile biology, astrobiology, the search for
extraterrestrial life, and planetary protection. Permafrosts seem
to be promising locations for the isolation of microbes capable of
growth under cold, anoxic, and hypobaric conditions such as are
encountered on Mars. It is anticipated that further sampling of
permafrost from other locations or depths will yield additional
microbes exhibiting this unique set of properties.
Materials and Methods
Permafrost Samples. Permafrost samples with a mean annual temperature
of −7 °C were taken in the forest-tundra zone of northeastern Siberia
(68.633°N, 159.079°E, the right bank of the Kolyma River) (Fig. 1) using a dry
drilling rig that operates without ﬂuids and prevents down-hole contami-
nation (20). Four frozen soil samples, 4, 5, 8, and 9, were collected from
the depths of 12.7, 16.5, 20.1, and 21.8 m below the surface, respectively.
The strict protocols for drilling and the subsequent handling of cores were
designed to ensure that uncontaminated material was retrieved (20). After
removal from the corer, the surfaces of the cores (68- to 107-mm diameter)
were cleaned by shaving off the outer layers with an alcohol-sterilized knife.
For microbiological studies the cores were split into 5-cm-long segments,
placed into sterile plastic bags, stored frozen in the ﬁeld within a hole exca-
vated in the permafrost, transported frozen to the Soil Cryology Laboratory in
Pushchino, Russia, and then transported frozen by air to Kennedy Space
Center, FL. The samples represent epigenetically frozen layers of Holocene
age (6–8 kyBP) formed by refreezing of sediments that had melted and
drained. They are hydrocarbonate-calcium ﬁne-grained peaty sandy-loams,
ﬁrmly bound by ice (ice content 25–37%), with pH close to neutral (6.8–7.2)
and containing organic carbon (0.5–2.0%).
Microbiological Techniques. Medium used throughout was TSBYS medium
containing (per L): trypticase soy broth, 30 g; yeast extract, 3 g; NaCl, 13 g; KCl,
0.34 g; MgCl2 × 6H2O, 4 g; MgSO4 × 7 H2O, 3.45 g; NH4Cl, 0.25 g; CaCl2 ×
2H2O, 0.14 g. For plates, TSBYS was solidiﬁed with agar (15 g/L). Permafrost

samples (0.9–1.4 g) were diluted serially 10-fold in double-distilled water,
plated on TSBYS agar, and incubated at room temperature (ca. 23 °C) for times
ranging from 1 to 30 d. Colonies arising were either replica-plated or picked
onto fresh TSBYS plates in 100-colony grid patterns and exposed to envi-
ronmental simulations (example in Fig. 2). Each colony able to grow under
simulated Mars conditions was picked, streak-puriﬁed, grown overnight
in TSBYS liquid medium, and stored as a frozen glycerol stock at −70 °C.
Carnobacterium type strains were obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ)-German Collection of Micro-
organisms and Cell Cultures (www.dsmz.de). All strains used are listed in
Table 2.
Low-PTA Simulations. The hypobaric system used for attaining low-PTA con-
ditions has been described in detail (7). In brief, a 4-L polystyrene desiccator was
placed in a low-temperature incubator set at 0 °C and connected to a low-
pressure controller and vacuum pump (model PU-842; KNF Neuberger). In-
oculated TSBYS plates were inserted into the desiccator, agar surface upward
(i.e., not inverted). Six anaerobic pouches (model R681001 AnaeroPacks, Remel,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) were placed inside with the vertically stacked plates.
The system was then ﬂushed with ultra-high-purity CO2 and the desiccator
sealed; this constituted anoxic atmosphere. The pressure inside the desic-
cator was either left at Earth-normal level (1,013 mbar) or pumped down
to 7 mbar, the global average Mars surface pressure (5). At 7-d intervals
the hypobaric chamber was vented to laboratory atmosphere, samples re-
moved for assay, the anaerobic pouches replaced, and the system returned
to test conditions. The anaerobic pouches have been shown to reduce the
O2 concentration to <0.1% within 1 h (21). All plates were maintained for
up to 30 d at 0 °C.
Quantitative Growth Assays. Two microliters of a fresh overnight culture
made in liquid TSBYS (containing from 5 × 104 to 5 × 106 cells) were spotted
in triplicate onto TSBYS plates and incubated under low-PTA conditions. At
weekly intervals, agar blocks containing the cell spots were cut out of the
plates with a sterile scalpel and placed individually into 1 mL of sterile PBS
(10 mM potassium phosphate and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Cells were sus-
pended by vortexing, diluted serially 10-fold, and plated for viable cells on
TSBYS plates incubated at room temperature. Numbers of generations (n)
were calculated using the equation
n = ½lnðN2=N1Þ=0:693;
where N1 and N2 are the number of cells per spot at 0 and 4 wk, respectively (22).
Molecular Taxonomy of Strains by 16S rDNA Analysis. Chromosomal DNA
was puriﬁed and 16S rDNAs were ampliﬁed and sequenced as described
previously (23). 16S rDNA sequences were used to query the Ribosomal
Database Project (RDP) database (24) (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). The phylo-
genetic tree was built with the RDP Tree Builder using the Weighbor weighted
neighbor-joining tree-building algorithm. All 16S rDNA sequences have been
deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers denoted in Fig. 3.
