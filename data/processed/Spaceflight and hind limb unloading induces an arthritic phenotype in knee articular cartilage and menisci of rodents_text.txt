Reduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are associated with cartilage 
degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb 
unloading (HLU) represent unique opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated 
arthritic changes in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee 
after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full weight-bearing. Cartilage 
and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or 
biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the 
Space Shuttle Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing readaptation with/
without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU occurred at similar spatial locations, the 
tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal 
glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated catabolic enzymes (e.g., 
matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses 
in menisci. After the 13-day Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed. During readaptation, 
recovery of cartilage volume and thickness occurred with exercise. Reduced weight-bearing from 
either spaceflight or HLU induced an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and menisci, and exercise 
promoted recovery.
Osteoarthritis (OA) can lead to pain and disability resulting in decreased health-related quality of life, with 
associated loss of productivity and high treatment-related ­costs1,2. The reasons for knee OA are thought to be 
a complex interaction between patient risk factors (age, sex, race, genetic factors, obesity, diet, exercise) and 
abnormal mechanical loading of the joint (posttraumatic or malalignment)3. In particular, articular cartilage 
and menisci are sensitive to different loading conditions, and the meniscal degradation and loss of function that 
occurs in relation to risk factors may result in cartilage degradation and subsequent ­OA4,5. While excessive load-
ing from patient ­obesity3 or repetitive loading from high impact activities can contribute to OA ­development6,7,

reduced weight-bearing both prescribed and due to a sedentary lifestyle without physical activity have also been 
associated with cartilage ­degradation8–15.
Reduced weight-bearing studies have demonstrated deterioration of articular cartilage occurs similarly to 
excessive loading, resulting in cartilage ­degradation5,6,10,13–15. Cartilage degradation, thinning, and loss of glycosa-
minoglycans (GAGS), which impart compressive properties to cartilage, have been measured in humans after 
post-surgical limb immobilization and spinal cord injury ­simulations10,11,15. Even partial loading leads to substan-
tial cartilage loss, with 6–8% of cartilage thinning occurring after less than 2 ­months10,11. Reduced weight-bearing 
in rodent models of hind limb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension, or spinal cord injury, likewise results in 
cartilage ­degradation16–19. Short-term periods of HLU (13 days) in rats increases pro-arthritic biomarkers in knee 
cartilage, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and loss of GAG ­content19. These responses are similar to 
elevated MMP-3 expression and lower GAG content in rat knees after 21 days of limb ­immobilization20. Longer 
periods of HLU (30 days) in female mice results in articular cartilage loss at the weight-bearing tibial-femoral 
cartilage contact point, increases MMP-13 concentration with associated decrease in collagen ­concentration16, 
and alters signaling pathways associated with joint degradation in femoral head articular ­cartilage16. Short-term 
exposure of chondrocytes to low weight-bearing conditions alters matrix metabolism, however collagen II and 
proteoglycan production is increased while collagen X is lowered, which could be considered a favorable meta-
bolic ­response21. In general, short and long term periods of reduced weight-bearing alter chondrocyte metabolism 
and cartilage health, and is disadvantageous to joint health.
Rodents exposed to microgravity in spaceflight experience reduced weight-bearing across joints without the 
full knee joint immobilization typical of preclinical ­studies22, representing a unique model to study joint tissue 
responses to unloading. Rapid bone loss and muscle wasting in both rodents and astronauts are well-documented 
consequences of the skeletal disuse that occurs during periods of ­microgravity23,24. Limited data exist regarding 
rodent joint responses to spaceflight. Of note, sulfated GAG reduction measured histologically from mouse knee 
articular cartilage was reported after 30 days in orbit aboard the satellite ­Bion25. Additionally, very few studies 
have examined the response of menisci to reduced loading in general. The meniscal response to reduced weight-
bearing is unclear; preclinical studies identify both ­degenerative8,26 and ­protective27,28 effects of immobilization, 
but molecular mechanisms for either response are unknown. Further evaluation of microgravity on meniscus 
cells is necessary to understand the joint degradation that may occur during spaceflight, and the complex rela-
tionship these structures play in maintaining joint homeostasis.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate how actual and simulated spaceflight conditions with reduced 
weight-bearing affect both the cartilage and the meniscus of the medial knee compartment, the most common 
site of knee ­OA29 that experiences the highest loads across the ­joint30. We hypothesized that reduced-weight 
bearing would lead to degradation of these structures and a generalized arthritic response. Cartilage and meniscal 
degradation were measured in male mice after ~ 35 days in orbit aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as 
part of the Rodent Research 9 (RR9) ­mission31. As a comparative study for the ISS investigation, we examined 
gross phenotypic and histologic changes in cartilage and menisci from age-matched male mice that were exposed 
to 30 days of reduced weight-bearing via HLU, followed by a 49 day readaptation (return to weight-bearing) 
portion that examined if running or climbing exercises could recover any cartilage and meniscal degradation 
that occurred from 30 days of HLU. The ability of articular cartilage to recover upon a return to normal ambula-
tion and weight-bearing is unclear, with conflicting ­reports18,19. Finally, meniscal responses in female mice were 
examined in a short-term mission of 13 days in orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135)32. The findings 
of the current study will provide a characterization and quantification of the anatomic and molecular response 
of multiple knee soft tissues to reduced weight-bearing conditions, including microgravity. In combination with 
previous preclinical studies, these data further will elucidate how reduced weight-bearing serves as a hazard for 
whole knee joint health.
Results
Thinning and volumetric decline of articular cartilage after spaceflight aboard ISS (RR9). 
Mor-
phometric analyses of the cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau and the medial meniscus from the right knees 
using contrast enhanced microCT ­reconstructions16 revealed that cartilage thinning occurred specifically at the 
weight-bearing tibial-femoral cartilage contact point vs controls after ~ 35 days in orbit in FLIGHT vs. ground 
controls (GC) and vivarium controls (VIV) (− 25.4% vs GC, p = 0.00070; − 24.7% vs VIV, p = 0.0011) (Fig. 1a,b). 
Thinning was not observed at other regions throughout the tibial plateau. The volume of the articular cartilage 
was lower after FLIGHT (− 15.4% vs GC, p = 0.0033; − 15.8% vs VIV; p = 0.0024) (Fig. 1c). Importantly, no dif-
ferences were observed in cartilage thickness or volume between the baseline control group or either GC or 
VIV (Fig. 1b,c); however thickness (− 21.6%, p = 0.0072) and volume (− 15.4%, p = 0.0034) in FLIGHT mice was 
significantly lower than baseline.
Volumetric decline and reduced sulfated GAG content of the menisci after spaceflight aboard 
ISS (RR9). 
Medial meniscal volume (Fig.  2a) from FLIGHT was lower versus controls (− 9.5% vs GC, 
p < 0.00010; − 5.9% vs VIV, p = 0.0095) (Fig. 2b). Sulfated GAG content was lower after FLIGHT vs GC, though 
not significant (− 27.7% vs GC, p = 0.31; − 22.8% vs VIV, p = 0.77) (Fig. 2c).
Reduced sulfated GAG content in the menisci after spaceflight aboard the Space Shuttle 
Atlantis (STS‑135). 
Similar to the response observed in long-duration flight, sulfated GAG content in the 
pooled medial and lateral menisci after ~ 13 days of spaceflight as part of STS-135 was significantly lower vs 
GROUND control in the left knee (− 11.1% vs GC, p = 0.042), and marginally lower than GROUND control in

growing throughout the 13 day experiment.
Reduced matrix components and increased metalloproteinases within cartilage and menisci 
after spaceflight aboard ISS (RR9). 
Sulfated GAGs measured histochemically (Fig. 3a) using safranin-O 
staining were reduced within the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau (− 65.0% vs GC, p = 0.057) 
and the medial meniscus (− 60.2% vs GC, p = 0.023; − 53.8% vs VIV, p = 0.11) (Fig. 3b). The expression of the 
type II collagen-degrading MMP-13 (Fig. 3c) was elevated throughout the articular cartilage lining the medial 
tibial plateau of FLIGHT mice vs controls (+ 298% vs GC; p = 0.031, + 184% vs VIV, p = 0.067) (Fig. 3d) Likewise, 
MMP-13 was elevated in menisci from FLIGHT mice vs GC (712%, p = 0.0064). The proteoglycan-degrading 
ADAMTS5 (Fig. 3e) expression within the articular cartilage lining the tibial plateau was greater after FLIGHT 
vs controls (+ 423% vs GC, p = 0.070; + 406% vs VIV, p = 0.045) (Fig. 3f). OARSI scores that indicate the severity 
of OA, measured from histologic sections, were similar between all groups [mean(SD)]: [GC 0.19(0.26SD); VIV 
0.39(0.42); and FLIGHT 0.22(0.36)].
Proteomic analysis of menisci after spaceflight characterize arthritic responses (RR9). 
Mass 
spectroscopy identified 292 significantly altered proteins out of 2129 total proteins when comparing FLIGHT 
menisci to either GC or VIV. These 292 significant proteins were imported into an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
(IPA) software to detect altered pathways due to spaceflight by comparing between FLIGHT vs GC, FLIGHT vs 
VIV, and GC vs VIV. Hierarchical clustering of all canonical pathways detected significant responses of signal-
ing pathways in menisci of FLIGHT vs both control sets (Supplemental Fig. 1). Of those pathways, 4 of the top 
cluster and NRF2 mediated oxidative stress were selected for further assessment and further validation via West-
ern blotting, due to shared differences in protein abundance for GC and VIV vs FLIGHT (Table 1 and Fig. 4a), 
and known associations with an arthritic molecular phenotype and due to the described histologic and GAG 
results. These pathways included: mitochondrial dysfunction; altered EIF2 signaling; reduced NRF2 signaling 
(oxidative stress); lowered eIF4/p70S6K signaling; and lowered mTOR signaling (Fig. 4a). IPA assigned proteins 
with a log2 fold change (an equivalent expression log ratio) > 1.5 (+ /-) and had a p value < 0.05 were identified 
to each canonical pathway (Fig. 4a) as follows: 31 proteins in the EIF2 pathway; 21 proteins in mitochondrial 
dysfunction pathway; 22 proteins in NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response; 24 proteins in regulation of eIF4 
and p70S6K signaling; and 26 proteins in mTOR pathways were significantly different in FLIGHT vs both GC 
and VIV (Table 1).
Validation of proteomic assessment identifying arthritic responses via western blot-
ting. 
Western blotting was used to partially validate mass spectroscopy and IPA data (Supplemental Fig. 2). 
P70S6K, a downstream molecule of mTOR and AKT pathway was significantly decreased in FLIGHT group 
when compared to both GC and VIV (− 74.2% vs GC, p = 0.0053; − 69.9% vs VIV, p = 0.022) (Fig. 4b), while 
pAKT (s473) concentration was marginally lower after FLIGHT (− 61.1% vs GC, p = 0.11; − 53.9% vs VIV, 
p = 0.28) (Fig. 4b), all of which are aligned with alterations in mTOR/AKT signaling pathways. The expression of 
cleaved caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis was marginally greater after FLIGHT (+ 363% vs GC, p = 0.071; + 318% 
vs VIV, p = 0.080) (Fig. 4b).
Thinning and volumetric decline of articular cartilage and medial menisci after 30 days of 
HLU. 
Cartilage thinning occurred specifically at the weight-bearing tibial-femoral cartilage contact point vs 
controls after ~ 30 days of HLU vs GROUND (− 28.7%, p < 0.00010) (Fig. 5a,b). Thinning was not observed at 
other regions throughout the tibial plateau (Fig. 5a). The volume of the articular cartilage was also lower after 
HLU (− 17.8%, p = 0.017) (Fig. 5c). The volume of the medial meniscus was marginally lower after HLU (− 7.8%, 
p = 0.074) (Fig. 5d).
Reduced matrix components and increased metalloproteinases within cartilage and menisci 
after HLU. 
Sulfated GAGs measured histochemically by safranin-O staining (Fig. 6a) were reduced within 
both the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau (− 55.4%, p = 0.0020) and the medial meniscus 
(− 71.7%, p = 0.0016) from HLU DAY-30 vs GROUND DAY-30. The expression of the type II collagen-degrading 
MMP-13 staining was elevated throughout the medial tibial plateau of HLU DAY-30 vs GROUND DAY-30 
(+ 122%, p = 0.0047) and the medial meniscus (+ 85.0%, p = 0.065) (Fig. 6b). The expression of ADAMTS5 did 
not change after HLU compared to GROUND (Fig. 6c). OARSI scores were not significantly different between 
groups [mean(SD)]: [GROUND 0.33(0.43), and HLU 0.50(0.76)].
Recovery of articular cartilage after ground‑based HLU is dependent on exercise. 
Cartilage 
Thickness: As noted, by Day 30, cartilage thickness measured at the tibial-femoral contact point was signifi-
cantly lower in HLU mice than GROUND controls (− 28.7%, p < 0.00010) (Fig. 5a). In the GROUND mice 
that subsequently underwent exercise for Days 31–80, exercise did not affect thickness of cartilage at the tibial-
femoral cartilage contact point or promote growth (Fig. 5b). However, in mice that had been previously HLU 
but were not exercised (HLU-No Exercise), the significant thinning of cartilage remained on Day 80 relative to 
GROUND mice on Day 30 (− 34.3%%, p < 0.00010) (Fig. 5b), and also vs GROUND-No Exercise mice on Day 
80 (− 32.2%; p < 0.00010) (Fig. 5b). Moreover, marginal cartilage thinning remained in the mice that had been 
previously HLU but performed climbing exercise (HLU-Climbing) relative to GROUND on Day 30 (− 15.1%, 
p = 0.056). In contrast, running exercise 3X weekly significantly recovered cartilage thickness by Day 80 in mice

was significantly thicker than the HLU-No Exercise mice on Day 80 (+ 36.6% vs HLU-No Exercise, p < 0.00010) 
(Fig. 5b). Likewise, cartilage thickness in HLU-Climbing mice on Day 80 was greater than HLU-No Exercise 
(+ 29.3%, p = 0.0044) (Fig. 5b).
Cartilage Volume: As noted, by Day 30, cartilage volume was significantly lower in HLU mice than GROUND 
(− 17.8%, p = 0.022) (Fig. 5c). After 49 days, GROUND-Running mice had greater volume on Day 80 vs. HLU 
on Day 30 (+ 40.8% vs HLU, p < 0.00010), and was also greater vs GROUND-No Exercise and GROUND-
Climbing measured on Day 80 (+ 30.0% vs GROUND-No Exercise, p < 0.00010; + 31.6% vs GROUND-Climbing, 
p < 0.00010) (Fig. 5c). Moreover, cartilage volume from GROUND-Running mice on Day 80 was marginally 
greater than GROUND measured on Day 30 (+ 15.7%, p = 0.059). For the mice that were previously HLU, recov-
ery of cartilage volume was observed in HLU-Climbing vs HLU on Day 30 (+ 29.8%, p = 0.0010) , and also in 
from HLU-Running on Day 80 vs HLU on Day 30 (+ 41.5, p < 0.00010) (Fig. 5c). The volume of cartilage was 
greater on Day 80 in HLU-Running vs HLU-No Exercise (+ 23.5%; p = 0.0012). Finally, the volume of cartilage 
was greater on Day 80 in HLU-Running vs GROUND measured on Day 30 (+ 16.3%; p = 0.040).
Meniscal Volume: Meniscal volume was marginally lower by Day 30 after HLU (− 7.8%, p = 0.074) (Fig. 5d). 
Interestingly, meniscal volume was lower for GROUND-No Exercise and GROUND-Climbing mice at Day 80 
relative to GROUND Day 30 (− 13.4% vs GROUND-No Exercise, p < 0.00010; − 13.5% vs GROUND-Climbing, 
p < 0.00010) (Fig. 5d). Meanwhile, GROUND-Running mice exhibited significantly greater meniscal volume 
when compared to both GROUND and HLU mice on Day 30 (+ 8.3% vs GROUND, p = 0.040; + 17.4% vs HLU, 
p ≤ 0.00010), and also greater volume than all GROUND animals on Day 80 regardless of exercise (+ 25.1% vs 
GROUND-No Exercise, p < 0.00010; + 25.2% vs GROUND-Climbing, p < 0.00010) (Fig. 5d). Meniscal volume 
from all groups of mice that were previously HLU was significantly greater than the volume measured from HLU

Discussion
Reduced weight-bearing prescribed as treatment for orthopaedic conditions or as part of a sedentary lifestyle 
can lead to joint impairment and ­degradation8–15. Rodent spaceflight studies examining skeletal responses both 
on-orbit and using ground-based analogues (e.g., HLU) are good models to characterize the effects on joint 
health. While the response to spaceflight and reduced weight-bearing on bone and muscle have been well-
documented16,33–35, the effects on articular cartilage and menisci during spaceflight are poorly understood despite 
the relevance for astronaut health and performance, and as an analogue for reduced weight-bearing on the 
­ground36,37. In this study, both the articular cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau and stabilizing menisci 
within knees developed arthritic responses to periods of reduced weight-bearing during spaceflight and from 
HLU on Earth. The most important findings of this study are that: 1] cartilage degradation after both spaceflight 
for 35 days and HLU for 30 days occurs at the point of greatest tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact during 
weight-bearing in both conditions. As no differences were seen between Baseline and other controls with regard 
to thickness or volumetric changes, the differences post-flight represent change vs reduced growth; 2] cartilage

that has previously been observed to occur in female ­mice16 and male ­rats19; and, 3] recovery of cartilage vol-
ume and thickness is possible with exercise upon a return to joint loading. In the context of these findings, it 
is important to identify that rodents that are part of the rodent flight studies are active in-flight, and have been 
shown to locomote primarily with forelimbs and thus experienced highly reduced (but not abolished) weight-
bearing across hind limb ­joints22.
With regards to astronaut health and performance, maintenance of skeletal health is a critical component 
of mission success. Normal loads applied across synovial joints maintain health and performance, particularly 
with regards to the ­knee38,39. Thus, reduced weight-bearing experienced during spaceflight represents a poten-
tial challenge to synovial joint ­health4,8,10–15,19,37. The cartilage degradation observed in mice during HLU and 
spaceflight is consistent with the limited number of existing rodent studies examining cartilage health from 
simulated spaceflight ­conditions16,17,19 and in agreement with the proteoglycan loss that occurred in rodents 
during a period of spaceflight aboard ­Bion25. The loss of cartilage volume and thickness in both HLU and 
FLIGHT knees occurred with elevated matrix metalloproteinase concentration in both the articular cartilage 
and menisci. Several molecular effectors of OA were observed within the ­menisci40. The molecular arthritic 
phenotype indicating increased oxidative stress in the menisci after spaceflight involved: lower NRF2 signaling 
coincident with reduced antioxidant enzymes abundance (e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD3) and glutathione 
peroxidase (GPX4), Table 1); reduced phosphorylation of Akt and downstream anabolic signaling components 
(mTOR and p70S6K); lower protein synthesis (decreased EIF2 signaling); and increased MMP-13 expression. 
These responses may promote the volumetric loss that was observed after both spaceflight and HLU. In addition, 
IPA analysis also indicated mitochondrial dysfunction, which contributes to cartilage/meniscus cell apoptosis 
(indicated by increased cleaved caspase 3) and degradation of ­joints40,41. Mitochondrial dysfunction within 
the menisci after spaceflight is also in agreement with altered mitochondrial dysfunction and stress observed 
during and after spaceflight from multiple rodent tissues and ­astronauts24 These molecular and phenotypic 
responses in the menisci are similar in nature to the response observed in the knee and hip articular cartilage 
from female mice after 30 days of ­HLU16. Similar catabolic mechanisms and responses have also been observed 
in other in vitro and in vivo osteoarthritic models, with increased oxidative stress, reduced anabolic pathways, 
and evidence of mitochondrial ­dysfunction42–47. Clinically, circulating MMP levels that are also associated with 
collagen degradation with arthritis (e.g., MMP-3) were increased during a 21 day head-down tilt bedrest study 
as a spaceflight microgravity ­analogue48. Interestingly, several of the observed responses (e.g., reduced SOD2) are 
also characteristic of arthritic responses that occur with an abnormal excess of loading across ­joints44. However, 
OARSI scoring did not indicate pronounced degradation of the knee joint tissues, in agreement with other flights 
of similar ­duration25 suggesting early molecular changes occurring in joint tissue before histological onset of 
osteoarthritic degradation occurs. As such, the degradation and molecular responses in the articular cartilage 
and menisci could, with progression, predispose astronauts to arthrosis and later symptomatic arthritis resulting 
from the microgravity environment.
This study considered the microgravity conditions experienced aboard the ISS and space shuttle as analogues 
for the clinical scenarios of reduced weight-bearing. However, as noted, progressive joint degradation associated 
with the spaceflight environment would also act as a risk factor to human health and performance during long-
duration ­missions36, particularly when occurring with persistent bone damage that could predispose to rapid 
joint destruction and fracture upon reaching a ­destination23,33,34. Exercise regimens during spaceflight have long 
been employed as a means to preserve musculoskeletal health by increasing applied loads imparted externally 
via reaction forces or internally from muscle contractions. Long-term use of exercise modalities such as the 
Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) are utilized by US astronauts during stays in orbit aboard ISS as a 
means to protect bone and muscle ­health49. Use of the ARED alone (without bisphosphonates) has been effica-
cious at maintaining bone over the course of ISS missions of ~ 6 ­months23, though some deficits remain post-flight 
vs preflight. However, by 1 year post-flight, deficiencies in bone can exceed the magnitude observed upon return 
from ­ISS23, indicating bone damage progression occurs with a return to normal gravitational loading despite some 
preservation in flight. This progressive decline in bone mineral density and estimated strength deficits occurs in 
astronaut cohorts who performed ARED + bisphosphonate treatment in-flight23. This is concerning with regard 
to bone health upon reaching destinations during a long-duration mission (e.g., trips to Mars), as a fracture of a 
lower limb element on the planet surface would be mission critical. As Mars provides an uneven and potentially 
dangerous terrestrial environment, dynamic loads during normal locomotion or rapid egress increase this risk 
of joint soft tissue failure, particularly if the underlying and surrounding bony tissues are compromised. Pro-
gressive degradation of the menisci could result in acute failure during rapid motion, such as during egress or 
locomotion over the terrain possibly leading to meniscal tears and subsequent disability. Thinned menisci could 
further potentiate joint damage due to the abnormal shear stresses applied to underlying articular cartilage during 
such dynamic loading ­motions50–53. Thus, thinned structures that may progress toward symptomatic arthritis, 
and even in the absence of symptomatic OA as identified histologically with OARSI ­scoring16, may be sufficient 
to increase the risk of skeletal failure upon reaching a destination or during a rapid transit or egress motion.
A primary clinical concern involving reduced weight-bearing after an orthopaedic injury or from sedentary 
lifestyle is that the subsequent joint degradation may not be recoverable and may become permanent. Cartilage 
has limited repair ­capacity14, and consideration must be given regarding the differences between mouse and 
human articular cartilage repair capacity. Human articular cartilage is divided into multiple zones (superficial, 
middle, and deep zones). These zones vary in matrix biochemical composition, cell density and morphology. 
Superficial chondrocytes are known to have proliferative capacity compared to middle and deep zone chondro-
cytes. Presence of tidemark hinders the vascularization of articular cartilage which restricts its healing/repair 
process upon ­injury54. Mouse joints are small with thin cartilage, which consists of only a few cell layers and 
the presence of open growth plates through advancing age likely increase intrinsic healing ­potential55. However, 
as noted, periods of reduced weight-bearing or HLU have been found to induce cartilage damage in humans,

rodents, and ­dogs9,13,56,57. The current study reaffirms those findings, demonstrating the area of greatest cartilage 
decrease is at the point of greatest tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact. Conversely, it also revealed that spe-
cific joint-loading exercises have the potential to reduce and recover cartilage damage after a period of reduced 
weight-bearing, suggesting these exercises have utility in attenuating arthritic responses in human joints as 
well. As previously noted, astronauts in spaceflight who perform ARED are able to maintain bone health during 
spaceflight to lessen the degree of degradation upon return to normal ­loading23, strengthening the association that 
these tested exercises confer some joint protection and recovery. In clinical patients with weight-bearing restric-
tions or a sedentary lifestyle, a prescribed exercise routine may be an effective way to preserve joint function and 
reduce the degradation of the cartilage and menisci. Elucidating the clinical response to specific exercise in a 
reduced weight-bearing scenario may help identify a possible therapeutic pharmacological target, and requires 
further research. Based upon the results of the present study, running on flat surfaces may be superior to climb-
ing stairs after a period of reduced loading to assist in joint recovery and mitigating arthritic responses, though 
there may be other exercises that are better suited to slowing joint degradation that have not yet been tested. The 
increased contact loads experienced with running may provide such benefit. However, this study exemplifies 
the similarities in joint degradation between microgravity experienced during spaceflight and clinical reduced 
weight-bearing conditions on the ground, and highlights the possibility of joint recovery in both scenarios with 
appropriately prescribed exercise.
This study is not without limitations. The first considers HLU as an analogue for FLIGHT. Both conditions 
experience reduced weight-bearing on the hind limb, though the process of HLU could result in a greater degree 
of decreased loading vs FLIGHT, in which mice are ­active22. However, it should be noted that gross loss of carti-
lage was observed from FLIGHT and HLU mice in similar spatial locations vs each other and relative to multiple 
controls, and also relative to previous work using older, female mice of the same stain that experienced HLU for 
30 ­days16. Thus these models appear appropriate based on the outcomes presented. Our previous ­study19 simulat-
ing spaceflight conditions (e.g., low dose radiation + / − reduced weight-bearing via HLU) responses in the knees 
of rats utilized more advanced imaging modalities (e.g., 7 T(T) MRI) that provided both morphologic changes 
and insight into incipient molecular deficits, such as collagen network disruption. While contrast-enhanced 
CT scans utilized for this study provided the ability to spatially localize deficits across the knees of the smaller 
mouse model and compare results with our previous HLU + / − radiation mouse ­study16, it cannot provide those 
molecular correlates. Moreover, for the HLU study, tissues were harvested upon removal from HLU, while for 
flight tissues were harvested ~ 24 h post-recovery. This unavoidable delay in returning live animals could affect 
gene expression patterns for multiple proteins and affect metabolism in several ways; however, it is unlikely this 
period of loading would affect the gross morphology of the cartilage and/or the menisci. Future missions may 
likely return live animals near the Kennedy Space Center, and will reduce recovery time.
In conclusion, reduced weight-bearing from either spaceflight or HLU induced an arthritic phenotype with 
degradation of knee articular cartilage and menisci in male mice. Cartilage loss occurred specifically at the 
region of greatest weight-bearing and tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact (and thus presumably the loca-
tion that experiences the greatest reduction of applied loads in the experimental conditions), which is consistent 
with findings from female mice after 30 days of ­HLU16. Furthermore, exercise after a period of joint unloading 
reduced cartilage degradation and improved thickness. As an analogue for reduced weight-bearing in clinical 
scenarios, these results suggest that prescribed exercise programs may alleviate and recover articular cartilage 
damage. Exploring the utilization of these exercises for joint recovery in patients with prescribed reduced weight-
bearing, who have a sedentary lifestyle, or most directly during and/or after spaceflight and, may lead to a better 
understanding of the chondro-protective effects of exercise.
Methods
Three sets of animal studies were performed: two involving spaceflight, and another with a ground-based, reduced 
weight-bearing microgravity analogue. The study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.
Rodent research‑9 (RR9). 
All experiments were approved by the NASA Ames Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee (IACUC), Kennedy Space Center IACUC, and the Loma Linda Medical Center IACUC, and 
conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 
USA). Male C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were sent to the ISS as part of the Rodent Research 
(RR)-9 mission in August 2017, spending ~ 35 days in microgravity. The RR9 experiment was launched as part

Rodent Habitats aboard the ISS. Individual animal randomization was avoided to prevent complications related 
to potential altered hierarchical structure within cages; instead groups were determined by finding the mean 
mass of mouse per cage so that each group consisted of cages that each had similar body masses. Nine-week old 
male mice were separated into the following groups: 1] mice to be launched to the ISS (FLIGHT; n = 20) that 
are housed on-orbit within specialized Rodent Habitats that provide food and water to mice during their stay in 
orbit while filtering the air; 2] ground-based habitat controls (Ground Control, GC; n = 20) placed inside identi-
cal Rodent Habitats as FLIGHT, which was placed inside an environmental chamber that can mimic the envi-
ronmental conditions experienced by the FLIGHT animals over the course of the mission based on recordings 
over time (e.g., temperature, humidity, and ­CO2 partial pressure), as well as have access to the same NASA Type 
12 Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bars, or; 3] standard vivarium controls housed within the animal facility in 
standard rodent housing (Vivarium, VIV; n = 20). The day prior to launch, the FLIGHT groups were loaded into 
a transporter, with both groups within their respective cage and isolated with a separator in the transporter (to 
prevent aggression), and then loaded into the Dragon SpaceX Capsule. Mice were then transferred into Rodent 
Habitats aboard the ISS, n = 10 per habitat. The day after launch, a set of mice from the same cohort sent from 
Jackson Labs as the FLIGHT, GC, and VIV groups were sacrificed as a basal control, and tissues were harvested 
(Baseline; n = 20). Total time aboard the ISS was 34 days. Unbearthing from ISS and splashdown of live mice 
occurred ~ 35 days after launch, and live mice were collected by the science teams for behavioral and functional 
testing at Loma Linda Medical Center, immediately followed by euthanization and tissue harvest. A natural 
disaster (Hurricane Irma) caused dissections of the FLIGHT group (performed Aug-Sept 2017), to differ in time 
from the two ground controls (May–June, 2018).
Hind limb unloading and Readaptation to weight‑bearing with/without exercise. 
All experi-
ments were approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine IACUC. Eighty male C57BL/6 mice were purchased 
to perform a ground-based analogue (hind limb unloading; HLU) for the RR9 spaceflight experiment. The study 
was originally powered based on cartilage thinning data presented by Moriyama et al18, which measured carti-
lage thinning in rodents after 4 weeks of immobilization using histological techniques.. Mice arrived at 9 weeks 
of age, and were housed under a 12:12 h light–dark cycle at 26 °C during a 1 week acclimation period. Ten-week-
old, male C57BL/6 mice were then randomly grouped, and either HLU via tail suspension for 30 days (n = 40), 
or remained weight-bearing (GROUND; n = 40), per our standard protocol. On Day 30, HLU and GROUND 
mice (n = 10/group) were sacrificed and tissues were collected. Remaining HLU mice were removed from tail 
suspension to be full weight-bearing, and then all mice (both GROUND and HLU) were enrolled into one of 3 
exercise groups (n = 20 per group) from Days 31–80: i] no exercise; ii] climbing exercise performed 3X weekly, 
with mice running up a custom tube attached to enclosed housing units at both ends (1 m in length X ~ 5 cm 
diameter), in which the angle was increased bi-weekly from a starting orientation at of 60° from horizontal until 
the tube was 90°, and investigators ensuring each mouse performed 3 climbs per session, or; iii] running exercise 
on a treadmill, performed 3X weekly at a speed of 17 cm/s, with 30 min of monitored exercise performed per 
session. As such, we generated 6 experimental groups in order to examine how a return to weight-bearing with/
without exercise could affect joint health after a 30-day reduced weight-bearing period, including GROUND-No 
exercise; GROUND-Climbing; GROUND-Running; HLU-No exercise; HLU-Climbing; and HLU-Running. The 
remaining mice were euthanized and their tissues were harvested at Day 80.
HLU procedure: All mice (both HLU and Control) were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2% isoflurane, 
95% oxygen). Mice enrolled in the HLU groups were both socially housed (n = 2/cage permitting contact) and 
tail suspended per our standard ­procedure16. Briefly, the HLU animal’s tail was cleaned with 70% alcohol, and 
treated with Benzoin tincture in order to help with adherence of tape. Traction tape (3 M HealthCare, Two Har-
bors, MN) was adhered to the tail in a braided manner, and the free ends of the tape were attached to a fish-hook 
swivel. The swivel was connected to repair clamp, with the barrel treated with Teflon lubricant to help ensure 
smooth motion across a steel rod running the length of the cage. A 30° angle of the thorax relative to the floor 
was ensured. Free access to water and nutrition was available to the animals ad libitum.
Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS‑135). 
7-week old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) 
were shipped to KSC. At 9 weeks of age, the mice were either grouped as FLIGHT and placed into specialized 
Animal Enclosure Modules (analogous to Rodent Habitats sent to ISS) to be launched aboard the Space Shuttle 
Atlantis (STS-135), or served as GROUND controls at KSC, which were housed at similar environmental condi-
tions (temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide) as in the AEMs on orbit. Mice were skeletally growing at the 
­outset58. After 13 days, live mice were returned from orbit, and fresh tissues were harvested within 5 h of landing. 
The study was part of the NASA Ames Research Center Biospecimen Sharing Program; analyses were performed 
on tissues collected from n = 15 mice /group. Due to the multiple tissues isolated by one investigator from each 
limb (e.g., removal and storage of multiple muscles and disarticulation of bones prior to meniscal isolation) dur-
ing the time-limited process dissection process, in some instances menisci were torn and incomplete. As such, 
GAG content was only measured from pooled samples involving two whole menisci, involving 8–14 paired sam-
ples/group. All procedures were approved by the IACUC at the University of Colorado at Boulder, KSC, NASA 
Ames research center, and Amgen Corporation.
Tissue harvest and storage. 
RR9 and HLU studies: The intact right hind limb was carefully removed 
preserving the synovial joint of the knee and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (n = 10/group). After 3 days, 
the hind limbs were transferred to 70% ethanol for imaging and histologic analyses. The lateral and medial 
menisci were extracted from the left hind limb (RR9—n = 20 pairs/group; HLU—n = 7–8 pairs/group; several 
partial menisci were collected and thus not analyzed) and stored at − 80 °C for both liquid chromatography-mass

spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis and dimethylmethylene colorimetric assay to measure sulfated GAGs. STS-
135 study: Menisci were isolated from the knees of the mice within 3–5 h post-flight to KSC. Menisci were snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C for GAG analysis.
Contrast‑enhanced microcomputed tomography. 
The right hind limb was immersed in 1% w/v 
phosphotungstic acid in 70% ethanol 24-h prior to analysis using microcomputed tomography (microCT80, 
Scanco Medical AG; Bassersdorf, Switzerland),with isotropic voxels of 10 μm/side, at 70 kV and an intensity of 
114 μ A. Knees were scanned while still in phosphotungstic acid. Later, the knees were placed into 70% ethanol 
for histology.
Image processing and analysis. 
The resulting microCT data were imported into Mimics Innovation 
Suite (v.18.0 × 64) and reoriented to maintain similar relative direction between samples in order to measure 
the structure of both the articular cartilage and meniscus. Reconstructions and analysis were performed as 
previously ­described16. For normalization, a rectangular region of 250,000 µm2 was sectioned for the articu-
lar cartilage lining the medial tibial plateau. Each sample included the spatial location for the tibial-femoral 
cartilage-cartilage contact point as the reference. This region was defined as the central area of the medial tibial 
plateau, with minimal coverage from the overlying ­meniscus59. The resulting 3D reconstructed area from this 
region of interest of the articular cartilage, and the whole medial meniscus, were analyzed. The newly sectioned 
medial tibial articular cartilage was measured for thickness at 5 locations, including: the femoral-tibial cartilage-
cartilage contact point, and at a 250 µm displacement that was lateral, medial, anterior and posterior direction 
from the contact point. Specifically, we measured the volume of cartilage for the entire medial tibial plateau, as 
well as the thickness at these named regions for comparison across groups as metrics for degradation. In some 
instances, contrast enhancing agent infiltration within the intact knee joint was insufficient in order to assure 
robust measures could be made, and as such those images were excluded.
Histology and molecular probing. 
After microCT imaging, the right knees were decalcified in Immuno-
cal (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) and embedded in paraffin for sectioning, as previously ­described16. 5 µm 
thick coronal sections were analyzed from n = 7–10 samples per group. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E; Meyer’s hematoxylin & Eosin; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and safranin-O (0.1% Safranin O; 0.05% 
Fast Green Solution; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) staining for semi-quantitative analysis of glycosaminogly-
cans (GAGs). The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring ­system60 was used to evaluate 
arthritis severity by a blinded expert in murine osteoarthritis. Immunostaining identified expression of matrix 
metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13; 1:500; Rabbit Polycolonal IgG; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) presence and ADAM 
Metallopeptidase with Thrombospondin Type 1 Motif 5 (ADAMTS5; 1:50; Rabbit Polycolonal IgG; Abcam, 
Cambridge, MA). Quantification of MMP-13 and ADAMTS5 within the articular cartilage and medial meniscus 
was performed to measure the ratio of peri-cellular positive-to-negative reactivity, throughout the whole tibial 
plateau and medial meniscus. Histologic evaluation was performed using BIOQUANT OSTEO v.17 (Bioquant 
Image Analysis Corporation, Nashville, TN). The abundance of these proteins within the articular cartilage and 
menisci were compared between groups as a metric to characterize an arthritic phenotype.
Proteomics and pathway analysis. 
The menisci were processed for proteomic analysis (n = 10 pairs/
group), using the techniques and resources of the Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource at the Wake 
Forest School of Medicine and similar to our previous analysis of mouse femoral head ­cartilage16. Two of the 12 
samples (paired menisci) per group collected for analysis were excluded as they were determined to be contami-
nated with muscle during the dissection process. Briefly, frozen menisci were homogenized in radioimmuno-
precipitation (RIPA) buffer containing protease inhibitor and homogenized. Centrifuged supernatant (18,000 g) 
was subjected to reducing alkylation in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol and 30 mM iodoacetamide. The 
protein concentration was measured after centrifugation (14,000 g) and resuspension in 50 mM ammonium 
bicarbonate; 5 µg of protein per sample was proteolytically digested using 0.1 µg of sequencing-grade modi-
fied trypsin and overnight incubation at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were purified using a C18 desalting spin 
column, dried and resuspended in water containing 5% (v/v) acetonitrile and 1% (v/v) formic acid for LC–MS/
MS analysis.
Samples were analyzed by LC–MS/MS system using a Thermo Orbitrap Velos Pro Mass Spectrometer (Thermo 
Scientific, Waltham, MA) and a Dionex Ultimate-3000 nano-UPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). 
An Acclaim PepMap 100 (C18, 5 μm, 100 Å, 100 μm × 2 cm) trap column and an Acclaim PepMap RSLC (C18, 
2 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm × 50 cm) analytical column were employed for peptide separation. Spectra were acquired 
by data dependent scans consisting of MS/MS scans of the ten most intense ions from the full MS scan with 
dynamic exclusion option for 30 s enabled. The spectra were searched using Sequest HT algorithm within the 
Proteome Discoverer v2.2 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) in combination with the UniProt mouse protein 
FASTA database (annotated 16,747 entries, December 2015). Label free relative quantification (LFQ) was based 
on the total peak areas of identified peptides normalized to the total ion current (TIC). Search parameters were 
as follow: FT-trap instrument, parent mass error tolerance of 10 ppm, fragment mass error tolerance of 0.6 Da 
(monoisotopic), variable modifications of 16 Da (oxidation) on methionine and fixed modification of 57 Da 
(carbamidomethylation) on cysteine. Further Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) mapped the proteins identified 
by MS analysis to canonical pathways, diseases and biological functions. The canonical pathway outputs were then 
further examined for interactions within the pathways causing potential diseases. The results were validated with 
Western blot analysis for associated proteins to further indicate responses characterizing an arthritic phenotype. 
Western blotting was performed using the following antibodies: p-AKT (Ser 473) 0.5 ug/ml (R&D systems, Inc.,

The sulfated (s)GAG quantity was measured in the pooled medial and 
lateral menisci of the left knee from the RR9 groups (n = 8), and from the pooled medial and lateral menisci 
from individual left and right knees (measured separately) from the STS-135 groups (n = 8–14/group). Menisci 
were digested with a papain solution containing: 125 ug/ml papain, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM 
L-cysteine-HCl and heated at 60 °C overnight (Sigma-Aldrich). Sulfate GAG content from digests were meas-
ured using the dimethylmethylene blue colorimetric assay. A mixture of 180 ul of dimethymethylene blue was 
added to 20 ul of each sample, with a chondroitin sulfate standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Absorbance 
was set at 525 nm. sGAG content was normalized to total protein from a Bicinchoninic acid assay for RR9 groups 
(BCA, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), or normalized to DNA content for STS-135 groups (PicoGreen double-
stranded DNA assay reagent, Invitrogen). GAG contents were compared between groups to characterize an 
arthritic phenotype. As noted, exclusion of samples was based on availability of intact pairs of menisci isolated 
during dissections.
Statistical analysis. 
Statistics were performed by the investigative team and analyzed using GraphPad 
Prism 8 (San Diego, CA). To determine effects caused by microgravity, data from the RR9 mission were ana-
lyzed using one-way ANOVA comparing flight animals vs GC, VIV, and baseline when examined. Moreover, 
one-way ANOVA was performed the ground-based microgravity analogue HLU vs GROUND study. Unpaired 
t-test were used for STS-135 data. Data in text is presented as p value for the post hoc test following a significant 
ANOVA result, or the t test; when ANOVAs were appropriate and assumptions of a normal distribution and 
variance were confirmed were appropriate and assumptions of a normal distribution and variance were con-
firmed, Bonferroni’s post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons between all groups were performed and results are 
presented in figures; for all α ≤ 0.05. The statistical analysis utilized with IPA for comparing canonical pathway 
changes and proteins between groups were calculated using a Right-Tailed Fisher’s Exact Test with α ≤ 0.05.
