The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceﬂight on mammals,
inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy.
Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota
interactions during spaceﬂight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host
gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceﬂight using multiomics.
Metagenomics revealed signiﬁcant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in
bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis.
Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular
matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding
changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that
interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceﬂight pathology and that these
interactions might critically inﬂuence human health and long-duration spaceﬂight feasibility.
The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27
of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to
MarsintheGlobalExplorationRoadmap1,2,andsustainablelong-termlunar
exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this
ambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of the
imminentcommerciallowEarthorbit(LEO)destinationsand Gateway,and
the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early
2030 s3. Major challenges associated to longer duration spaceﬂight and
habitation off-Earth are identiﬁed in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4,
including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the
Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions.
Consistently observed spaceﬂight-associated pathologies, notably dis-
rupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipid
metabolism dysregulation, pose signiﬁcant risks to astronaut health5,6.
Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated
microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre
characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased
insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes7. In mice, a
reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity
simulation using hindlimb unloading8. This is reﬂected in the muscle
transcriptome after spaceﬂight, where insulin receptor signalling is sug-
gestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9.
Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10 and
mesenchymal stem11 cell cultures increases production of fatty acids and
complex lipids. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid
metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity,
with RNAi knockdown of sbp-1 and mdt-15 reducing lipid toxicity12.
Spaceﬂight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605,
690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))13–15 characterised rats as hyperlipidemic,
with spaceﬂight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and sub-
stantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, sugges-
tive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently
observed mammalian response to spaceﬂight alongside aligned disruption
of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis16–20. These observations in
mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic
proteins which drive lipid metabolism, signiﬁcant increases in steatosis,
cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids.
The immune system can be compromised by spaceﬂight, both in space
and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before ﬂight, infection with
inﬂuenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been observed in astronauts21.
Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeﬁciency upon returning to
Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests
through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer
celland macrophage function24,25.Theunderlyingcause of thesechanges are
thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with
spaceﬂight26, as well asshiftsin the gut microbiome27. On Earth, comparable
changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism,
immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut

microbiota28–32. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology
arises from long-duration conﬁnement, reshaping the bidirectional
exchangesbetweenusuallydiverseenvironmentalmicrobialecosystemsand
the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity33–37.
Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in spaceﬂight
pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic
function on Earth, there has been increasing research into gut microbiome
dynamics associated withspaceﬂight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S
rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38 identiﬁed signiﬁcant changes in
the relative abundance of 16OTUs in the gutmicrobiome of mice inRodent
Research (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as within
the genera Staphylococcus and Tyzzerella, and were lower in mice after
spaceﬂight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al.39
explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice ﬂown in the RR-5 mission
using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole meta-
genome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identiﬁed 14 ASVs as dif-
ferent in relative abundance (p <0.1) between spaceﬂight (ISS) and ground
controls after 9 weeks of spaceﬂight, including increases in the genera
Clostridium, Romboutsia, Ruminiclostridium, and Shuttleworthia, and
decreases in Hungatella, while WMS identiﬁed signiﬁcant enrichment of
Dorea sp. and the species Lactobacillus murinus.
In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de
novo co-assembled WMS were employed to capture metagenomic changes
in the murine gut microbiome associated with spaceﬂight across multiple
samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig. 1). Intestinal and hepatic tran-
scriptomicswerethenusedtoassesstheassociatedgeneexpressionresponse

Results
Spaceﬂight increased total body weight
Four treatment groups from a single cohort of 32 weeks-old female mice
included two spaceﬂight groups ﬂown to the ISS on SpaceX-13: FLT_LAR,
returned to Earth after 29 days of spaceﬂight as part of the Live Animal
Return mission, and FLT_ISS, sampled on the ISS by the crew after 56 days
ofspaceﬂight.TwocontrolgroupsincludedGC_LARandGC_ISS,rearedin
identical habitats at the Kennedy Space Centre and sampled after 29 and
56 days of the mission, respectively. Although reduced muscle mass and
bone density in astronauts and mice during spaceﬂight are commonly
observed40,41, in this study, total mouse body weight was trending to increase
after 29 days of spaceﬂight in Live Animal Return mice (FLT_LAR; n = 9)
and signiﬁcantly increased after56 days of spaceﬂight in ISS mice (FLT_ISS;
n = 7, p <0.05). Carcass mass did not differ signiﬁcantly (t-test, p > 0.05)
between Ground Control Live Animal Return (GC_LAR; n = 7) and
FLT_LAR mice, which weighed 28.9 g−1 (±1.6) and 30.1 g−1 (±1.4),
respectively, but did signiﬁcantly (t-test, p <0.05) increase from 28.4 g−1

FLT_ISS mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). Suzuki et al.42 observed similar
increasesinthemousehabitatunit3missionandattributedthesechangesto
substantial increases in both white and brown adipose tissue, and large
increases in total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. While healthy
adipose cells play an important role in maintaining insulin sensitivity,
dysregulated adipose can lead to production of pro-inﬂammatory and
insulin-antagonistic molecules43,44.
Spaceﬂight alters murine gut microbiota
Insulin resistance and lipid accumulation are common spaceﬂight
phenotypes45 which are inﬂuenced by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
and can be improved through butyrate dietary interventions in
ground-based murine studies46,47. As butyrate and other SCFAs are
predominantly produced by bacteria within the gut48, alterations in
RR6 gut microbiome composition were explored. Characterisation of
microbiota used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as WMS
sequencing from faecal samples collected from GC_LAR and
FLT_LAR (after 29 days of spaceﬂight) as well as GC_ISS and FLT_ISS
mice (after 56 days of spaceﬂight).
Sequencing of amplicon libraries generated 2,146,311 sequences after
quality control, with an average of 77,015 ± 853 per sample (Fig. 2A–E;
Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). A total of 133 exact sequence variants
(ESVs) were inferred across all samples; these ESVs accounted for 1,959,722
(91.32%) of reads. Thirty-ﬁve ESVs were annotated as putative bacterial
species, 12 at genera level and 11 at family level, with an average of > 99.9%
nucleotide identity, while 74 ESVs were dissimilar to any well-characterised
taxa (<99% nucleotide identity; 14 of which were ﬂagged as putative
chimeras). Most counts (73.1%) were captured by ESVs annotated as
putative species, 24 of these could be assigned to a single species and 11 to
multiple species which share identical rRNA gene sequences at the V4
region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Bacterial species putatively identiﬁed across
all mice using amplicons belonged to the phyla Firmicutes (28), Proteo-
bacteria (4), Actinobacteria (1), Deferribacteres (1) and Bacteroidetes (1).
Parabacteroides goldsteinii had the highest relative abundance throughout
the samples and accounted for 53.7% of sequence counts.
WMS of faecal DNA generated 277,294,078 reads after quality
control, with an average of 8,665,440 ± 1,423,541 per sample (Fig. 2F–I;
Supplementary Fig. 4 and Data 2). Co-assembly across all 32 mice
generated 219,259 contigs and back-mapping captured 85.1% of raw
counts after ﬁltering out reads using the mouse genome (154,692,460
counts). This included 22,318 contigs which could be provisionally
annotated (>90% nucleotide identity) from 175 species and shared an
average of 99.1% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with known species
or strains (and capturing 84.5% of total counts) (Fig. 2G, H). After
sparsity (>90% counts in a single sample) and minimum sample (<3)
occurrence ﬁltering to allow statistical detection of spaceﬂight associated
differences across biological replicates, 45,890 contigs remained which
captured 154,238,826 counts. These contigs were provisionally anno-
tated as putative bacteria (50.6%), viruses (0.9%) and metazoa (3.0%), or
were unknown (45.4%). Grouping WMS contigs by species annotation
and ﬁltering for high conﬁdence (>97% ANI, and > 3000 nt total length)
identiﬁed 97 putative species representing 81 bacterial species within
Firmicutes, and 7 Proteobacteria, 4 Actinobacteria, 1 Bacteroidetes, and
1 Deferribacteres, as well as the helminths, Trichinella nativa and Tri-
chinella pseudospiralis (Supplementary Data 3). These species groups
ranged from 2–2734 contigs, with an average total alignment length
of > 880,000 nt and an ANI of 98.8%. Prevalent taxa included P. gold-
stienii representing 73.1%, Enterocloster clostridioformis representing
1.47% and all other species representing below 1% of relative abundance
across all mice, including non-bacterial species such as T. nativa,
representing 0.03% of relative abundance and present in all mice. P.
goldsteinii is a ubiquitous commensal gut microbiome inhabitant in
mice, and the species includes strains that play a role in reducing
intestinal
inﬂammation
and
maintaining
intestinal
epithelial
integrity49,50.
Microbial alpha diversity indices did not signiﬁcantly differ between
mice groups using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing or WMS data (Fig. 2D;
Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). Canonical Analysis of Principal
Coordinates showed both FLT_ISS and GC_ISS as well as FLT_LAR and
GC_LAR samples segregated by group, and the ﬁrst axes explained 25.46%
and 17.63% of variation using 16 S rRNA gene ampliﬁcation and 19.41%
and 11.49% of variation using WMS, respectively. ANOVA-like permuta-
tion tests conﬁrmed signiﬁcant variation between groups under constraint
forbothampliconandWMSdata(Fig.2E,I;p <0.05;SupplementaryFigs.2,
3), suggesting spaceﬂight inﬂuenced gut microbiota in both comparisons
regardless of the metagenomic approach taken.
Signiﬁcant spaceﬂight microbiome changes are associated with
short-chain fatty acid metabolism, bile acid conversion and
pathogenicity
Differential abundance analysis of amplicon data identiﬁed 45 ESVs that
were signiﬁcantly different in relative abundance between spaceﬂight and
ground control mice, including 34 ESVs between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR
and 18 ESVs between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3A, B; av p-value = 0.004,
av padj = 0.02, Supplementary Figs. 5, 6, Data 1). Although there were
divergent changes in the relative abundance of H. xylanolytica, the common
signiﬁcant enrichment of E. muris and D. welbionis in mice after 29 and
56 days of spaceﬂight, compared to separate matched control groups, sug-
gests spaceﬂight had some common inﬂuence of gut microbiota which
persisted overthe29–56 daysonboard theISSaswellassomedistincteffects
over time.
Differential abundance analysis of WMS identiﬁed 13,996 contigs
that were signiﬁcantly different (DESeq2 FDR <0.1) in relative abun-
dance between spaceﬂight and ground control mice, including 11,087
between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 3,997 between GC_ISS and
FLT_ISS (Fig. 3C–H). From these, 35 putative species (99.0% ANI;
Supplementary Note, Data 3) identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly differentially
abundant between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (Fig. 3I) with an average
total length of 390,616nt per species, while 34 species (99.0% ANI)
signiﬁcantly differed between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3J) with an
average total length of 180,554 nt.
D. welbionis was recently characterised by Roy et al.51,52 as a butyrate
producer likely present in the gut of most humans and was negatively
correlated with BMI in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. The
same team used murine supplementation experiments to illustrate that D.
welbionis could partially counteract insulin resistance, adipose tissue
hypertrophy and inﬂammation as well as suggest a potential association
with mitochondrial content and activity in adipose tissue after high fat diet

ulating genes, such as Per2 and Bmal1, in a bidirectional interaction which

spaceﬂight mice (Fig. 3A, B, I, J) compared to their respective ground
controls here is therefore noteworthy given the high lipid accumulation,
liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed in
rodent research missions and astronauts17,18,45. Whether the relative increase
of this species might be counteracting or contributing towards spaceﬂight
pathology is unclear and merits further study. Conversely, other butyrate
producers, such as Intestinimonas butyriciproducens54, were depleted after
29 days of spaceﬂight.
L. murinus and Acutalibacter muris were depleted in mice during
spaceﬂight (Fig. 3A, I), as well as some Enterocloster species after
29 days of spaceﬂight, which can have high expression of bile salt
hydrolases (BSHs), able to deconjugate bile salts into less toxic bile
acids, and can promote microbially mediated 7α-dehydroxylation of
host primary bile acids into secondary bile acids55–59. Conversion of
the major human primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid (CA) and
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), to the secondary BAs deoxycholic
acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), is mediated by a limited
number of closely related clostridia containing the bile acid inducible

reduced in abundance after spaceﬂight (Fig. 3I, J). The major murine
primary bile acids also include α- and β-muricholic acid (αMCA and
βMCA), which are transformed by 7α-dehydroxylation to mur-
ideoxycholic acid (MDCA).
E. muris, which signiﬁcantly increased in both spaceﬂight groups of
mice compared to ground controls (Fig. 3A, B, I, J), has been recently
characterised as 7α-dehydroxylating in mice62, containing the bile acid
inducible operons BaiBCDEFGI and BaiJKL, and BaiA, homologous to
Clostridium scindens. The Bai operon enables E. muris and C. scindens to

increase concentrations of 7α-dehydroxylated secondary BAs that alter the
host bile acid pool and act as ligands to bile acid receptors to inﬂuence host
inﬂammation, glucose and lipid metabolism62–66. For example, bile sensor
farnesoid-X-receptor(FXR)modulatesenterohepaticrecirculationandhost
cholesterol metabolism through bile acid regulation of cyp7A166. Similarly,
secondary bile acids such as DCA and LCA are potent agonists of the bile

β-dehydroxylation mediated by microbes such as E.muris can modify
MCAs after epimerization into HDCA72, and critically regulate lipid
metabolism73,74. Interestingly, E. clostridioformis, signiﬁcantly higher in
relative abundance after both 29 and 56 days of spaceﬂight (Fig. 3), is
reported as increasing in the presence of E. muris62 and harbours 7α/β
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH)59,75, which can also transform
primary and secondary BAs into oxo-bile acids64. This agrees with ﬁndings
fromtheRR-5mission39,whichfoundsigniﬁcantlyincreasedlevelsofserum
choline in mice after spaceﬂight, suggesting a broad impact on lipid
metabolism.
Immune suppression has previously been described as a response to
spaceﬁght76 and could result as bile acid dysregulation77,78. So increased
relative abundance of C. difﬁcile after both29 and 56 days of spaceﬂight is of
potential concern if toxigenic.
Changes in spaceﬂight associated metagenome functional
prediction
Metagenomic functional prediction identiﬁed 4,583,759 genes in the co-
assembly generated from all 32 mice, 392,631 of which were annotated by
Kegg database (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, a high proportion (91.4%)
of genes, including differentially abundant genes, remain unannotated.
Kegg annotated genes included the pathogenicity locus (including
tcdAB) from C. difﬁcile, suggesting signiﬁcant enrichment of the species
after 29 and 56 days (Fig. 3I, J) could include a toxigenic strain. Bile acid
metabolism genes were identiﬁed, including 17 bile salt hydrolases,
including that from spaceﬂight enriched A. muris (Cbh), and 57 non-
redundant Bai genes, including from C. scindens (BaiABCDEFGI) and I.
butyriciproducens (BaiA and BaiCD), species which were signiﬁcantly
depleted after spaceﬂight as well as A. muris (BaiCD), Eisenbergiella
massiliensis (BaiA) and Blautia pseudococcoides (BaiCD), species which
were signiﬁcantly enriched after spaceﬂight (Supplementary Data
2 and 3). E. aldenensis and S. arabinosiphila both contained the impor-
tant BaiCD gene and were signiﬁcantly enriched in mice after 29 days of
spaceﬂight but signiﬁcantly depleted after 56 days. Alongside signiﬁcant
enrichment of the rare 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris, these shifts suggest
dynamic changes in secondary bile acid production and potential
inﬂuence on the composition of the host bile acid pool56,79.
Differential abundance analysis inferred 52,370 genes were sig-
niﬁcantly different (FDR <0.1) in abundance after 29 days and 37,068 genes
after 56 days of spaceﬂight, which could be assigned to 2,811 and 2,572
unique KEGG ontology terms, respectively (Fig. 4A). Over-representation
analysis identiﬁed signiﬁcant (FDR <0.1) increases in pathways of interest
related to fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, antimicrobial resis-
tance and potential host interactions (ECM, carbohydrates and patho-
genicity), after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceﬂight compared to ground
controls (Fig. 4B, C; Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these sig-
niﬁcant changes in metagenomic gene inventories, and speciﬁc bacterial
species with well-characterised functions, due to spaceﬂight suggest gut
microbiome changes which should inﬂuence lipid and bile acid homo-
eostasis, and the immune system of the murine host.
Spaceﬂight alters host intestinal gene expression
Faecal or serum fatty acid or bile acid concentrations were not measured
within the Rodent Research 6 mission; however, host colon and liver gene
expression were assessed from all four groups of mice, allowing host
responses to spaceﬂight at the host-gut microbiome interface to be
investigated.
Host intestinal gene expression revealed extensive signiﬁcant
(FDR <0.1)changesafter29 daysand56 daysofspaceﬂightwhencompared
to ground controls, including 4613 differentially expressed (DE) genes
between GC_LARand FLT_LAR, and 4,476DEgenesbetweenGC_ISSand
FLT_ISS (Fig. 5A–H; Supplementary Figs. 7, 8 and Data 5). Of these, 43%
and 44% were increased due to ﬂight in LAR and ISS mice, respectively.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a
pathway level after 29 days and 56 days of spaceﬂight (Fig. 5I, J), including
immune suppression, dysregulation off cholesterol and bile acid, and
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling.

in ground controls) as well as depletion of C. scindens, suggests sec-
ondary bile acid production and the bile acid pool is likely altered in the
murine gut during spaceﬂight. In the host intestine, bile acids are
passively absorbed or actively taken up through the apical membrane
by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, ASBT (Slc10A2),
bound to the cytosolic ileal bile acid binding protein, IBABP (Fabp6),

xylanolytica, while depleted species included Intestinimonas butyriciproducens and
ESVs ambiguous to multiple Enterocloster species (including E.lavalensis) and
Ligilactobacillus species (including L.murinus). Species enriched in FLT_ISS mice
included D.welbionis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Enterocloster clostridioformis,
E.muris, Guopingia tenuis, Romboutsia ilealis and Romboutsia timonensis, while
depleted species included H.xylanolytica. WMS: Microbiome species signiﬁcantly
enriched in after 29 days of spaceﬂight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including Blautia
pseudococcoides, Clostridioides difﬁcile, C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis,
E.clostridioformis, E.muris, G.tenuis, Hungatella hathewayi, Ruthenibacterium lac-
tatiformans, Schaedlerella arabinosiphila and the proteobacteria Delftia lacustris.
Signiﬁcantly depleted species included 20 ﬁrmicutes, including Acutalibacter muris,
Anaerostipes caccae, Blautia wexlerae, Clostridium scindens, Enterococcus faecalis,
Ligilactobacillus murinus, Enterocloster bolteae, E.lavalensis, Flavonifractor plautii,
I.butyriciproducens, Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus xylosus, and the Proteo-
bacteria Providencia rettgeri. These ﬁndings agreed with signiﬁcant differential
abundance of C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris
and I.butyriciproducens inferred from 16 S rRNA amplicon analysis and resolved
species ambiguity for E.bolteae, E.lavalensis and L.murinus. Microbiome species
which were signiﬁcantly enriched in after 56 days of spaceﬂight comprised 14 Fir-
micutes, including B.pseudococcoides, C.difﬁcile, D.welbionis, E.clostridioformis,
Eisenbergiella massiliensis, E.muris, F.plautii, G.tenuis, H.hathewayi and R.lactati-
formans. Signiﬁcantly depleted species included 17 Firmicutes, including A.muris,
Anaerostipes caccae, B.wexlerae, C.scindens, C.cateniformis, E.aldenensis, E.bolteae,

erodimer which regulates production and secretion of ﬁbroblast
growth factor FGF15/19, the negative feedback hormone which travels
through portal circulation to bind hepatic FGFR4 receptors which
suppress liver bile acid biosynthesis via inhibition of Cyp7A182.

After 29 days of spaceﬂight, Abcc2 was signiﬁcantly downregulated,
suggestingreducedBAexporttothecolon,whileAsbt,Ibabp,Ostα,Ostβand
Ugt1a1 were all signiﬁcantly upregulated as well as Rxrα (not Fxr), Fgf15/19
and Fgfr4 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). Taken together,
these changessuggest spaceﬂight led to an alteration in bile acid metabolism
in the intestine whichwould lead to bile acid suppression of hepatic Cyp7A1
and accumulation of cholesterol or hypercholesterolaemia83. Interestingly,
intestinal Cyp7A1 expression was identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly repressed after
29 days of spaceﬂight. Previous proteomic research in Biom-1M mice
suggested a decrease in bile secretion during spaceﬂight84 while hepatic
metabolite assessment of mice after spaceﬂight in the Space Shuttle Atlantis
measured increased accumulation of cholate and taurodeoxycholate16. As
the major cholesterol degradation mechanism in humans and mice is
conversion to bile acids, cholesterol accumulation, alongside bile acid dys-
regulation and suppression of Cyp71A, should increase direct intestinal
cholesterol excretion85. Supporting this extrapolation, both cholesterol
excretion transporter genes, Abcg5 and Abcg8, were signiﬁcantly upregu-
lated in the intestine after 29 days of spaceﬂight.
After 56 days, intestinal Cyp7A1 was still signiﬁcantly repressed and
both Abcg5 and Abcg8 upregulated, but GSEA indicated a further shift in
intestinal bile acid metabolism (Fig. 5I, J; Supplementary Figs. 9–14). This
was underlined by signiﬁcant downregulation of the apical bile acid trans-
porter Asbt compared to ground controls as well as Ntcp (Slc10a1)86, indi-
cating a switch to active reduction in bile acid uptake. Coinciding with this
was signiﬁcant increases in expression of Lxrβ, the liver x receptor gene
expressed widely in different tissues, which can help prevent bile acid
toxicity through induction of Abcg5 and Abcg8 mediated cholesterol
excretion87–90.
In gene expression analysis of multiple tissues in mice after space-
ﬂight, da Silveira et al.18 found that enrichment within the circadian
rhythm pathway of the kidney, liver, eye, adrenal gland and various
muscle tissues. Within the intestine here, the major clock genes, the cir-
cadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) and brain and muscle
ARNT-like protein-1 (Bmal1; Arntl) transcription factors, were sig-
niﬁcantly upregulated after 29 days and 56 days of spaceﬂight, and the
neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (Npas2) was upregulated after 56 days
(Fig. 5D; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). These regulate the major
clock-controlled genes reverse-erythroblastosis (Rev-Erbα and β) and
retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors, including gamma
(Rorc)91, as well as Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3), Cryptochrome (Cry1 and
Cry2) and basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) protein (Dec1 and Dec2)
genes92,93, all of which were signiﬁcantly downregulated after 56 days of
spaceﬂight except for Rev-Erbα (Nr1d1) (only downregulated after
29 days). These genes can feedback to inhibit Clock/Npas2 and Bmal1 as
part of a feedback loop94,95, and also regulate other the clock controlled
genes such as DBP, HLF and TEF, signiﬁcantly downregulated, and Nﬁl3
(E4BP4), signiﬁcantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceﬂight. These
spaceﬂight-associated changes in core clock genes, suchas upregulation of
Bmal1, Arntl and Npas2, largely agree with those found in murine muscle
tissue after longer-term spaceﬂight which were characterised as similar to
age-related gene expression on earth96.
These clock genes regulate nutrient absorption, gut motility, intestinal
barrier function and immunity92 and have also been shown to require and
interact with the microbiome, including in response to microbially-derived
molecules, such as butyrate and bile acids, and in direct response to
microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)53,92,97–99. In addition to
the widespread intestinal gene expression responses to bile acids, the major
butyrate receptorfreefattyacid receptor2(Ffar2;Gpr43)100wassigniﬁcantly
upregulated after 56 days of spaceﬂight. Similarly, the archetypal intestinal
MAMP recognising mannose-binding lectin genes, Mbl-1 and Mbl-2101,
were signiﬁcantly downregulated. Furthermore, Wang et al.102 reported host
immune responses to microbial ﬂagellin and lipopolysaccharide in the
intestine increased expression of Il-23, and Il-22, leading to a down-
regulation of Rev-Erb and subsequent upregulation of Nﬁl3, which in turn

followed this speciﬁc expression pattern after spaceﬂight (Supplementary
Data 5), implying the spaceﬂight associated microbiome alterations could

Intestinal extracellular matrix remodelling and immune com-
promise during spaceﬂight
Changes in the extracellular matrix-receptor interactions pathway were
underpinned by signiﬁcant upregulation of collagens (Col1a1-2, Col3a1,
Col4a1-2, Col5a1-2, Col5a3, Col6a2-3, Col12a1, Col26a1), laminins
(Lama3), thrombospondin (Thbs1) and tenascins (Tnc) in mice after
29 days of spaceﬂight, which became more pronounced after 56 days of
spaceﬂight (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Data 5). This coincided with upregu-
lation of integrin (Itga5 and Itga7) and matrix glycoprotein (Sdc4 and Gp5)
receptors, collectively implying extensive extracellular matrix remodelling
duringspaceﬂight. The ECM and mucosal collagenscaffold in particular are
known to be shaped by microbiota103, as are mucins, which make up the
intestinal mucus layer and have a dynamic relationship with commensal
bacteria as well as serving as a critical barrier against colonisation by
pathogenic bacteria104. Signiﬁcant increase in the secretory mucin gene
Muc2 and signiﬁcant decreases in the membrane bound Muc3 and mucosal
pentraxin 1 (Mptx1), three of the mostly highly abundant transcripts in the
murine intestine here, were observed after 56 days of spaceﬂight, suggesting
alterations to mucin within the intestinal lumen in direct contact with
microbiota. Mucin 2 (Muc2) is well characterised as regulated by intestinal
bacteria, with O-glycans serving as nutrients and adhesion sites for
microbiota105, but are also differentially expressed in response to
pathogens104, including Trichinella106, identiﬁed here.
Extensive changes to mucosa were indicated by widespread
downregulation of cell adhesion molecules during spaceﬂight,
including downregulation of CD8a and CD8b1 genes, genes encoding
costimulatory molecules CD2,6,80,86,40 and ICOSL within intestinal
antigen presenting cells as well as their T cell activating binding
partners CD48,166,28 and ICOS107–109 (Fig. 5G; Supplementary Data 5).

Cytokine genes, such as the chemokine Ccl22 and receptor Ccr4
involved in the intestinal immune response to enteric bacterial
pathogens in murine mucosa110, were also uniformly downregulated
(Fig. 5F), alongside others111–113: Ccl3,5,6 and 22, Ccr4,7 and 9, Cxcr2,3

(wounding)116.
These expression proﬁles, alongside consistent downregulation of
genes within the Intestinal IgA pathway (Fig. 5H), suggest suppression of
immunity and widespread tissue remodelling at the host-gut microbiome
interface in mice after spaceﬂight. This agrees with reports of reduced
cytokine production in mice after simulated microgravity117, immune dys-
function in splenic tissue of mice after 13 days of spaceﬂight on the Space
Shuttle Atlantis118 and in astronauts, alongside increases in plasma cortisol
concentration
which

during
spaceﬂight119. Taken together, this provides an insight into the role the host-
gut-microbiome interface might play in the current broad consensus of
immune dysregulation in spaceﬂight environments120.
Spaceﬂight alters gene expression in the liver
Hepatic gene differential expression analysis comparing mice after 29 days
and 56 days in space to their relative ground controls identiﬁed 4029 DE
genes and 4068 DE genes, respectively (FDR <0.1; Fig. 6A, H; Supplemen-
tary Figs. 15, 16 and Data 5). Of these, 48% and 49% were increased due to
29 days and 56 days of spaceﬂight, respectively. GSEA of liver tissue
responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to
29and56 daysofspaceﬂight(Fig.6I,J),includingdisruptionofbileacid and
energy metabolism.
Bile acid disruption underlies hepatic cholesterol accumulation
Themostabundantintestinaltranscriptsinmiceafter56daysofspaceﬂight,
differentially expressed and representing 8% and 9% of normalised counts,
were from the non-coding RNA Rn7s1 and Rn7s2 genes (7 S RNA 1 and 2;
Supplementary Data 5), respectively, which were recently characterised as
inhibitors of global mitochondrial transcription in mammals121. This is
consistent with the mitochondrial dysfunction highlighted as characteristic
of spaceﬂight pathogenicity in recent multiomic analysis performed by de
Silveira et al.18, who also characterised compromised liver function in mice
and astronauts after spaceﬂight compared ground controls, including
upregulation of Fgf21, a negative repressor of bile synthesis122, and accu-
mulation of total cholesterol (higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but
decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Here, another potent
repressor of Cyp7A1 bile synthesis, ﬁbroblast growth factor 1 (fgf1)123, was
upregulated in the liver of mice after 29 days of spaceﬂight, and the more
well known Fgf2116 was signiﬁcantly upregulated in the liver after both
29 days and 56 days of spaceﬂight.
Within the liver, Sterol 14-demethylase (Cyp51) catalyses the trans-
formation of lanosterol into cholesterol and Cyp7A1 is then the ﬁrst (and
rate-limiting) enzymatic step in transformation of cholesterol in primary
bile acid biosynthesis, which itself is strictly inhibited by bile acid
concentrations124. The production of bile salts is then a stepwise transfor-
mation process dependent on gene expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 7 (Hsd3b7) gene, cholic acid-speciﬁc Cyp8b1 gene and
acyl-CoenzymeAoxidase2(Acox2)beforeconjugationbyBaat,Acnat1and
Acnat2, and subsequent excretion in the bile ductby bile salt exporter pump
(BSEP)125,126. Cyp51,Cyp8b1 and Acox2 genes were signiﬁcantly upregulated
and Cyp7a1andFxr(Nr1h4)weresigniﬁcantlydownregulatedintheliverof
mice after 56 days on the ISS (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data
5). The cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5 and Abcg8 (intestinally upre-
gulatedafter29and56 daysofspaceﬂight)wereupregulatedintheliverafter
29 days,butnolongersigniﬁcantlyupregulatedafter56 days,andAbcg8was
signiﬁcantly downregulated. This reduction is surprising given the uniform
accumulation of cholesterol observed afterextended spaceﬂight; in contrast,
Bsep and the bile acid conjugating acyl-coenzyme A:amino acid
N-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (Acnat1 and Acnat2; Baatp1/2) genes were sig-
niﬁcantly upregulated. Taken together, these expression proﬁles suggest
hepatic accumulation of cholesterol, characteristic of glucose and lipid
metabolic dysruption97, and describe a subsequent increase in the produc-
tion bile acids in the liver, preferentially cholic acid, their subsequent con-
jugation and export as bile salts, with the seemingly contradictory reduction
in Cyp7A1 consistent with feedback inhibition.
The other major mechanism for detoxiﬁcation during cholesterol and
bileacidaccumulationintheliverissulfonationofbileacids,thetransferofa
sulfonate group to a hydroxyl (OH) by a subfamily of cytosolic sulfo-
transferases (Sult2a genes) which increases their solubility, decreases
enterohepatic recirculation, and increase excretion127. After 29 days of
spaceﬂight, hepatic Sult2a1, Sult2a4 and Sult2a5 were downregulated,
which shifted to downregulation of Sult2a7 and Sult2a8 after 56 days
(Supplementary Data 5). In humans, bile acid sulfonation is catalysed by
Sult2a1, which sulfonates the 3-OH of bile acids. In contrast, mice have 8
Sult2a genes, with Sult2a1-6 sharing close homology to Sult2a1 but Sult2a8
being recently characterised as having major function in sulfonating 7α-OH
of bile acids128,129, of particular relevance here due to spaceﬂight microbiome
changes in 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris and C. scindens. Notably, during
acute phase immune responses, alterations to fatty acid, cholesterol, and bile
acid metabolism, Sult2a1 is known to be suppressed by cholesterol and bile
acidregulatingnuclearFxr(Nr1h4)andCar(Nr1i3)nuclearreceptors130,the
latter of which also regulates bile acid responsive transporter gene Mdr1
(ABCB1)131, all three of which were downregulated after 56 days of space-
ﬂight (Fig. 6C) and provide further evidence of bile acid dysregulation and
toxic stress consistent with extensive disruption of the gut-liver axis132.
Hepatic energy homoeostasis disruption after spaceﬂight
Beheshti et al.17 observed signiﬁcant depletion in Cyp7A1 protein levels in
mice after spaceﬂight (RR1 and RR3), alongside disruption in glucose and
lipid metabolism133 as well as NAFLD134. Here, pathways related to energy
homoeostasis consistently altered in gene expression due to spaceﬂight after
29 and 56 days included enrichment of fatty acid degradation, insulin sig-
nalling and insulin resistance (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and
Data 5). The highest relative abundance (CPM) of transcripts signiﬁcantly
increased in the liver of mice after 56 days of spaceﬂight included fatty acid
synthase (Fasn), the liver fat accumulation-associated carbonic anhydrase 3
(Car3)135, and the rate limiting enzyme for fatty acid desaturation, Stearoyl-

ferentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 9–14.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway
level between 29 days and 56 days of spaceﬂight. This included widespread down-
regulation of the components of the intestinal immune system after spaceﬂight,
including intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen processing and
presentation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, PARR signalling metabolism of
xenobiotics, Staphylococcus aureus infection, T cell receptor signalling, natural killer
cell mediated cytotoxicity, graft-vs-host disease and cytokine-cytokine receptor
interactions pathways, as well as downregulation of cholesterol pathways, including
cholesterol metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Spaceﬂight also led to
common upregulation of pathways associated to intestinal extracellular matrix
(ECM) remodelling, including ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, tight
junction, gap junction pathways, and cortisol production represented through the
Cushing syndrome pathway. The bile secretion pathway was signiﬁcantly upregu-
lated after 29 days of spaceﬂight, but downregulated after 56 days, suggesting bile
acid dynamics should be explored at the gene level. Similarly, mucin type O-glycan
biosynthesis, pathways in cancer and insulin resistance were only upregulated at the
pathway level after 29 days of spaceﬂight, while bacterial invasion of epithelial cells,
NAFLD, butonoate metabolism, insulin secretion and insulin signalling pathways
were upregulated and the circadian rhythm pathway was downregulated after only
56 days of spaceﬂight.

CoA desaturase (SCD), recently identiﬁed as a key role at the crossroads of
immune response and lipid metabolism through interplay with PPARγ136,
also signiﬁcantly upregulated here (Fig. 6F). Glucose metabolism was also
disrupted by spaceﬂight as the glucose transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2) gene,
required forglucose-stimulatedinsulinsecretion137,andglycogensynthase2
(Gys2) gene, the rate limiting enzyme for glycogenesis138, were down-
regulated in the liver (and intestine) after both 29 days and 56 days of
spaceﬂight. The free fatty acid and glycolysis regulating PPARα was also
downregulated, and liver glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl) and glycogen
synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3β) were signiﬁcantly upregulated after 56 days

synthesisand increase in glycogenolysisischaracteristicofinsulinresistance
leading to the elevated fasting plasma glucose to pre-diabetic levels pre-
viously observed in crew of the Mars500 analogue mission and during
spaceﬂight139–141. Interestingly, in light of spaceﬂight induced changes to gut
microbiota, upregulation of Gsk3β is also known to be activated by
microbial-associated molecular patterns142 and promotes acute liver failure
through inhibition of the PPARα pathway143.
OtherpathwaysenrichedintheliverafterspaceﬂightincludedCushing
Syndrome, hypercortisolism consistent with elevation of cholesterol levels,
and hepatocellular cancer pathways. Notably, claudins, which were largely
downregulated in the intestine where they are commonly expressed within
tight junctions, were upregulated in liver tissue after 56 days of spaceﬂight
(Supplementary Data 5), including highly signiﬁcant and high relative
abundance increases in CLDN1 and CLDN2. So-called non-tight junction
claudins have only recently been experimentally explored and, in hepatic
cells, CLDN1 is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)144. More

Previous gene expression analysis of mice exposed to high-energy ion
particle radiation to simulate exposure to Galactic Cosmic Rays reported
induction of spontaneous HCC146. These prominent transcriptomic shifts
after 56 days of spaceﬂight, if reﬂected in longer term studies in humans,
could represent a serious health concern.
Discussion
A challenge for biological experimentation conducted in space is low
replication, compared to model studies using mice on Earth. An important
associated shortfall of this research is the lack of assessment of inter-cage
variation. The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use of
distinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-
assembled WMS, helped provide some biological and technical conﬁdence
in the spaceﬂight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here;
however, it is likely that low n reduced statistical power and that important
microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance
bacteria. It is important that the imminent commercial low Earth orbit
destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacity
of their experimental habitats and growth facilities to support replicate
numbersformultiomic science,inorderto maximisediscoveriesand enable
future interventional microbiome studies.
This research also lacked truly independent cohorts of mice, as Liver
Animal Return (29 days spaceﬂight) and ISS (56 days spaceﬂight), and their
respective ground controls, derived from the same initial cohort of mice.
Future studies should ensure common data gathering approaches to enable
high resolution multiomic data to be directly compared across missions and
different cohorts of mice. Integration of metagenomic and host tran-
scriptomic data here provided a highly complementary picture of the mul-
tiomic response to spaceﬂight, and is a strength of an Open Science culture
andpublicmultiomicresourcessuchasGeneLab.Theadditionofuntargeted
serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this
research and future studies should aim to quantitatively proﬁle the speciﬁc
deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the
system. Alongside metatranscriptomic analysis of the gut microbiome, this
wouldrepresentanimportantnextsteplikelytohelpclarifythedirectionality
of the host-gut microbiome responses associated to spaceﬂight pathology.
Conclusions
Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, sig-
niﬁcant spaceﬂight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty
acid metabolism were identiﬁed. These changes in relative abundance were
largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceﬂight when compared to
different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when
using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes
coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut
microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe inter-
actions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest
disruptionofthesignals,metabolites,and immunefactorsexchanged across
the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation.
Collectively, these multiomic ﬁndings suggest host-gut microbiome inter-
actions during spaceﬂight are likely to underly widespread changes to host
physiology which could pose a risk to health.
Methods
Experimental design
Female 32 weeks-old C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences sources)
from four treatment groups of the Rodent Research 6 mission were com-
pared: ﬂight live animal return (FLT_LAR), ground control for live animal
return (GC_LAR), ﬂight ISS (FLT_ISS) and ground control for ISS
(GC_ISS) (Fig. 1). FLT_ISS and FLT_LAR mice comprised 40 mice that
were launched on SpaceX-13 and transferred to the rodent research habitat
on the ISS whereas their matched ground controls, GC_ISS and GC_LAR,
were 40mice kept in identical rodent habitats at Kennedy Space Centre. Not
all mice were available to NASA GeneLab for DNA and RNA extractions
(replicate numbers provided below). Diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001) and
deionized autoclaved water were provided ad libitum, and a 12:12 h dark/
light cycle maintained. After 29 days of ﬂight onboard the ISS, FLT_LAR
mice were returned to earth as part of the Live Animal Return (13/1/18)and
sacriﬁced alongside GC_LAR using common processing at ages of 41 weeks
old (16/1/18). FLT_ISS mice were sacriﬁced after 53–56 days of ﬂight
onboard the ISS at the same time as GC_ISS mice at the Kennedy Space
Centre at 44 weeks old using a common timeline and methodology.
During this period in the Destiny module (US laboratory) on the ISS,
the mice were exposed to an average daily 165.8 µGy d−1 Galactic Cosmic
Ray (GCR) dose and 117.3 µGy d−1 South Atlantic Anomaly (energetic
protons) dose (data provided by Ames Life Sciences Data Archive -
ALSDA). This is in line with standard range of exposure on the ISS148, and
represents around a 100% increase to common exposure on earth. The
temperature, relative humidity and elevated carbon dioxide levels on the ISS
were mimicked in the ground control rodent habitats at the Kennedy Space
over the 56 days of spaceﬂight, so were not signiﬁcantly different (t-test,

differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 17–21.
GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the
pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceﬂight. These comprised downregulation of
immune response pathways, similar to those seen in the intestine, as well as steroid
metabolism, type I diabetes mellitus, inﬂammatory bowel disease and NAFLD.
Spaceﬂight also led to common upregulation of insulin resistance, Hippo signalling,
inositol phosphate metabolism, Cushing syndrome and hepatocellular cancer
pathways at both 29 and 56 days. Certain pathways were different over time. After
29 days of spaceﬂight, long-term depression and maturity onset diabetes of the
young pathways were upregulated, whereas after 56 days, bile secretion and circa-
dian rhythm were downregulated, while glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were
upregulated.

Care and Use Committee (IACUC). As outlined in the NASA Genelab
record (OSD-249), Anaesthesia for the LAR mice groups was induced using
isoﬂurane. For the ISS mice groups, anaesthesia was administered via
intraperitoneal injection of ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine during
the dissection period, which occurred 53–56 days post-launch. Blood
samples were obtained via closed-chest cardiac puncture,though these were
not used in this study. Euthanasia was performed by exsanguination fol-
lowed by thoracotomy. The ISS spaceﬂight mice carcasses underwent hind
limb dissection, which was not used in this study, then were wrapped in
aluminium foil, placed in Ziploc bags, and stored at −80 °C or colder until
return. The ISS Ground Control followed the same euthanasia methods and
preservation timeline at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Experimental end-
points included the collection of blood samples, completion of hind limb
dissection, and collection of faecal samples. Faecal samples were extruded
from the colon during dissection, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored
at −80 °C. Additionally, liver and colon (RNASeq explored here), and
spleen, lung, thymus, and dorsal skin samples were collected for further
analysis.
DNA extraction
Faecal samples from 32 RR6 mice were available for DNA extraction: n = 9
mice from FLT_LAR, n = 7 mice from GC_LAR, n = 7 mice from FLT_ISS
and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC
Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) (OSD-
249). Half of a frozen faecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB
solution and homogenised using tissue homogenising bead mix (Navy
RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for
4 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 °C and
21,000 g to deﬂate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used
to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was
eluted in 105 µL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep
PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research). Concentrations for all DNA
samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc, Waltham, MA) with a Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size
were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a gDNA ScreenTape
Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequence data is
available in the NASA GeneLab record OSD-249.
16S rRNA gene ampliﬁcation
DNA library preparation was performed by the Genome Research Core
(GRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was
used as input to a two-stage PCR ampliﬁcation protocol149,150. In the ﬁrst
stage, primers 515 F/806 R (Earth Microbiome Project, V4 targeting) con-
taining Fluidigm ‘Common Sequence’ linkers (CS1 and CS2) were used to
amplify gDNA. In the second stage, Fluidigm AccessArray barcoded pri-
mers were used to amplify PCR products from the ﬁrst stage and incor-
porateIllumina sequencing adaptors and a sample barcode. Sequencingwas
performedon an Illumina MiniSeq mid-output ﬂow cell, employing paired-
end 2 × 153 base reads.
Whole metagenome sequencing
Whole metagenome sequence libraries were prepared using an Illumina
Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Input DNA was ~100 ng per reaction, and
ﬁve cycles of PCR were performed. Index adaptors used were IDT for
Illumina,96-wellNextera Flex DualIndexAdapters,setA.Libraryfragment
sizes (~550 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with
D1000 DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled
library concentration was measured with a KAPA Library quantiﬁcation kit
(Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an
Illumina iSeq100sequencer(Illumina,San Diego, CA). Wholemetagenome
shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instru-
mentwitha 500-cycleSPﬂowcell.Librarypreparationandsequencingwere
performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research
Center).
RNA extraction and sequencing
Colon samples from 36 RR6 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10
mice from FLT_LAR, n = 8 mice from GC_LAR, n = 9 mice from FLT_ISS
and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. Liver samples from 39 mice were available for
RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 9 mice from GC_LAR,
n = 10 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 10 mice from GC_ISS. RNA was
extracted from mouse tissue samples using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenisation buffer for RNA puriﬁcation was
made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen
colon (OSD-247) or liver (OSD-245) tissue was isolated using a scalpel,
weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution.
Homogenisation was performed using tissue homogenising bead mix
(Zirconium Oxide 2.0 mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24
(Next Advance) for 5 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min
at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample
was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentrations for all
RNA samples were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo
FisherScientiﬁc,Waltham,MA).RNAqualitywasassessedusinganAgilent
2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Kit or RNA 6000 Pico Kit
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In
Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA Cat 4456739, v92) at 1:100
dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prepat the
concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol.
Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using an Illumina TruSeq
Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Input RNA amounts were
~500 ng; RNA RIN values were > 4. Index adaptors were 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-
well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles of PCR were performed.
Library fragment sizes (~300 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200
TapeStation with a D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR
Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control
was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego,
CA). Whole metagenome sequencing was performed on an Illumina
NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP ﬂow cell. Library preparation
and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab
(NASAAmesResearchCenter)andallRNAsequencingdataisprovidedfor

using
Anchor28,35,139,151,152.Exactsequencevariants(ESV)wereidentiﬁedinplaceof
operational taxonomic units (OTUs)153,154. Sequences were aligned and
dereplicated using Mothur155 and a count threshold parameter of 96.
Annotation at family, genus or species-level used BLASTn criteria of >99%
identity and coverage to the NCBI 16 S curated and NCBI nr/nt databases
(January 2022 versions). Differentially abundant ESVs were manually
assessed for quality. When the highest identity/coverage was shared
amongst multiple different references, all annotations were retained and
reported.
Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2156,157,
which performs well with sparse data and uneven library sizes158. Sparsity
and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample
was required to be <90% of the count in all samples, and ESV counts were
required to be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group35. A false
discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 correction was
applied159.
Whole metagenome sequencing co-assembly and annotation
Quality control used Trim Galore! (v0.6.6)160, a wrapper script to automate
quality and adaptor trimming as well as quality control. Trim Galore is
based on cutadapt (v2.10)161 and fastqc (v0.11.5)162. Trim Galore! PARA-

potential contamination from human using the masked version of hg19
human assembly. To remove redundancy in read dataset and reduce the
computational load, reads were normalised using ORNA164 with the fol-
lowing parameters: -sorting 1 -base 1.7 -kmer 21.
MEGAHIT v1.2.9165 was used to assemble reads from all samples into
one co-assembly using meta-large option. Kallisto (v0.46.2)166 expectation
maximisation algorithm was used to complete metagenomics read assign-
ment and infer contig abundance167. Prodigal (v2.6.3)168 was used with the
option meta to predict open reading frames (ORFs) and BLAST v2.3.0169
was used to annotate contigs sequence.
To assign contig taxonomy, a ﬁrst alignment iteration was run using
full contig lengths against the NCBI nr/nt database (January 2022) and
Reference Viral Database (RVDB v v25.0). To further resolve nucleotide
taxonomic annotation, a second alignment was run against all databases
which included selected genomes (additional 1148 sequences) from NCBI
refseq informed by ﬁrst iteration. BLASTn was run using the following
parameters: -evalue 1e-50 -word_size 128 -perc_identity 97. Contig align-
ment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bit-
score was selected as the best alignment for a given contig. Descriptive
statistics were also provided for contigs with a common species annotation
that
had
an
average
alignment
identity
> 97%,
total
alignment
length > 3000 nt and an average query coverage > 20%. To validate ESV
sequences using the metagenomics de novo assembly, ESVs were aligned to
WMS contigs using BLASTn.
To annotate genes, three protein databases (NCBI nr, UniProtKB
Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL; January 2022) were searched using the translated
sequences of the predicted proteins. BLASTx was run with the following
parameters: -evalue 1e-10 -word_size 6 -threshold 21. Alignment scores
were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was
selectedas the best alignment for a given orf. GO, pfam, PANTHER, EMBL,
InterPro, HAMAP, TIGRFAMs, STRING, HOGENOM, SUPFAM terms
were mined from UniProtKB database. Amino acid sequences were used as
input in the GhostKOALA webserver170 to add functional genes and path-
ways information. KEGG functional and taxonomic annotation was
retrieved using complete and incomplete pathways. Extibacter muris strain
DSM28560 bile acid-inducible operon sequence (baiBCDEFGHI)62, were
manually added to default KEGG database. One bai sequencedid not have a
KEGG term associated to it (baiG MFS transporter; bile acid transporter)
and a temporary KEGG term was assigned to it (K9999).
Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs)
Using metagenome co-assembly from 3.4.2, genome binning was per-
formed using MetaBAT2171. Genome quality estimation of all bins was
performed using CheckM (version v1.1.6)172. Taxonomic classiﬁcation was
performed with Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) a pipeline for the taxonomic
classiﬁcation of metagenome assembled genomes173.
Murine transcriptome reference mapping
Mouse liver and colon RNA-Seq reads were processed and assembled fol-
lowing NASA GeneLab consensus pipeline, as described previously174.
Alpha and beta diversity
To estimate and compare microbial richness within samples, alpha diversity
was measured using diversity indices using Phyloseq R library175 and was
compared between groups with t-tests (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U
(non-parametric) tests. Unsupervised multivariate analysis (ordination)
was performed using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with normal-
isedcounts(SupplementaryData 1)whileconstrainedordinationwasbased
on distance-based Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CCA).
Signiﬁcance of constraints were assessed using ANOVA-like permutation
testing for CCA (anova.cca). Vegan R library176 was used to conduct these
analyses, statistics, and to produce graphs and draw dispersion ellipses. As
an exploratory visualisation of annotated WMS contigs, Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to reduce the dimen-
sionality of beta diversity WMS contig count matrices. CPM normalised
counts of differentially abundant species (30 in each comparison) were
selectedasinputandumapfunctionfromtheumapRpackage(v0.2.10)was
used for each comparison with default parameters. Care should be taken
when interpreting relative abundances as amplicon-based and WMS
microbiome proﬁling lacks absolute quantiﬁcation and is vulnerable to
biases from PCR ampliﬁcation and/or sequencing depth.
Differential abundance/expression analysis
Prior to differential abundance analysis, sparsity and count thresholds were
applied whereby an ESV/contig/transcript count in a single sample must
be <90% of the count across all samples and ESV/contig occurrence must be
at least ≥3 in samples within the same design factor.
Differential abundance (or expression) analysis was performed
using DESeq2159 based on pre-processed raw abundance of ESVs/con-
tigs/ORFs/transcripts.
A
false
discovery
rate
(FDR;
Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure) <0.1 was applied for statistical signiﬁcance156.
Missingness is a known challenge for negative binomial regression
models (such as used in DESeq2) when analyzing zero-inﬂated abun-
dance tables177,178, contigs with an absolute zero across all replicated
samples belonging to a same factor were assumed to be structural zeros
and ﬂagged as signiﬁcantly differentially abundant. To address con-
servative p-value distribution179 of RNA-Seq differential expression
analysis, local FDR values were computed from DESeq2 p-values using
fdrtool (v1.2.17)180 R library.
Functional enrichment analysis
Ghostkoala output was organised into a gene count table using WMS ORF
raw count table and used as input for over-representation analysis (ORA) of
WMS data. ORA was used to statistically test the overlap between DA ORFs
(FDR <0.1) and a geneset using pathways of interest (Supplementary Data
4).p-valueswerecalculatedusingahypergeometrictestusingclusterProﬁler
(v4.7.1.003) R library181.
Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNASeq data was performed
on the Webgestalt182 platform using the entire gene list, rank-ordered
combining signiﬁcance and effect size from DESeq2 differential expression
analysis, i.e. log2(FC)*-log(pValue)183. Gene symbols were inferred from
assembly transcripts using org.Mm.eg.db (v3.16)184 R annotation library.
