Abstract: The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune
cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM).
Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD)
feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of
its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic proﬁle during obesity. Mrc1−/−
mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight
gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed.
Extensive ﬂow cytometry proﬁling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After
HFD feeding, Mrc1−/−mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid
progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls.
Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inﬂammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1−/−
mice together with reduced inﬁltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver
compared to controls. Liver histological proﬁling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis
revealed that Mrc1−/−mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins
belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This proﬁle was reﬂected by improved glucose
and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1−/−mice compared
to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deﬁciency impacts BM
and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inﬂammation and
resistance to obesity development.

1. Introduction
The mannose receptor (Mrc1) is a unique type 1 transmembrane receptor that is a
member of the C-type lectin family. Mrc1 can be located on non-vascular endothelium,
macrophages [1], and dendritic cells [2] as well as in the serum in a shortened soluble
form [3]. It presents eight C-type lectin domains (CTLDs), of which only number four
is functional, and recognizes mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) [4].
Moreover, Mrc1 has a ﬁbronectin type II (FNII) domain with a high afﬁnity for collagen [5],
and a terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain which binds sulfated sugars [6].
Because of its complex structure, the mannose receptor recognizes several ligands,
including circulating hormones [7,8] and adhesion molecules [9]. This aspect, together
with its wide expression, allows Mrc1 to be involved in several processes including the

immune response. It has been proposed that Mrc1 plays a key role during the immune
response because of its ability to recognize mannose residues [10], expressed as terminal
glycan moiety on lysosomal enzymes released during inﬂammation [11] or as part of
microbial walls [12], and because of its participation in leukocyte trafﬁcking. The mannose
receptor expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells interacts with the highly glycosylated
protein CD44 on lymphocytes, directly regulating their trafﬁcking [9]. Notably, Mrc1 is
also expressed in the bone marrow compartment by both macrophages [13] and sinusoidal
endothelium [14], which are known to modulate both the proliferation/maturation of
hematopoietic stem cells and the extravasation of immune cells [15].
Conditions that cause systemic inﬂammation, such as metabolic disturbances and
obesity [16], impair bone marrow hematopoiesis and promote the production of pro-
inﬂammatory mediators by sinusoidal ECs [17]. The outcomes of these conditions also
activate an immune inﬂammatory response within several target tissues, including the
adipose tissue and the liver. The aims of our study were to investigate (1) the role of the
mannose receptor in the bone marrow during obesity development and (2) the relationship
between the mannose receptor function and changes in systemic inﬂammation. We fed
Mrc1−/−and control WT mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and observed that Mrc1
deﬁciency resulted in reduced myelopoiesis associated with an increased adipocyte count
in the bone marrow. This was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction of circulating myeloid
inﬂammatory cells together with a reduced inﬁltration of monocyte-derived macrophages
in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and in the liver. The improved inﬂammatory response
in Mrc1-deﬁcient mice was paralleled by reduced body weight gain during HFD feeding,
reduced liver steatosis, and improved glucose and insulin response compared to WT mice.
These data suggest that the mannose receptor could be involved in the development of the
immunometabolic response associated with diet-induced obesity.
2. Materials and Methods
Extensive details of the materials and methods used in our study are provided as an
online supplement.
2.1. Mice
Mrc1−/−mice on a C57BL/6J background were used and compared to age-matched
C57BL/6J wild-type littermates.
Four animals were housed per cage and kept in a
temperature-controlled environment (20 ± 2◦C, 50 ± 5% relative humidity) with a 12 h
light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. Six- to 8-week-old male mice were
fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% Kcal from fat, Cat. No. D12451, Research diets Inc., New
Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was measured weakly. All mice were
sacriﬁced after overnight fasting using isoﬂurane (2%) inhalation, and then blood was
collected using an intracardiac puncture. We also collected and weighed visceral adipose
tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the
liver, femurs, and tibias from the mice. All animal procedures conformed to the guidelines
from directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the protection of animals used
for scientiﬁc purposes and were approved by the Ethical Committee (Progetto di Ricerca
2012/02, Autorizzazione Ministeriale 929/2020).
2.2. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests
The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were used to measure
the plasmatic clearance of glucose after intraperitoneal injection of glucose or insulin,
respectively. For the GTT, animals were fasted overnight (approximately 14 h) and then
blood glucose levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the
injection of a glucose solution (10% w/v in physiological solution, 1 mg per gram of body
weight). Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucometer (ONE-TOUCH Ultra
glucometer, Lifescan, Milpitas, CA, USA). For the ITT, animals were fasted for 4 h and then
glucose plasma levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the

injection of human recombinant insulin (0.75 mU per gram of body weight, Humulin R
U-100, 100 U/mL).
2.3. Sample Preparation for Flow Cytometry
Immunophenotyping was performed on blood or single-cell suspensions that were
previously obtained from bone marrow centrifugation (as described in Fan Y. et al. [18]),
visceral adipose tissue collagenase digestion (as previously described [19]), or liver dissocia-
tion and stratiﬁcation. Whole blood was incubated with an antibody mix for 30 min at 4 ◦C
and then ﬁxed and lysed (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell suspensions from each tissue were stained with the antibody mix at
4 ◦C for 30 min. Washes and the ﬁnal resuspension for acquisition were performed using
PBS with FBS 2% and EDTA 2 mM. Samples were acquired with LSRFortessa X-20 (BD)
and analyzed with Novoexpress software (version 1.6.0, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Further details on tissue preparation are provided in the Supplementary Materials. The
antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
2.4. Femurs, Liver, and Adipose Tissues Histology
Mouse femurs were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 ◦C, decalciﬁed in
0.5 M EDTA pH 8 for 5 days at 4 ◦C, and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane.
Longitudinal femur sections (10 µm thick) were incubated with anti-perilipin 1 antibody
(1:200; Cat. No. 9349, Cell Signalling Technology®, Danvers, MA, USA). An anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted to 1:200
in PBS plus 1% BSA was incubated for 40 min at 37 ◦C. Nuclei were counterstained with
Hoechst 33342 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Images (10×) were acquired with a
Leica DM6B automated upright microscope (Leica Biosystems S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and then
processed with Fiji/ImageJ software (version 1.50, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Adipocytes
were manually quantiﬁed with Fiji/ImageJ based on perilipin-1 immunostaining.
Part of the liver, VAT, SCAT, and BAT was ﬁxed overnight in 4% buffer formalin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) embedded in parafﬁn and then 5 µm tissue sec-
tions were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Sigma-Aldrich). Images of H&E-
stained sections were acquired using the Axiovision Zeiss software (version 4.8, Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) at 10× magniﬁcation. We evaluated liver steatosis using ImageJ
software and the adipocytes area of VAT and SCAT using the Adiposoft Plugin, considering
two ﬁelds per section, for a total of 10 sections per animal. To assess hepatic neutrophil
activation, immunohistochemistry staining of liver sections was performed using the Anti-
Neutrophil Elastase antibody (1:200; Cat. No. ab68672, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed
by the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:750; Sigma-Aldrich), a reaction with DAB
Liquid Substrate System (Sigma-Aldrich), and nuclei counterstaining with haematoxylin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired with Axiovision Zeiss software at 10x magniﬁcation
and elastase-positive areas were quantiﬁed with ImageJ software.
2.5. Proteomics Analysis
A proteomics analysis was performed as previously described [20]. Brieﬂy, mice livers
(n = 3 WT mice and n = 3 Mrc1−/−) were pooled up to 20 mg and lysed with urea 8M, Tris-
HCl 0.1 M pH 8.5 in the presence of protease inhibitors at a ratio of 1:100 (Cell Signalling,
Cat. No. 5872S). The liver samples were then quantiﬁed and prepared for LC-MS/MS
analysis. For plasma, 30 µL samples (n = 4 WT mice and n = 4 Mrc1−/−mice) were pooled,
and the concentration was quantiﬁed by NanoDrop A280 nm (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, USA) for LC-MS/MS analysis. Methodological details are provided in the
Supplementary Materials.
2.6. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
For the gene expression analysis, brown adipose tissue was homogenized with Tis-
sueRuptor II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy

Metabolites 2022, 12, 1205
4 of 14
Lipid Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was ﬁrst quanti-
ﬁed with a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and then retro-
transcribed to cDNA with iScript™Reverse Transcription Supermix (Cat. No. 1708841,
Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A 20 ng sample of the cDNA was used for ampliﬁcation by
real-time quantitative PCR (CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System instrument,
Cat. No. 1855201, Bio-Rad) with the Luna® Universal qPCR Master Mix (Cat. No. M3003E,
New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). For each ampliﬁcation, 1 µM of each primer
was used to a ﬁnal volume of 15 µL of the reaction mix with 7.5 µL of the master MIX.
The threshold cycle number (Ct) values for each reaction were calculated. Gene
expression was calculated as 2∆∆Ct adjusted to the expression of the housekeeping gene
Rpl-13a and as a fold difference of Mrc1−/−to control group. The primer sequences used in
this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
2.7. Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism (version 9, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for
graphical representation and statistical analyses of the data. Results are given as the mean
per group ± standard error of the mean (SEM). For comparison between the two groups,
an unpaired parametric two-sided T-test with a 95% conﬁdence interval was used when
the data sets followed a normal distribution. For non-normal data, the Mann–Whitney
nonparametric unpaired T-test was applied. A p-value of <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
The DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery,
NIAID, North Bethesda, MD, USA) platform was used for gene ontology (GO) and KEGG
enrichment analyses. GO and KEGG were performed using our protein LFQ dataset,
and results for signiﬁcant terms associated with the gene set were selected based on the
FDR < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Mrc1 Deﬁciency in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet Affects Bone Marrow Myelopoiesis and
Adiposity, Which Results in Dampened Immune-Inﬂammatory Response in the Circulation
To investigate whether mannose receptor deﬁciency affects the immune cell proﬁle
during obesity, we ﬁrst characterized the circulating immune cell proﬁle for the Mrc1−/−
and control WT male mice fed an HFD for 20 weeks with a focus on myeloid populations
(gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure S1A–F). The Mrc1−/−mice displayed
a signiﬁcant reduction in neutrophils (Figure 1A) and inﬂammatory CCR2+ monocyte
counts (Figure 1B). Although, the total monocyte numbers were not different between the
two experimental groups (Figure 1C). A trend toward the reduction of circulating CD11b+
myeloid cells was also observed (Figure 1D), whereas the counts of eosinophils (Figure 1E)
and circulating adaptive immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, were not different
(Figure 1F,G). We next investigated whether this proﬁle might be the consequence of
changes in the medullary compartment of Mrc1−/−as compared to WT male mice following
HFD feeding. To this aim, we proﬁled different hematopoietic precursor subsets and mature
immune cells (cell subsets investigated are presented in Supplementary Figure S2, and the
gating strategy used is presented in Supplementary Figure S3A–R) in the bone marrow of
the different animal models.
The number of early progenitors was similar in WT and Mrc1−/−mice, including that
of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs, Figure 1H), short-term hematopoietic stem
cells (ST-HSCs, Figure 1I), multipotent progenitors (MPPs, Figure 1J), common lymphoid
progenitors (CLPs, Figure 1K), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs, Figure 1L), and
granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs, Figure 1M). Interestingly, the amount of
more mature cells, including granulocyte progenitors (GPs, Figure 1N), pre-neutrophils
(PNs, Figure 1O), and mature neutrophils (MNs, Figure 1Q, representative plots Figure 1W),
were signiﬁcantly reduced in mice lacking Mrc1 as compared to controls.

as mean ± SEM, n = 8–10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.

Macrophage/dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs; Figure 1R), monocyte precursors (MOPs,
Figure 1S), and mature Ly6Clow (Figure 1T) and Ly6Chigh (Figure 1U) monocytes were not
affected. On the other hand, macrophages identified as Gr-1−CD115−F4/80+SSClow de-
creased in the bone marrow of Mrc1-deﬁcient mice compared to WT mice (Figure 1V,X).
This last trait was commonly associated with compromised retention of hematopoietic stem
cells in the niche [21], often as the consequence of altered crosstalk between the stem cell
niche and adipocytes within the bone marrow during hematopoiesis [22,23]. To investigate
this hypothesis, we compared the content of adipocytes in the bone marrow of Mrc1−/−
mice to control mice using Perilipin as an adipocyte marker with immunoﬂuorescence
staining (Figure 1Y). Adipocyte content signiﬁcantly increased in association with Mrc1
deﬁciency both in terms of cells per area and absolute count (Figure 1Z,AA). The obser-
vation of a similar value for adipocyte cell surface area between the experimental groups
(Figure 1AB) suggests that an investigation of differences in bone marrow adipogenesis
is required to explain the phenotype described above. Altogether, the decreased presence
of macrophages, the combination of reduced levels of myeloid precursors and mature
cells, and the increased adipocyte content suggest that the lack of Mrc1 could promote a
medullary rewiring in mice with diet-induced obesity. This medullary rewiring is reﬂected
in changes to the circulating immune subsets and systemic inﬂammatory status.
To explore this hypothesis, untargeted proteomic analysis of the plasma from the
different experimental groups was performed. Out of 4306 proteins identiﬁed, 4.4% were
downregulated and 3.4% were upregulated in the plasma of obese Mrc1−/−mice compared
to that of controls (Figure 2A,B). The different proteomic signature associated with Mrc1
deﬁciency was conﬁrmed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Figure 2C), which
showed a cluster clearly separated from that of plasma proteins from WT mice. To better
characterize this phenotype, differently abundant proteins were analyzed using the KEGG
database to assess enriched pathways in the plasma of Mrc1−/−mice compared to that of
WT mice (Figure 2D). Interestingly, ECM-receptor interaction, leukocyte transendothelial
migration, chemokine signaling pathway, and platelet activation (FDR < 0.05) displayed a
higher number of downregulated proteins (Figure 2E,F) in the plasma from Mrc1−/−mice.
These results suggest that the lack of the mannose receptor could affect the modulation of
immune cell inﬁltration.
Furthermore, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis conﬁrmed the impact of Mrc1 deﬁciency
on the modulation of the immune system function. The impact was shown by inhibited
canonical pathways (Z-score based) including hepatic ﬁbrosis signaling, NF-kB signaling,
PKCθ signaling in T cells, necroptosis, and increased PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (Figure 2G).
Overall, these data suggest that Mrc1 deﬁciency results in a protective BM phenotype
characterized by decreased myelopoiesis and increased presence of quiescence-promoting
adipocytes, coupled with changes in plasma proteome associated with a reduced number
of pro-inﬂammatory and tissue-inﬁltrating leukocytes.
3.2. Mrc1 Deﬁciency in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet Impacts Immune Inﬁltration of Metabolic
Tissues during Obesity
We performed ﬂow cytometry analyses on the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and
liver of WT and Mrc1−/−mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks to investigate whether
the reduced inﬂammatory and migratory phenotype of myeloid cells in circulation—as
suggested by proteomics analysis—was reﬂected by different recruitment of immune
cells in metabolically affected tissues. Interestingly, the mannose receptor deﬁciency was
associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in macrophages, speciﬁcally in monocyte-derived
macrophages (Figure 3A–C, gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure S4A–I), within
VAT, which suggests a different inﬁltrating capacity. This reduction was paralleled by a
signiﬁcant decrease in inﬂammatory CD11c+ macrophages (Figure 3D,F) in the Mrc1−/−
mice compared to the controls, which was particularly evident in the subpopulation
of macrophages expressing intermediate levels of F4/80 (Figure 3E) that are known to
originate from circulating monocytes [24]. A trend toward reduced VAT inﬁltrating myeloid

cells, monocytes, and CD11c+F4/80high macrophages was also observed (Figure 3G–J). This
trend was not observed for neutrophils and eosinophils (Figure 3K,L).

In parallel, liver immunophenotyping (gating strategy shown in Supplementary
Figure S5A–H) showed decreased levels of myeloid cells (Figure 3M) in Mrc1−/−mice,
which was more evident for monocytes (Figure 3N,P) and monocyte-derived macrophages
(Figure 3O) but not for other cell subsets (Supplementary Figure S5I–O). Interestingly,
although neutrophils were present in a comparable fashion in both experimental groups
(Supplementary Figure S5K), histological analysis of the expression of elastase—a marker
of neutrophil activation—on liver sections revealed a trend toward reduction in Mrc1−/−
mice compared to controls (Supplementary Figure S5P,Q). Such a reduction is in line with a
less severe inﬂammatory phenotype associated with the lack of the mannose receptor.
3.3. Immunomodulation in Mrc1−/−Mice Is Associated with Improved Obese Phenotype
We compared weight gain in Mrc1−/−and WT mice fed a high-fat diet to evaluate
whether the observed differences in the immune phenotype translate into an improved
metabolic proﬁle. This comparison revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in the weight gain of
Mrc1−/−mice compared to their WT counterpart (Figure 4A,B), which was in line with a
recent report [25]. This difference was not the result of changes in visceral adipose tissue
or subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, signiﬁcant differences were observed in the
relative weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the liver (Figure 4C). Nonetheless, the
moderate impact of these differences in explaining the reduction of animal weight suggests
that Mrc1 deﬁciency in mice fed an HFD might affect other tissues that were not evaluated
in our work. This limitation should be addressed in future studies. Notably, the adipocyte
area was not different in the VAT or SCAT from Mrc1−/−and WT mice (Figure 4D–F), but
smaller lipid droplets were observed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Figure 4D). These
smaller lipid droplets were coupled to signiﬁcant changes in the gene expression proﬁle of
genes associated with BAT function such as Ppara, Pgc1a, Atgl and Ucp1 (Figure 4G).
Reduced lipid accumulation was also observed in the liver (Figure 4H, I) prompting
us to proﬁle liver proteome. Among 2114 proteins, 344 were downregulated and 363 were
upregulated in Mrc1−/−mice (Supplementary Figure S6A,B). Differently abundant pro-
teins were analyzed using the KEGG database to assess enriched pathways (Figure 4J),
which were identiﬁed as being mainly metabolism related. One of the enriched pathways is
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, in which most molecules appear less abundant
in association with mannose receptor deﬁciency (Figure 4K), thus conﬁrming the previous
histological analysis. On the other hand, the gene ontology (GO) analysis identiﬁed the
enrichment of the cellular response to the IL-4 pathway, where proteins are mainly upregu-
lated (Figure 4L). This result suggests the presence of pro-resolutive immune activation,
which aligns with an overall downregulation of proteins within the cellular response to
the IFN-ƴ pathway [26] and with the reduced inﬁltration observed by ﬂow cytometry.
Reduced steatosis and inﬂammation pair with improved glucose and insulin tolerance, as
shown by more upregulated proteins in the GO cellular response to the insulin stimulus
pathway (Figure 4L), as well as a better performance following the glucose tolerance test
(GTT, Figure 4M) and an improved trend following insulin tolerance test (ITT, Figure 4N).
However, no signiﬁcant changes were observed in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol
levels (Supplementary Figure S6C,D). Thus, we observed that in mice fed an HFD for
20 weeks, the absence of the mannose receptor leads to a protective BM phenotype and

4. Discussion
Metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with increased
hematopoiesis [27] and dysfunctional endothelium, which in turn contribute to disrupt-
ing myelopoiesis [17]. This pro-inﬂammatory hematopoiesis not only aggravates the
dysmetabolic condition but also stands as an important risk factor for cardiovascular dis-
eases [28], calling for an investigation of the molecular mechanisms driving this effect.
Intriguingly, the soluble mannose receptor has been shown to stimulate tissue macrophage
activation towards inﬂammation, and its deﬁciency in mice fed an HFD resulted in reduced
tissue inﬂammation and a better metabolic phenotype [25].
However, the use of a whole-body Mrc1 knock-out mouse model has suggested that
the wide range in the expression of this receptor [10] would account for additional activities.
In this context, we showed that Mrc1 deﬁciency results in reduced inﬂammation that might
be the consequence of important changes in bone marrow cell signature.
Interestingly, Mrc1 is expressed by both macrophages and medullary sinusoidal en-
dothelial cells [14], where its expression increases following the onset of diabetes mellitus
within a panel of inﬂammatory genes [17]. Highly active myelopoiesis observed in dys-
metabolic conditions is commonly associated with a systemic immune activation charac-
terized by the increased frequency of blood inﬂammatory cells and circulating markers of
inﬂammation [29]. In our experimental setting, decreased levels of circulating neutrophils
and pro-inﬂammatory CCR2+ monocytes were indeed associated with the bone marrow
phenotype switch in Mrc1-deﬁcient mice. Our work revealed that the lack of the mannose
receptor modulates myelopoiesis, thus hampering the enhancement observed in animals
fed with an HFD to induce obesity [30]. We demonstrated an important downregulation
of myeloid cell production as well as an increased presence of adipocytes. Considering
the role of CXCL12 in promoting HSCs quiescence, an increase in adipocytes, a known
source of CXCL12, could negatively modulate hematopoiesis by reducing the production
of inﬂammatory cells [22]. As a conﬁrmation, our plasma proteomics analysis showed
that the lack of the mannose receptor is paralleled by an overall reduction in leukocyte
migration and the tissue inﬁltration pathways. Notably, changes in glycoprotein catabolism
play a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism and cardiometabolic diseases [31].
Therefore, we investigated the immune phenotype of the visceral adipose tissue and
liver, as they represent tissues at the crossroad between the metabolic and inﬂammatory
response to obesity [32,33]. In Mrc1-deﬁcient mice, both tissues presented a reduced
inﬁltration of myeloid cells that contributed to an amelioration of the metabolic response
during HFD. Indeed, the recruitment of monocytes from circulation to adipose tissue
promotes the differentiation of macrophages with a pro-inﬂammatory phenotype at the
cost of anti-inﬂammatory macrophages [34].
Notably, Mrc1 deficiency appears to counterbalance this effect, limiting the
immunometabolic response observed during obesity. This ﬁnding seems unexpected
given that the Mrc1 receptor is one of the key markers of pro-resolutive macrophages [35].
However, previous studies have shown that the selective depletion of Mrc1+ macrophages
improves the systemic insulin response and lipid handling in adipose tissue [36]. These
results suggest the presence of parallel mechanisms related to the presence of the mannose
receptor that might be associated with the progression of metabolic disorders.
Of note, in this study, we used whole-body Mrc1 knock-out mice. Therefore, it
is possible that cells other than macrophages contributed to the phenotype observed.
Indeed, in addition to macrophages, the mannose receptor is expressed by a variety of cells
including non-immune cells, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells [1]. These cells have been
implicated in leucocyte trafﬁcking in lymphatic vessels [9]. Therefore, future studies should
investigate whether leucocyte trafﬁcking could also play a role in the observed phenotype.
In conclusion, we have shown that, during the onset of obesity, Mrc1 impacts hematopoi-
etic stem cell differentiation and release. In addition, Mrc1 deﬁciency impacts the BM cell
proﬁle and reduces the number of activated immune cells in circulation and their inﬁltration
in tissues, thus dampening obesity development.
