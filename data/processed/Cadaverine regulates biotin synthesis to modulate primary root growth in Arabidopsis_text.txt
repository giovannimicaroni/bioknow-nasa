SUMMARY
Cadaverine, a polyamine, has been linked to modiﬁcation of root growth architecture and response to envi-
ronmental stresses in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth
by cadaverine are largely unexplored. Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a mutation,
cadaverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3), which resulted in increased root-growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not
other polyamines. This mutation affects the BIO3-BIO1 biotin biosynthesis gene. Exogenous supply of biotin
and a pathway intermediate downstream of BIO1, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed this cadaverine
sensitivity phenotype. An in vitro enzyme assay showed cadaverine inhibits the BIO3-BIO1 activity. Further-
more, cadaverine-treated seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 of the
acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in decreased
accumulation of triacylglycerides. Taken together, these results revealed an unexpected role of cadaverine in
the regulation of biotin biosynthesis, which leads to modulation of primary root growth of plants.

INTRODUCTION
Cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane) is a polyamine associated
with environmental perception and modulation of biologi-
cal processes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In
plants, alterations in cadaverine levels induce changes in
root architecture (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991; Liu et al.,
2014; Niemi et al., 2002; Strohm et al., 2015), fresh weight
(Cassan, 2009; Tomar et al., 2013), and stress response (Aziz
et al., 1998; Cassan, 2009; Kuznetsov et al., 2007; Liu et al.,
2000; Shevyakova et al., 2001; Sziderics et al., 2010) with
implications in crop yield and environmental stress resis-
tance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016).
Cadaverine is produced by decarboxylation of lysine in
plastids (Bunsupa et al., 2012), a process that has been
shown to be upregulated by environmental stresses,
including heat, drought, and salt stress, in ice plant
(Kuznetsov et al., 2007; Shevyakova et al., 2001), pepper
(Sziderics et al., 2010), and maize (Simon-Sarkadi et al.,
2014). On the other hand, free cadaverine levels are below
the limit of detection in Arabidopsis thaliana (Bunsupa
et al., 2012; Shimizu et al., 2019). However, all plants can
accumulate cadaverine directly from their environment, in
the form of molecules secreted by microbes from the phyl-
losphere, rhizosphere or endosphere, or diffusing from
decomposing matter (Cassan, 2009). Importantly, both
endogenous cadaverine and exogenously applied cadaver-
ine can modulate plant growth and environment-related
stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016). A.
thaliana seedlings exposed to exogenous cadaverine dis-
play altered root-growth behavior, clearly indicating a role
for this compound in root-growth regulation (Strohm
et al., 2015).

Similar to other polyamines, cadaverine catabolism pro-
duces hydrogen peroxide and other derived compounds,
which serve as transducers in a variety of physiological,
developmental, and environmental stress responses in ani-
mals, plants, and microbes. In Leguminosae, cadaverine is
a precursor for quinolizidine alkaloids, which act to deter
insects (Bunsupa et al., 2012). Much of the polyamine con-
tent within plant cells has been shown to be in the conju-
gated
form
(Torrigiani
et
al.,
1987).
Cadaverine
can
conjugate to lignin precursors, although other acceptors of
conjugation are possible (Negrel et al., 1992).
Despite these important roles of cadaverine in a broad
aspect of plant development and physiology, very little is
known about the molecular mechanisms that modulate
plant responses to cadaverine. To date, three cadaverine-
response genes have been identiﬁed in A. thaliana: OCT1,
PAO4, and SPMS (Liu et al., 2014; Strohm et al., 2015). OCT1
encodes an organic cation transporter previously implicated
in carnitine transport (Lelandais-Briere et al., 2007; Strohm
et al., 2015). PAO4, on the other hand, encodes a polyamine
oxidase that functions in the back-conversion of spermine
into spermidine, and spermidine into putrescine (Liu et al.,
2014). SPMS encodes a spermine synthase.
To understand this process better, we carried out a for-
ward genetic screen in A. thaliana, seeking mutations that
affect root-growth responses to exogenous cadaverine.
This screen revealed biotin as a possible target for the
cadaverine-induced pathway. In addition, the named vita-
min B7 or H, biotin is an essential cofactor that functions
in carboxylation reactions associated with de novo fatty
acid biosynthesis and amino acid homeostasis (Alban
et al., 2000).
In both plants and fungi, biotin synthesis starts with the
conversion of pimeloyl-coenzyme A (pimeloyl-CoA) to 7-
keto-8-aminoperlargonic acid (KAPA), which is catalyzed
by the cytosol- and peroxisome-localized KAPA synthase
enzyme (encoded by the BIO4 gene in Arabidopsis) (Pinon,
2005; Tanabe et al., 2011). Subsequent reactions occur in
the mitochondria, and produce 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid
(DAPA), dethiobiotin (DTB), and ﬁnally biotin. These reac-
tions are catalyzed by the DAPA synthase (BIO1), DTB syn-
thase
(BIO3),
and
biotin
synthase
(BIO2)
enzymes,
respectively (Cobessi et al., 2012; Muralla et al., 2007; Pic-
ciocchi et al., 2001; Shellhammer and Meinke, 1990). In
plants and fungi, BIO1 and BIO3 form a bifunctional,
homodimeric enzyme that is encoded by a single gene
(Arabidopsis BIO3-BIO1, At5G57590) (Muralla et al., 2007).
In Arabidopsis, ﬁve carboxylases have been shown to
use biotin as a cofactor: acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase;
which catalyzes the ﬁrst step in de novo fatty acid
biosynthesis) (Sasaki et al., 1993; Yanai et al., 1995),
3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCCase; which con-
tributes to leucine catabolism) (Alban et al., 1993; Song
et al., 1994), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (an enzyme that
functions at the intersection between fatty acid, amino acid,
and sugar metabolism pathways) (Wurtele and Nikolau,
1990), geranoyl-CoA carboxylase (Guan et al., 1999), and
pyruvate carboxylase (a key contributor to gluconeogenesis
and lipogenesis) (Wurtele and Nikolau, 1990; reviewed in
Nikolau et al., 2003). A role for biotin beyond its function as
a cofactor in carboxylases has also been suggested (Che,
2003), as has its potential contribution to the regulation of
expression of defense-related genes (Li et al., 2012). Fur-
thermore, an uncharacterized nuclear-localized biotinylated
protein has also been identiﬁed as potential regulator of
target gene expression (Li et al., 2012).
In this work, we show that cadaverine modulates pri-
mary root growth, mainly, by altering the biotin metabolic
pathway in A. thaliana. Cadaverine-induced inhibition of
root growth can be rescued with supplementation of biotin
and biotin-pathway intermediates downstream of BIO1.
Furthermore, we observed that decreased biotinylation of
ACCase subunit BCCP1, as a result of cadaverine treat-
ment, leads to a reduction of fatty acid synthesis. This
study will contribute toward understanding how biotin lim-
itation affects plant growth, and the role of cadaverine as a
natural biotin inhibitor.
RESULTS
cdh3 mutation enhances primary root growth sensitivity
to cadaverine in Arabidopsis
To identify molecular candidates in cadaverine response in
plants, we carried out a forward genetic screen using a popu-
lation of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized A. thali-
ana plants in the Columbia-0 (Col-0) background. We
screened M2 seedlings for altered root growth on media
containing 200 µM cadaverine. One of the cadaverine-
hypersensitive mutants identiﬁed in this screen, named ca-
daverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3), showed a signiﬁcant inhibi-
tion of primary root growth on cadaverine-containing media
relative to wild type (Figure 1a and Figure S1). This mutant is
the main subject of investigation in this manuscript.
Cadaverine decreases primary root growth earlier in the
cdh3 mutant than the wild type
To characterize cdh3 further, we ﬁrst plated wild-type and
cdh3 mutant seeds on media containing cadaverine, rang-
ing from 2 µM to 2 mM, and quantiﬁed primary root growth
under these conditions. The results demonstrated a strong
inhibitory effect of cadaverine at concentrations as low as
2 µM for cdh3, whereas a signiﬁcant effect of cadaverine on
wild-type root growth was observed only at concentrations
of 20 µM and higher (Figure 1b). At 20 µM cdh3 primary
roots were 58.4% shorter than wild type. On control media
lacking cadaverine, cdh3 seedlings showed only a minor
decrease in primary root growth compared with wild type
(Figure 1a).

In previous work involving wild-type Ler seedlings,
Strohm et al. showed that exogenous cadaverine inhibits
primary root growth mostly by affecting cell elongation
(Strohm et al., 2015). They also demonstrated the existence
of substantial natural variation between Arabidopsis acces-
sions in their primary root growth responses to exogenous

Cadaverine inhibits biotin synthesis

cadaverine (Strohm et al., 2015). Therefore, we tested the
effects of exogenous cadaverine on wild-type Col-0, analyz-
ing cell elongation and apical root meristem size. Eight-
day-old seedlings were grown on 200 µM cadaverine or
control media, and roots were treated with propidium
iodide, a cell-wall stain (Strohm et al., 2015), to determine
cell sizes and zone boundaries in the root tip. The decrease
in primary root growth was found to be mostly associated
with alterations in cell size within the elongation zone (Fig-
ure S2), whereas the number of cells in the root apical
meristem was not substantially affected in the wild type
(Figure 1c–e). However, cdh3 showed a signiﬁcantly smal-
ler root meristem upon cadaverine treatment, while cdh3
grown on control media showed an equal number of cells
compared with wild type. In addition to decreased cell divi-
sion and cell expansion in cdh3, propidium iodide perme-
ated a
number of
cells within the elongation zone,
suggesting cell death (Figure 1c).
We next wanted to determine the time at which cell
elongation is modiﬁed following cadaverine treatment by
measuring changes in tip growth over time. Five-day-old
seedlings were transferred on to split agar plates contain-
ing control or 200 µM cadaverine media and imaged for
4 days using a high-resolution camera. Wild-type roots
began to show a signiﬁcant decrease in tip growth after
96 h of cadaverine treatment. cdh3, on the other hand,
showed a decrease in root tip growth already 40 h after
onset of cadaverine treatment (Figure 1f). Therefore, the
cdh3 mutation substantially increases the speed of root-tip
response to exogenous cadaverine.
Because arginine-derived polyamines, such as putres-
cine and putrescine-derived spermidine and spermine,
were previously shown to also affect primary root growth
in young Arabidopsis seedlings, we tested ability of cdh3
to respond to these polyamines as well (Liu et al., 2014;
Strohm et al., 2015). The results demonstrated that cdh3
and wild type show similar root-growth response to
putrescine and spermine, with cdh3 showing only a mild
resistance to 500 µM spermidine (Figure 1g). Hence, the
cdh3 mutation increases root-growth sensitivity to cadav-
erine, and it has little to no effect on root responses to
putrescine and putrescine-derived polyamines.
Taken together, our data indicate that cdh3 alters a
mechanism involved in the control of primary root growth
in response to cadaverine, a process that targets the regu-
lation of anisotropic cell expansion occurring in the main
elongation zone as well as the meristem.
cdh3’s enhanced cadaverine response is the result of a
mutation in BIO3-BIO1
To evaluate the genetic makeup of cdh3, we backcrossed it
to Col-0, and self-pollinated the corresponding F1. Segregat-
ing F2 progeny were investigated for root-growth sensitivity
to cadaverine. Results showed 22.6% seedlings (12 of 53)
exhibiting hypersensitive cadaverine response, consistent
with a single, recessive mutation (chi-squared value of
0.1179; P ~ 0.3). To clone CDH3, we generated a pool of 162
cadaverine-hypersensitive cdh3 F2 seedlings from this seg-
regating population, extracted DNA from this pool, and sub-
jected it to whole genome next-generation sequencing. The
candidate mutation was mapped to a 4.6 Mb region of chro-
mosome 5, using the approach described in Schneeberger
et al. (2009). Within this region, a non-synonymous mutation
was found within the BIO3-BIO1 gene (At5G57590), which
encodes a bifunctional enzyme involved in biotin synthesis
(Cobessi et al., 2012). This mutation resulted in an A662T
amino acid change within the BIO1 catalytic pocket of the
protein (Figure 2a,b), which functions as an aminotrans-
ferase that catalyzes the conversion of KAPA into DAPA
within the pathway. The A662 amino acid is located in close
proximity to the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-cofactor binding
site, potentially affecting enzymatic activity (Figure 2c).
To
conﬁrm
the
association
of
the
cadaverine-
hypersensitive phenotype of cdh3 with the A662T mutation
in BIO3-BIO1, we transformed a wild-type BIO3-BIO1 trans-
gene under the control of its native promoter into cdh3. Four
independent, homozygous transgenic lines (cdh3 [BIO3-
BIO1pro::BIO3-BIO1])
were
recovered
and
screened
on
cadaverine-containing media. Results shown in Figure 2d
demonstrated rescue of the cadaverine-hypersensitive phe-
notype of cdh3 by the wild-type BIO3-BIO1pro::BIO3-BIO1
transgene in all four independent lines. Furthermore, the
transgene also rescued the decreased root-growth phenotype
displayed by cdh3 on control media, suggesting the corre-
sponding A662T mutation in BIO3-BIO1 was also responsible
for cdh3 root-growth restriction on control media (Figure 1a).
While performing these transformation–rescue experi-
ments, we also noted that three of the four transforma-
tion–rescue lines (lines 1, 3, and 4) displayed increased
root-growth resistance to cadaverine, a phenotype that is
opposite to the hypersensitive response displayed by
cdh3. To determine if the transformation–rescue lines dis-
played increased transgene expression level, BIO3-BIO1
expression was quantiﬁed using reverse transcription (RT)-
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on 8-day-
old seedlings grown on control media. While no signiﬁcant
expression alterations were found between cdh3 and wild-
type seedlings, transformation–rescue lines displayed 4.5–
14.8-fold increases in BIO3-BIO1 expression relative to wild
type (Figure 2e). The level of root-growth insensitivity to
cadaverine correlated with increased expression in resis-
tant
transformation–rescue
lines
(R2 = 0.68).
Taken
together, these results suggest dosage of BIO3-BIO1 affects
the root-growth response to cadaverine.

rescued by application of exogenous biotin (Schneider
et al., 1989). To determine if cdh3’s hypersensitive root-
growth response to cadaverine is the result of decreased
biotin, we supplemented 200 lM cadaverine-containing
media with biotin at concentrations ranging from 10 to
100 nM
(Schneider
et
al.,
1989).
The
cadaverine-
hypersensitive phenotype displayed by cdh3 roots was res-
cued in a dose-dependent manner to near wild-type root
growth by addition of biotin (Figure 3a). In addition, the
inhibitory effect of cadaverine on wild-type root growth
was also suppressed by addition of 80 nM biotin to the
medium
(Figure 3a). These data
are compatible
with
cadaverine targeting the biotin pathway or modulating bio-
tin availability or function. Alternatively, cadaverine and
biotin could function through parallel pathways to modify
primary root growth.
To identify a step in the biotin synthesis pathway that
may be potentially affected by cadaverine, we tested inter-
mediate compounds of the biotin biosynthesis pathway for
their abilities to suppress root-growth response to cadaver-
ine. Figure 3b shows that addition of 1 lM DAPA, the pro-
duct of BIO1 activity, resulted in complete suppression of
cadaverine’s effects on root growth, whereas addition of
1 lM KAPA, the BIO1 substrate, did not. These results
suggest that BIO2, BIO3, and BIO4 functions are not
impaired by cadaverine. Rather, BIO1 enzymatic activity,
channeling of DAPA to the BIO3 active site, or KAPA’s
availability or transport, is/are inhibited by cadaverine.
As root-growth response to cadaverine can be alleviated by
biotin supplementation in both cdh3 and wild-type seedlings,
we tested if we could identify cadaverine-hypersensitive lines
that cannot be rescued by biotin, thereby identifying down-
stream
regulators
in
the
cadaverine-response
pathway.
ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 mutant, oct1-1, and
POLYAMINE OXIDASE 4 mutant, pao4-1, have been shown to
be hypersensitive to cadaverine (Liu et al., 2014; Strohm et al.,
2015). oct1 and pao4 mutants were tested for chemical rescue
on biotin- and cadaverine-containing media. As shown in Fig-
ure 3c,d oct1 and pao4 mutant roots no longer displayed
cadaverine hypersensitivity in the presence of biotin. Hence,
biotin appears to function downstream of, or parallel to,
OCT1 and PAO4 in the cadaverine-response pathway.
Cadaverine directly modulates biotin synthesis by altering
BIO3-BIO1 enzymatic activity
As the results of the chemical rescue experiment suggest
that cadaverine may target DAPA synthase, we expressed
wild-type BIO3-BIO1 recombinant protein in vitro to test

et al., 2007). We set up in vitro reactions in the presence or
absence of cadaverine to determine whether cadaverine
alters the enzyme activity. The result shown in Figure 4a
indicates less formation of DTB in reactions containing
cadaverine compared with control. The data suggest that
cadaverine affects the ﬂow of molecules through the biotin
synthesis pathway at the level of DAPA or DTB synthesis,
leading to decreased biotin synthesis and altered root
growth. Attempts to express the cdh3 mutant protein
in vitro were unsucessful, suggesting the A662T mutation
may affect BIO3-BIO1 protein stability.
BIO3-BIO1 transcript and protein are unaffected by
cadaverine treatment
To determine if cadaverine also affects the regulation of
BIO3-BIO1 expression, we next quantiﬁed the levels of
BIO3-BIO1 transcripts in control and cadaverine-treated
wild-type and cdh3 seedlings. RNA was extracted from
whole
seedlings
germinated
on
cadaverine-containing
media, or treated with cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h, along
with controls grown on cadaverine-free medium. No signif-
icant
differences
were
identiﬁed
between
cadaverine-
treated and control samples, or between cdh3 and wild-
type seedlings (Figure 4b). In addition, cadaverine did not
inﬂuence the expression of other biotin synthesis genes,
BIO4 (At5G04620) and BIO2 (At2G43360) (Figure S3). This
result
contrasts
with
an
earlier
report
that
showed
increased BIO2 expression upon biotin depletion (Patton
et al., 1996). Together, these data suggest that cadaverine-
induced inhibition of biotin synthesis under our conditions
is not sufﬁciently severe to result in increased BIO2 expres-
sion.
To investigate a potential effect of cadaverine on BIO3-
BIO1 protein abundance, wild-type, cdh3, and cdh3 [BIO3-
BIO1pro::BIO3-BIO1] rescue line #2 were germinated and
grown on either control or cadaverine-containing media
for
8 days.
Proteins
were
extracted
from
dissected
root and shoot tissues, separated by sodium dodecyl sul-
fate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to
Western blot analysis, probing with a BIO3-BIO1-speciﬁc
antibody (Cobessi et al., 2012). The cdh3 [BIO3-BIO1pro::
BIO3-BIO1] rescue line expressed increased amounts of
BIO3-BIO1 protein relative to wild type, irrespective of
cadaverine
treatment
(Figure 4c),
consistent
with
its
increased
BIO3-BIO1
transcripts
(Figure 2e).
Minimal
differences in relative BIO3-BIO1 protein abundance were
observed between cadaverine-treated and control samples
for all genotypes and tissues tested (Figure 4c), suggesting
that cadaverine has limited impacts on overall expression
of the BIO3-BIO1 protein in Arabidopsis.
Cadaverine treatment decreases the biotinylation of biotin
carboxyl carrier proteins in planta
Considering that cadaverine inhibits biotin synthesis, we
hypothesized that treating Arabidopsis seedlings with
cadaverine should result in decreased biotinylation of tar-
get proteins in plant tissues. Previous studies have shown
that probing Western blot membranes with a streptavidin
probe allows the detection of a minimum of three biotiny-
lated plant proteins, including MCCA, involved in amino
acid metabolism, and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein 1
and 2 subunits (BCCP1 and BCCP2) of chloroplastic, het-
erodimeric ACCase, involved in fatty acid metabolism
(Aubert et al., 1996; Che, 2003; Li et al., 2012). BCCP2 is pri-
marily expressed in ﬂowers and developing seeds, but
scarcely detectable in seedling tissues (Thelen et al., 2001).
We used a similar Western blot analysis to determine
whether cadaverine treatment is sufﬁcient to induce differ-
ences in MCAA and/or BCCP proteins biotinylation in dis-
sected root and/or shoot tissues.
Wild-type, cdh3, and cdh3 [BIO3-BIO1pro::BIO3-BIO1] #2
rescue seedlings were germinated and grown on control
or cadaverine-containing media for 8 days. Roots and
shoots were then dissected. Proteins extracted from these
samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using a
streptavidin probe. The amounts of biotinylated MCCA
protein showed little change upon cadaverine treatment in
the root (Figure 5a,c) or shoot (Figure 5b,d). On the other
hand, a decrease in biotinylated BCCP1 protein was
observed in both roots (Figure 5a,e) and shoots (Figure 5b,
f), with a larger magnitude of decrease occurring in the
roots.
Cadaverine-induced
changes
in
biotinylated
protein
abundance could be due to decreased levels of target pro-
tein biotinylation, and/or relate to changes in abundance of
the corresponding proteins. To investigate these possibili-
ties, we used MCCA- and BCCP1-speciﬁc antibodies to ana-
lyze the abundance of these proteins in control and
cadaverine-treated seedlings. Results shown in Figure 5c
demonstrated increased MCCA levels in the root upon
cadaverine treatment only in cdh3, while no signiﬁcant
changes were observed in the shoot (Figure 5d). BCCP1
protein abundance in cadaverine-treated samples relative
to controls, showed no signiﬁcant changes in the root or
shoot (Figure 5e,f).
qRT-PCR analysis of MCCA and BCCP1 expression
showed no signiﬁcant transcriptional alteration in cdh3
and Col-0 upon cadaverine treatment, whether applied
since germination, or for 24, 48, or 72 h (Figure S4). Taken

Cadaverine inhibits biotin synthesis
1289

together, our data are consistent with cadaverine treatment
leading to decreased biotin synthesis, thereby resulting in
decreased biotinylation in BCCP1 protein in both shoots
and roots. They are also consistent with decreased biotiny-
lation levels of MCCA protein in cdh3 mutant roots, as
increased MCCA apoprotein abundance is not accompa-
nied by increased levels of biotinylated MCCA (Figure 5c).
In summary, cadaverine treatment signiﬁcantly affects
the amount of biotinylated BCCP1 protein in both shoots
and roots.
Lipid composition is altered by cadaverine
ACCase requires biotinylation of the BCCP1 subunit to gen-
erate malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA at the ﬁrst step of fatty
acid biosynthesis. The cadaverine-induced reduction in
biotinylated BCCP1 protein in plant tissues is expected to
decrease fatty acid production. To test this hypothesis, we
determined the impact of cadaverine treatment on the lipid
proﬁle of Arabidopsis seedlings. Wild-type Col-0 seeds
were germinated and grown on control media for 5 days,
then transferred to either control media or media contain-
ing 200 µM cadaverine, and allowed to grow for 72 more
hours, a time previously determined to be sufﬁcient to
allow
primary
root
growth
inhibition
by
cadaverine
(Figure 1). At that time, lipids were extracted from these
samples, and subjected to lipidomics analyses by tandem
mass spectrometry (Shiva et al., 2013). Total polar lipids as
well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG)
lipids, were analyzed with ﬁve biological replicates.
The results showed that total TAG decreased in abun-
dance upon cadaverine treatment, with six of 31 TAG spe-
cies showing signiﬁcant decreases (Figure 6), all of which
were TAGs having 18:3 acyls. On the other hand, TAGs
containing short-chain fatty acids, 16:0 and 16:1, had little
changes with the treatment (Figure 6). The reduced TAG
synthesis along with the higher percentage of short-chain
fatty acid compositions in TAGs were also previously
observed in Arabidopsis plants with limited biotin avail-
ability (Pommerrenig et al., 2012). Therefore, these results
are consistent with the negative effect of cadaverine on
biotin availability and TAG production.
We observed similar levels of total polar lipid species
between cadaverine-treated and control seedlings, with
slight decreases observed in total PA and phosphatidyli-
nositol (PI), and an increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC)
(Table S1). Although total DAG levels were not altered by
cadaverine treatment, speciﬁc DAGs changed in abun-
dance in response to cadaverine, including increases in

membrane was exposed to a BIO3-BIO1-speciﬁc antibody to determine protein level. An antibody directed against a proteasomal protein, RPT4A was also used
as a loading control. Blot shown here is representative of three biological replicates that gave similar results. In each blot, band intensities were quantiﬁed and
standardized to RPT4A for each lane. Results of these quantiﬁcations are plotted in the graph shown to the right of the blot, with the value of each biological

Cadaverine inhibits biotin synthesis

DAG 16:0/16:1, DAG 18:0/16:2 and DAG 18:3/dnOPDA, and
decreases in DAG 18:3/18:3 content (Table S1). In addition,
we have also seen modiﬁcation of phospholipids, albeit
below the signiﬁcance threshold, with PI and PA decreas-
ing with cadaverine treatment.
DISCUSSION
We have shown that cadaverine functions to inhibit pri-
mary root growth by modulating biotin synthesis through
inhibition of the BIO3-BIO1 enzyme. Cadaverine response
can be chemically rescued with biotin, DAPA, but not
KAPA. While KAPA could potentially be excluded from
transport into seedlings, the results of our in vitro reaction
show cadaverine to inhibit BIO3-BIO1 activity. Further-
more, cadaverine did not alter the expression of BIO3-BIO1
at the protein level in wild-type or cdh3, and overexpres-
sion of BIO3-BIO1 from our cdh3 rescue line resulted in
increased BIO3-BIO1 protein and resistance to cadaverine,
in agreement with an effect on BIO3-BIO1 enzymatic func-
tion.
Analysis of the BIO3-BIO1 mutant, cdh3, reported here
shows biotin deﬁciency results in decreased primary root
growth, which is similar to the phenotype observed in the
hypomorphic mutation in BIO4 (Li et al., 2012). Further-
more,
analysis
of
cdh3
root
growth
on
cadaverine-
containing media also shows evidence of cell death in the
elongation zone upon staining with propidium iodide (Fig-
ure 1c). Evidence of cell death was also reported in shoots
of a hypomorphic mutant of BIO4 (Li et al., 2012), indicat-
ing that decreases in biotin cause cell death in both roots
and shoots. The localization of cell death to the elongation
zone of cadaverine-treated cdh3 may reﬂect an increased
requirement for biotin in tissues that undergo rapid cell
growth and expansion. Alternatively, deﬁciencies in fatty
acid synthesis have been shown to result in an accumula-
tion of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria, along
with cell death (Wu et al., 2015). The similar phenotypes
observed in cadaverine-treated cdh3 mutant seedlings (this
study) and biotin-deﬁcient mutants (Li et al., 2012; Wu
et al., 2015) thus suggest that a deﬁciency in biotin synthe-
sis may underlie the developmental impact of cadaverine.
Inhibition of biotin synthesis has long been a target for
herbicides and antibiotics. While numerous compounds
have been identiﬁed to inhibit biotin biosynthesis, to date
only one natural product, amiclenomycin, had been identi-
ﬁed to inhibit DAPA synthase in bacteria, through forma-
tion of a covalent adduct with PLP (Sandmark et al., 2002).
Our results indicate cadaverine is a natural DAPA synthase
inhibitor in Arabidopsis. Cadaverine may function to inhibit
BIO3-BIO1 through formation of a Schiff base with PLP, as
observed with amiclenomycin, or through direct interac-
tion with the binding site. BIO3-BIO1 inhibition by cadaver-
ine cannot be mimicked by treatments with putrescine
and/or putrescine-derived polyamines. The different inhibi-
tory activities displayed by distinct polyamines may be
determined by charge distribution of the amine groups or
subcellular compartmentalization. Given the proximity of
A662 to PLP, the hypersensitive response of cdh3 mutant
to cadaverine could be explained by an altered conforma-
tion of the mutant protein resulting in decreased reaction
efﬁciency. However, multiple attempts at producing recom-
binant cdh3 mutant enzyme failed, preventing us from
directly testing this hypothesis. Future work will be aimed
at characterizing cadaverine’s inhibitory effect on DAPA
synthase activity in plants.
As we have shown exogenous biotin rescues the cadav-
erine response phenotype, the effect of cadaverine treat-
ment on primary root growth is in part associated with

induced
alterations
in
lipid
composition,
including
decreased TAG content, and/or signaling phospholipids.
Analysis of SUC5, required for biotin transport into the
developing embryo from the maternal plant, shows the
suc5 and bio1 or bio2 double mutants rescued with exoge-
nous biotin have an increased proportion of short chain
fatty acids (16:0 and 16:1), in accordance with our observa-
tion of cadaverine treatment (Figure 6; Table S1) (Pommer-
renig et al., 2012). The decrease in PI and PA could be due
to increased activity through the phosphoinositide path-
way to generate DAG to compensate for decreases in TAG.
Alternatively, cadaverine may function to affect the compo-
nents of the phosphoinositide pathway, independently
from its effect on biotin, contributing to the root growth
phenotype we see in response to cadaverine.
Biotin is also involved in amino acid homeostasis, gluco-
neogenesis, and other aspects of central metabolism.
MCCase has previously been shown to accumulate in
response to biotin depletion or starvation to allow for recy-
cling of amino acids (Aubert et al., 1996; Che, 2003; Ding
et al., 2012). The increase of MCCA apoprotein in cdh3 (Fig-
ure 5a,c) is compatible with a mechanism that allows mod-
ulation of target MCCA protein abundance by biotin
availability, in agreement with previous studies (Che, 2003;
Li et al., 2012). The absence of such changes in cadaverine-
treated wild-type plants may simply reﬂect a lower level of
biotin limitation in wild-type roots.
While root growth inhibition of cdh3 was not observed
with putrescine-derived polyamines (Figure 1g), the pao4
phenotype and subsequent rescue by biotin (Figure 3d)
suggests
a
connection
between
cadaverine
and
the
putrescine-derived polyamines. Polyamine oxidases, such
as PAO4, oxidize polyamines spermidine and spermine,
thereby
contributing
to
putrescine-derived
polyamines
homeostasis (Kamada-Nobusada et al., 2008; Liu et al.,
2014). pao4 mutants show increased spermine content,
decreased
spermidine
and
hydrogen
peroxide,
and
changes in primary metabolism (Sequera-Mutiozabal et al.,
2016). Altered primary metabolism associated with the
pao4
mutation
may
reﬂect
an
indirect
role
for
the
putrescine-derived polyamines or their catabolic products
in biotin synthesis or the downstream effects of biotin.
The putrescine-derived polyamines are essential compo-
nents for growth and development; for example, thermo-
spermine is required for vasculature development in
Arabidopsis
(Kakehi
et
al.,
2008)
and
spermidine
is
required for eukaryotic translation (Park et al., 1982). Stud-
ies on the functions of putrescine-derived polyamines have
been hampered by the embryo lethality associated with
spermidine depletion (Imai et al., 2004). Therefore, it is
possible that putrescine-derived polyamines provide other
essential roles that have yet to be uncovered.
OCT1 has been characterized as a carnitine transporter
and
was
proposed
to
transport
cations,
such
as
polyamines (Lelandais-Briere et al., 2007; Strohm et al.,
2015). In mammals the carnitine cycle allows acyl transport
into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. An analogous
mechanism has been proposed in plants after identiﬁca-
tion of a carnitine acyl carrier-like protein with homology
to mammalian carnitine acyl carrier, but the role of car-
nitine in plants has yet to be further elucidated (Lawand
et al., 2002). oct1 mutants could be sensitive to cadaverine
because of altered polyamines homeostasis and/or local-
ization. Alternatively, cadaverine-induced lipid deﬁciency
could be exacerbated by altered acyl transport capabilities
in the oct1 mutants.
In some plants, cadaverine abundance has been found
to increase in response to environmental stress, a pro-
cess that is believed to contribute to stress mitigation.
Furthermore,
microbes
from
the
phyllosphere,
rhizo-
sphere, or endosphere have also been shown to provide
plants with cadaverine, as does decomposing matter in
proximity of a root system (Cassan, 2009). Both endoge-
nous and exogenously applied cadaverine can modulate
plant growth and environment-related stress resistance
(reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016). We present here that
cadaverine inhibits biotin biosynthesis and primary meta-
bolism in Arabidopsis through direct inhibition of DAPA
synthase, thereby reducing the accumulation of TAGs. If
the physiological responses to cadaverine are adaptive,
the presence of cadaverine, either through association
with microbes (in most plants including A. thaliana) or
through stress-induced synthesis, where observed, may
serve
to
divert
a
plant’s
resources
from
growth
to
defense responses. Future investigations addressing the
conservation of cadaverine-response pathways in plants,
and the development of methods aimed at better control-
ling the effects of cadaverine on biotin synthesis, its
impact on primary metabolism within the biomass, and
on root-system architecture, should yield important new
insights, facilitating the development of new crop vari-
eties with improved productivity, enhanced energy con-
tent of the biomass, and increased adaptability to the
stresses associated with climate change or growth on
marginal lands.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Seedling root growth measurements
Seedlings were grown on plates containing 1.5% agar, 0.59
Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) media pH 5.7 with 1.5% sucrose unless
otherwise
noted.
After
48 h
of
stratiﬁcation,
plates
were
moved to a 22°C growth chamber under long day conditions,
60 lmol m–2 sec–1 white light (cool-white ﬂuorescent bulbs) and
the wave assay was carried out as described in Rutherford and
Masson (1996). Day lengths were 16 h. After 6 days of growth, the
position of the root tip was marked and seedlings were grown for
4 more days. After 10 days, plates were scanned using a docu-
ment scanner and the growth from Day 6 to 10 was measured

using the Neuron J plugin of ImageJ. Root growth was standard-
ized to the control of each mutant line.
To determine if the response was speciﬁc to cadaverine, mutant
lines were screened on media supplemented with putrescine (5,
10, and 15 mM), spermidine (300, 500, and 700 lM), and spermine
(200, 300, and 400 lM), and root growth measurements were car-
ried out as described above.
Meristem morphology and cell size
Zeiss confocal LSM780 microscope was used to characterize cell
size and morphology of cadaverine-treated roots. Eight-day-old
seedlings
were
germinated
on
control
media
or
200 lM
cadaverine-containing media. Seedlings were grown as described
above. After 8 days in the growth chamber, seedlings were
stained with 1.0 mg ml–1 propidium iodide for approximately
2 sec and then rinsed with water. Roots were imaged using a 561-
nm laser, 209 objective. Images were analyzed using ImageJ.
Meristem was deﬁned from the quiescent center to the ﬁrst elon-
gated cell in the cortex. The number of cells in the meristem was
counted from the quiescent center along ﬁles of cortical cells to
the ﬁrst elongated cell (Perilli et al., 2010). The cell length in the
mature zone was quantiﬁed by measuring cells in the epidermis
using ImageJ.
Root tip growth measurement
Seedlings were germinated on control media (as above) and
grown vertically to reduce waving. Three days after germination,
seedlings were transferred to control or 200 lM cadaverine-
containing media and grown under 60 lmol m–2 sec–1 of continu-
ous light. A high-resolution raspberry pi camera was used to
image seedlings every 8 h. Imaging began within 10 min after
transfer. ImageJ was used to measure tip growth every 8 h. Statis-
tical difference in root tip growth between cadaverine and control
treatment was tested using a mixed effects model with an F-test
for the interaction between time and treatment, corrected with
Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons in SAS Studio Ver-
sion 3.8 (Gueorguieva and Krystal, 2004).
Forward genetic screen
To generate an EMS population, approximately 0.19 g of Col-0
seeds (M0) were treated with 50 ml of 0.2% EMS for 15 h, then
rinsed with water eight times (Weigel and Glazebrook, 2002). On
the last wash, seeds were soaked in water for an hour. Seeds were
then resuspended in 0.1% agar and pipetted on to soil. After EMS
application M0 seeds are referred to as M1. M1 plants were self-
pollinated and M2 seeds were collected in individual pools for
each plant. In total, 1064 M2 lines were screened on plates con-
taining LS media supplemented with 200 lM cadaverine. Seed-
lings showing a hypersensitive response, a decrease in root
growth compared with the wild type on cadaverine media, were
self-pollinated and the M3 lines were rescreened on 200 lM cadav-
erine and control media. Root growth of these M3 lines was quan-
tiﬁed as described above. Student’s t-test was done against Col-0
to determine if the mutant line was hypersensitive to cadaverine
(Figure S1).
Next-generation sequencing
A mapping population of cdh3 was generated by backcrossing
cdh3 to wild-type Col-0. The segregating F2 population was
screened on 50 lM cadaverine plates as described above, omitting
sucrose. In total, 162 cadaverine hypersensitive seedlings were
pooled and frozen in liquid nitrogen, then homogenized with a
4.5-mm steel bead using Mixmill. DNA was extracted using the
QIAGEN DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Next-
generation sequencing was done using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (UW-
Biotech Facility) with 100 bp, paired-end reads. DNASTAR software
(version 12.3) was used for alignment and variant identiﬁcation.
Reads with a Q value <30 were removed from analysis. Variants
present in multiple EMS mutant lines and Col-0 were subtracted
from the cdh3 variant list. The location of the mutation was identi-
ﬁed by looking at the percentage single nucleotide polymorphism
along the position in the genome (Zuryn et al., 2010).
Chemical rescue
Seedlings were germinated on LS media with or without 200 lM
cadaverine and 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 nM biotin. Biotin was pre-
pared as described in Schneider et al. (1989). Seedling root
growth was quantiﬁed as described above. Student’s t-test was
done to determine signiﬁcance against Col-0 using P < 0.05 as a
cut off.
Transformation rescue
Primers containing adapters for Asc1 and Pac1 restriction sites
were used to amplify Col-0 wild-type BIO3-BIO1 genomic DNA
(At5G57590), from 1233 bp upstream from the transcriptional start
site to 382 bp 30 of the stop codon, yielding a 5706-bp product.
The PCR reaction was restriction-digested with Asc1 and Pac1 and
ligated into pMDC99 (Curtis, 2003). The ligated product was
transformed into Escherichia coli DUO competent cells (Lucigen,
Middleton, WI, USA) and selected on 50 lg ml–1 kanamycin.
Transformation rescue was done on the cdh3 mutant using the
ﬂoral dip method as described (Clough and Bent, 1998) using
Agrobacteria strain GV3101. T1 seeds were screened on 50 lg ml–1
hygromycin to identify positive transformants.
Protein expression and isolation
Protein
expression
of
pET-mBIO3-BIO1
was
carried
out
as
described previously (Cobessi et al., 2012). The plasmid was intro-
duced into Rosetta-2 E. coli competent cells (Novagen, Madison,
WI, USA) and cultured overnight at 37°C, 200 r.p.m. in 10 ml LB
medium containing 50 lg ml–1 kanamycin. After overnight growth
the culture was transferred into 500 ml LB with appropriate antibi-
otic and supplemented with 10 lM pyridoxine and 15 lM thiamin
(Cobessi et al., 2012). The culture was incubated at 37°C until the
OD600
reached
0.3.
At
this
point,
0.4 mM
isopropylthio-b-D-
galactoside was added, and the culture was grown for 16 h at
18°C, shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were then harvested by cen-
trifuged at 4°C for 20 min at 4000 g. Pellet was resuspend in lysis
buffer with additional 19 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) and 500 lM PLP. Cell lysate was centrifuged at
10 000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant was collected and sub-
jected to QIAexpress Ni-NTA column puriﬁcation (Qiagen). Eluted
protein was desalted using Amicon Ultra centrifugal ﬁlter units,
Ultra-15 MWCO 50 kDa (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA).
Protein was stored and diluted in 100 mM HEPPS pH 8.6.
BIO3-BIO1 in vitro enzymatic assay
The assay was modiﬁed from the method developed by Cobessi
et al. (2012). Reaction buffer contained the following: 100 mM
HEPPS pH 8.6, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM Ado-
Met, 10 mM NaHCO3, and 0.3 mM ATP. Each reaction included var-
ious concentrations of racemic hydrochloride-KAPA (synthesized
according to the procedure described by Nudelman et al. (2004) as
substrate
(0
or
20 µM),
along
with
0
or

dihydrochloride. The BIO3-BIO1 enzyme at a ﬁnal concentration of
6.9 µM was added to start the reactions. Reactions were run at
25°C for 8 min. At the end of each reaction, the enzyme was inacti-
vated by addition of 20% acetic acid. Inactivated enzyme was
removed from the reaction using a 10-kDa column (Pall NanoSep).
DTB was detected using FluoReporter Biotin Quantitation Assay
Kit (F30751; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Twenty-ﬁve
microliters of reaction product was mixed with 25 µl 29 Biotective
Green Reagent and incubated for 5 min in the dark before detec-
tion using a Tecan Inﬁnite M1000 Pro microplate reader with
495 nm (10 nm bandwidth) excitation and 530 nm (10 nm band-
width) emission. A standard curve of DTB was generated from 0
to 80 pmol and used to determine the amount of DTB per sample.
Seedling growth for gene expression analysis
Seedlings were germinated on control media and transferred to
plates containing control or 200 lM cadaverine media for 24, 48,
or 72 h before collecting tissue at 8 days after germination. An
additional subset of seedlings was germinated directly on control
or 200 lM cadaverine media. To harvest, seedlings were ﬂash fro-
zen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized using a 4.5-mm steel
bead and a Mixmill.
Gene expression analysis
RNA extraction was done using TRIzol reagent and Direct-zol RNA
MiniPrep Kit, with a chloroform phase separation, according to
manufacturer’s speciﬁcations (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA, USA).
cDNA synthesis was done using SuperScript III. qRT-PCR was done
using Bullseye EvaGreen qPCR Mastermix (MidSci) and run on a
LightCycler 480 II Instrument (Roche). Gene expression was calcu-
lated by the delta delta Ct method and standardized to the PP2A
(At1G59830) reference gene (Czechowski et al., 2005; Ramakers
et al., 2003). Fold-change of expression for all samples was then set
relative to a control sample. Statistical signiﬁcance was identiﬁed
by ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction (SAS version 9.3).
Protein analysis
Seedling growth is as described above, with seedlings germinated
on 1.5% agar, 0.59 LS media pH 5.7 with 1.5% sucrose with or with-
out or 200 lM cadaverine. Tissue was frozen using dry ice after
8 days of growth. Frozen samples were homogenized using Mix-
Mill. Protein was extracted in the equivalent of 1 ml of protein
extraction buffer (20 mM MOPS [pH 7.5], 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl,
50 mM Sucrose [Roche inhibitor cocktail tablet], 1 mM DTT, 7% glyc-
erol [adapted from (Li et al., 2012]) per 250 mg of tissue. The homo-
genate was gently mixed at 4°C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 4°C
for 30 min, 18 000 g to pellet the debris. Total protein was quanti-
ﬁed and standardized for each gel using the Roche BCA assay.
Approximately 150 lg of protein was loaded on to a 12% Tris-Bis
NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and run using the
Invitrogen X-cell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System. After
electroblotting, the Immunobilon-FL PVDF membrane was blocked
for 1 h at 4°C with a 5% milk/TBS solution (25 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM
NaCl, 3.0 mM KCl). Anti-RPT4A, a proteasome subunit-speciﬁc anti-
body generated in rabbit, was used as a loading control at 1:4000
dilution. BIO3-BIO1 antibody was generated against guinea pig by
Claude Alban and used at 1:25 000 (Cobessi et al., 2012). BCCP1
and MCCA antibodies were generated against rabbit by Basil Niko-
lau and obtained from the Plant Antibody Facility (PAF, Ohio State)
(Che, 2003; Li et al., 2011). MCCA and BCCP1 antibodies were used
at a concentration of 1:10 000. LiCor CW800, secondary antibodies
were used according to manufacturer’s instructions at 1:10 000
dilution. Membranes were scanned using LICOR Odyssey. Image
studio software version 5.2.5 and Adobe Photoshop was used to
quantify band intensity.
Biotin-containing protein analysis
Biotin-containing proteins were quantiﬁed following protocol from
Li et al. (2012). RPT4A loading control was used as described
above. Membranes were blocked in TBST with 1% Tween20
before treating with streptavidin. Streptavadin CW800 was used to
detect biotinylated proteins at a concentration of 0.5 µg ml–1 in
1% milk TBST.
Lipid proﬁling
Col-0 wild-type seedlings were grown on LS media as described
above. After 5 days in the growth chamber, seedlings were trans-
ferred to plates containing control or 200 lM cadaverine media,
and allowed to grow for an additional 72 h. Fresh tissue was sub-
merged immediately in 75°C isopropanol with 0.01% butylated
hydroxytoluene. Lipid extraction procedure was done according to
Devaiah et al. (2006). Samples were dried under nitrogen gas and
shipped to Kansas State Lipidomics Research Center for analysis
(Vu et al., 2014). Lipids were standardized to dry weight for each
sample. Total acyl lipids, DAG and TAG were analyzed on a
Waters Xevo TQS mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).
Samples contained 200 seedlings per biological replica, with a
total of ﬁve biological repeats.

Figure S1. Thirteen cadaverine hypersensitive mutants (cdh1–
cdh13) were
identiﬁed
by screening
for alterations
in
root
responses to cadaverine. Root growth from day 6 to day 10 was
measured on cadaverine and control media. Each mutant line was
standardized to growth on control media, and standardized again
to growth of the wild type. cdh mutants 1–7 fall into distinct com-
plementation groups. Other mutants were not included in this
genetic
complementation
test.

minimum to maximum values.
Figure S2. Cadaverine decreases cell elongation. (a) Seedlings
were germinated on 200 lM cadaverine or control media and pro-
pidium iodide treatment was used to stain the cell walls. Stained
roots were then analyzed using confocal microscopy. Five seed-
lings were analyzed per treatment group. Cell length in the mature
zone was analyzed using the same treatment conditions described
in Figure 1. (b) Length of epidermal cells in the mature zone was
quantiﬁed for each treatment described in (a). Statistical differ-
ences were deﬁned by ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction with
similar letters indicating no statistical difference. Bars represent
standard error.
Figure S3. Expression of genes involved in biotin synthesis is
unaffected by cadaverine treatment. Wild-type and cdh3 seeds
were germinated on control media, with a subset germinated on
media containing 200 lM cadaverine. Seedlings were transferred
to 200 lM cadaverine-containing or control media for the indi-
cated duration, 24, 48, or 72 h post-transfer. A subset of seeds
(indicated as 8*) was germinated directly on control or 200 lM
cadaverine-containing
media.
Seedlings
were
collected
after
8 days in light. Twelve seedlings were collected per biological
replicate, and three biological replicates were generated per treat-
ment group. qRT-PCR was carried out using PP2A as a reference
gene. Bars indicate standard error with dots showing biological
replicates. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using ANOVA
with Tukey’s HSD correction. Similar letters indicate no signiﬁcant
