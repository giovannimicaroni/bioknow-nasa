SUMMARY
To understand the physiological changes that occur in response to spaceﬂight, mice
are transported to the International Space Station (ISS) and housed for variable pe-
riods of time before euthanasia on-orbit or return to Earth. Sample collection under
such difﬁcult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identiﬁed
and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues
dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized
on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preserva-
tion method eclipsed those between ﬂight and ground samples, making it difﬁcult
to identify spaceﬂight-speciﬁc changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the
roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library
preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are
exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection. This has important implications for
the interpretation of existing datasets and the design of future experiments.
INTRODUCTION
Spaceﬂightplacesmultiplestressesuponthehuman bodyincludingalteredgravityﬁeldsandexposuretocosmic
radiation, which lead to health risks for spacefaring humans (Institute of Medicine, 2008). Decades of research on
astronauts has begun to reveal how humans respond to the spaceﬂight environment (Garrett-Bakelman et al.,
2019) but physiological monitoring of astronauts is still limited. Thus, rodent models have been essential for
advancing our understanding of how mammals—including humans—respond to spaceﬂight. This includes the
impact of spaceﬂight on muscle structure (Shen et al., 2017; Spatz et al., 2017; Tascher et al., 2017), liver (Beheshti
et al., 2019; Jonscher et al., 2016), and immune functions (Pecaut et al., 2017; Rettig et al., 2017; Ward et al., 2018).
Despite success of the rodent model, sample collection under such difﬁcult conditions introduces confounding
factors that need to be identiﬁed and addressed. These are related to hardware limitations, small sample size,
and severe restraints on astronaut crew availability. Successful experiments must work within these constraints to
produce meaningful insights. In response, the ﬁrst Rodent Research (RR) mission established new capabilities for
conducting reliable long-duration experiments using rodents with on-orbit sample collection. Animals can either
be euthanized onboard the ISS or returned to Earth alive. Both approaches introduce confounding factors. The
former is experimentally challenging but preserves the sample during exposure to microgravity, whereas the
latter exposes the animal to re-entry stresses, and sampling occurs only after a variable lag between landing
and euthanasia—essentially sampling re-adaptation to Earth conditions in addition to the response to space-
ﬂight. Inconsistent handling of samples necessitates a clear understanding of how dissection and preservation
protocols affect downstream data generation.
We previously showed, using transcriptomic, proteomic, and immunohistochemical data from the Rodent
Research-1 (RR-1), Rodent Research-3 (RR-3), and Space Transportation System (STS)-135 missions, that lip-
otoxic pathways are activated in rodent liver in two different strains of mice that were ﬂown for as long as
42 days in space (Beheshti et al., 2019). Because animals in the RR-1 and RR-3 experiments were euthanized
in space, this work suggested that space alone was the most likely cause for similar changes previously
observed in liver samples from mice ﬂown during the STS-135 experiments where animals returned alive

to Earth (Jonscher et al., 2016). The lipotoxic effect is stronger with duration and may have ramiﬁcations for
astronauts’ health during long missions. This analysis did not include two ﬂight and two ground animals
from RR-1, as these animals were dissected immediately after euthanasia on-orbit as opposed to the
rest, which were ﬁrst returned to Earth as intact frozen carcasses for later dissection.
Here we now compare RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) datasets generated from livers preserved using these distinct
protocols (Table 1). We ﬁnd large changes in the transcriptome of tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit
compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved intact by freezing on-orbit, and dissected after
return to Earth. To identify and mediate how the preservation method could have such a large effect on differ-
ential gene expression (DGE) results, we performed follow-on experiments to interrogate the role of euthanasia
methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods on DGE changes. Our ﬁnd-
ings have important implications for interpreting existing datasets and the design of future experiments.
RESULTS
Preservation Method Is the Primary Driver of Gene Expression Variance in RR-1 Liver
Samples
To assess gene expression differences in liver samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission (Cadena
et al., 2019; Globus and Galazka, 2015; Ronca et al., 2019), RNA was extracted from livers dissected from
spaceﬂight (FLT) and ground control (GC) animals either immediately after euthanasia (immediate preser-
vation, I) or from frozen carcasses after partial thawing (carcass preservation, C) and sequenced following
polyA selection (Figure S1). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed preservation method (C versus I)
as the primary driver of variance among samples rather than spaceﬂight (FLT versus GC) (Figure 1A).
Furthermore, there was an order of magnitude difference in the number of differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) identiﬁed in FLT versus GC carcass samples than was observed in FLT versus GC immediate sam-
ples, and only 4 DEGs overlapped between the two preservation methods (Figure 1B). Gene set enrichment
analysis of FLT versus GC immediate- (Figure 2A) and carcass-derived (Figure 2B) samples showed no over-
lap in enriched gene ontology (GO) terms (Figure 2C), showing that any gene expression changes in the
liver as a result of spaceﬂight exposure were confounded by the sample preservation method used.
Since livers from only 2 FLT and 2 GC animals in the RR-1 NASA Validation mission were preserved via the
immediate method, RNA from livers prepared via the immediate method from two additional studies, the
RR-1 CASIS mission (Figure S1) (Cadena et al., 2019; Globus et al., 2015; Ronca et al., 2019) and a ground-
based preservation and storage study (Figure S2) (Choi et al., 2016; GeneLab, 2016), were also sequenced
following polyA selection. Despite multiple different experimental factors in RR-1 NASA, RR-1 CASIS, and
the ground-based preservation studies, PCA continued to show preservation method as the primary driver
of variance among samples in these datasets (Figure S3).
Carcass-Preserved Samples Exhibit Less Uniform Transcript Coverage than Immediate-
Preserved Samples
To further investigate the observed differences in preservation method, RR-1 NASA FLT and GC liver sam-
ples derived from the carcass preservation method were grouped together (C) and FLT and GC liver sam-
ples derived from the immediate preservation method were grouped together (I). DGE was evaluated in
carcass versus immediate samples. Many more genes were differentially expressed in carcass versus imme-
diate samples (2,934 DEGs) than in either FLT-C versus GC-C (619 DEGs) or in FLT-I versus GC-I (67 DEGs)
samples, further supporting preservation method as the primary driver of variance in RR-1 NASA liver sam-
ples (Figure 3A). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that several of the gene ontologies enriched in
carcass samples (when compared with immediate samples) involved RNA regulation and processing (Fig-
ure 3B). Despite similarly high RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values (Figure S4), carcass samples exhibited
signiﬁcantly less 50 to 30 gene body coverage than immediate samples as indicated by their 50 to 30 transcript
integrity ratios. The 50 to 30 transcript integrity ratios were determined by dividing the percent coverage
indicated in the 50-shaded region by that in the 30-shaded region for each sample (Figures 3C and D).
Expression of Genes Involved in 50-Methylguanosine Decapping and PolyA Removal Is
Affected by Preservation Condition
Given the differences in gene body coverage between carcass and immediate samples, we evaluated the
expression of 50-methylguanosine decapping and polyA removal genes in these groups from the RNAseq

data. In mammals, eight genes have decapping activity in vitro and/or in cells: Dcp2 (Nudt20), Nudt3,
Nudt16, Nudt2, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, Nudt19. In addition, Dxo acts on partially capped mRNAs (Grud-
zien-Nogalska and Kiledjian, 2017). Two of these genes—Dxo and Nudt2—were signiﬁcantly more ex-
pressed in the carcass samples, whereas another two—Nudt15 and Dcp2 (Nudt20)—were signiﬁcantly
more expressed in immediate samples (Figure S5). Removal of polyA tails from mRNA is catalyzed by
two complexes. The ﬁrst, CCR4-NOT, consists of CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT9, CNOT10,
CNOT6, CNOT6L, CNOT7, and CNOT8. The second, PAN2-PAN3, consists of PAN2 and PAN3 (Siwaszek

et al., 2014). In the case of the 10 subunit CCR4-NOT complex, we observed 5 genes that were more highly
expressed in the immediate group (Cnot1, Cnot2, Cnot9, Cnot6, Cnot6L) and 3 that were more highly ex-
pressed in the carcass group (Cnot3, Cnot10, Cnot7) (Figure 3E). In the case of the PAN2-PAN3 complex,
both Pan2 and Pan3 were more highly expressed in the carcass group (Figure 3E).
Samples Sequenced Following Ribodepletion Exhibit More Uniform Transcript Coverage
than Samples Prepared with PolyA Selection
The polyA selection library preparation method, which was initially used to evaluate gene expression dif-
ferences in RR-1 NASA Validation mission liver samples, requires intact RNA to minimize bias (Kumar et al.,
2017; Petrova et al., 2017). Because our data suggest that the carcass samples were more degraded than
the immediate samples (Figures 3C and 3D), the total RNA isolated from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission
carcass liver samples was used to prepare libraries with the ribodepletion method to minimize transcript
integrity bias, then re-sequenced. PCA showed a more distinct separation of FLT and GC carcass samples
when the samples were prepared via the ribodepletion method (Figure 4A) than by polyA selection (FLT-C
and GC-C samples in Figure 1A). DEGs were identiﬁed in FLT versus GC carcass samples prepared with the
ribodepletion method and compared with those from polyA-prepared carcass samples. Although hun-
dreds of DEGs in FLT versus GC carcass samples overlap between ribodepleted and polyA-prepared
samples, more DEGs were identiﬁed in FLT versus GC samples prepared with the ribodepletion method
(Figure 4B), suggesting this method may be more sensitive. There was no overlap of enriched gene
ontology terms in FLT versus GC samples processed by ribodepletion and polyA enrichment (Figures
4C and 4D).
Next, transcript integrity was evaluated in the ribodepletion-prepared FLT and GC carcass samples and
compared with polyA-selection-prepared carcass samples. Samples prepared with the polyA selection
method exhibited less coverage of the 50 portion of transcripts compared with ribodepletion-prepared
samples (Figures 4E and 4F). Thus, ribodepletion was used to further investigate the effects of preservation
method (Carcass versus Immediate) on gene-expression in a ground-based tissue preservation study.
Total RNA Sequencing Mitigates the Impact of Preservation Method on Gene Expression
Changes in the Liver
We designed a ground-based tissue preservation study to determine the best approach to mitigate the
impact of preservation method on gene expression and to identify other confounding variables important

different RR missions and compared them with standard laboratory protocols for tissue preservation. In
addition to liver samples, we also analyzed quadriceps to determine whether sample preservation methods
also confounded DGE analysis in this tissue.
Mice of the same age, sex, strain, and source as those used in the RR-1 NASA Validation mission were used
in the ground-based tissue preservation study. Mice were evenly divided into one of six groups as shown in
Figure S6. The mice in groups 1–4 were euthanized with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol) as in RR-1
(Choi et al., 2020), then subjected to various preservation protocols to evaluate the phenomena observed
in RR-1 NASA carcass and immediate liver samples. Livers and quadriceps were dissected immediately af-
ter euthanasia from mice in group 1. These tissues were divided into thirds and preserved in one of three
ways: (1) freezing in dry ice to mimic the cold stowage container that was used to freeze the immediate liver
samples in the RR-1 mission, (2) submersion in LN2, or (3) with RNAlater. After preservation, all tissues were
stored at 80C until further processing.
Although it is a common practice to dissect mice immediately after euthanasia, due to limitations in crew
time for spaceﬂight experiments, immediate dissection is not always possible. Thus, most tissues are pre-
served in situ within the carcass. We therefore sought to determine the most effective way to preserve car-
casses that would minimize unintended gene expression changes in tissues preserved in situ. Mice in
groups 2–4 were used to test three different carcass preservation methods: (1) slow freezing in dry ice
(DI) to mimic the most common method of carcass preservation used in RR missions to date, (2) snap

in RNAlater, mimicking the preservation method used in the Rodent Research-7 mission. After preserva-
tion, all carcasses were stored at 80C until further processing.
Carcasses from mice in groups 2–4 were partially thawed, and quadriceps and livers were dissected, then
snap frozen, and stored at 80C until RNA extraction to mimic the protocol most commonly implemented
when carcasses return from spaceﬂight missions, including RR-1. A summary of all liver and quadriceps tis-
sues evaluated in the present ground-based tissue preservation study are summarized in Tables S1 and S2,
respectively. Total RNA was extracted from all liver and quadriceps tissue samples and prepared for
sequencing using the ribodepletion method and sequenced.
Global gene expression and transcript integrity were evaluated in liver samples from groups 1–4 to identify
differences in DGE resulting from the carcass and immediate preservation protocols. PCA showed overlap
among immediate samples despite differences in tissue preservation methods (Figure 5A). Similar to RR-1
carcass and immediate samples (Figures 1A and S3), the dry ice-preserved carcass and immediate samples,
which mimic the RR-1 preservation conditions, clustered away from each other, albeit to a much lesser

degree than that observed with the polyA-prepared RR-1 samples (Figure 5A). Furthermore, the dry-ice-
preserved carcass samples exhibited less 50 gene body coverage than the dry-ice-preserved immediate
samples (Figure 5B). Although this observation is consistent with that observed in RR-1 carcass and imme-
diate samples (prepared using the polyA selection method) (Figures 3C and 3D), the difference was less
dramatic. Therefore, using the ribodepletion method appears to partially alleviate the differences
observed in transcript integrity between carcass and immediate samples.
Carcass Preservation by LN2 or RNAlater Immersion Most Closely Mimic Standard Tissue
Preservation Protocols
Livers dissected from carcasses preserved in either RNAlater or LN2 exhibit more overlap with immediate
preserved liver samples than those from carcasses preserved in dry ice (Figure 5A). Unlike livers dissected
from slow (dry ice) or snap (LN2) frozen carcasses, livers dissected from carcasses preserved in RNAlater
showed no difference in 50 to 30 transcript coverage when compared with livers dissected immediately after
euthanasia (Figure 5B). These data suggest that carcass segmentation and preservation in RNAlater may
protect the liver from transcript degradation when preserved in situ.

We next assessed the effects of various carcass freezing methods on gene expression changes in the
liver when compared with livers that were dissected immediately after euthanasia, then preserved in
either RNAlater or LN2. Only a few genes were differentially expressed between livers dissected imme-
diately and preserved on dry ice, in RNAlater, or in LN2 (Table S3). Similarly, pairwise gene set enrich-
ment analysis showed no signiﬁcantly enriched GO terms between these tissue preservation methods
(Table S3), suggesting that for immediately dissected livers, the tissue preservation method had minimal
impact on gene expression. Livers dissected from slow (dry ice) frozen carcasses, which most closely
mimics the carcass preservation method used in RR-1 NASA Validation and several other RR missions
(including RR-3 and Rodent Research-6), exhibited the most DEGs when compared with immediately
dissected livers preserved in either LN2 or RNAlater (Tables 2 and S4, respectively). In contrast, livers
dissected from carcasses preserved in either RNAlater or LN2 exhibited hundreds fewer DEGs when
compared with immediately dissected livers preserved in either LN2 or RNAlater (Tables 2 and S4,
respectively). These data indicate that carcass segmentation and preservation in RNAlater or preserving
carcasses by submersion in LN2 more closely mimic the common preservation methods used in terres-
trial laboratories, than does the slow freeze carcass preservation method used in the RR-1 NASA Valida-
tion study.

The Impact of Preservation Method on Gene Expression Is Tissue Dependent
To determine if the observed differences in gene expression due to carcass preservation method are
unique to the liver, gene expression and transcript integrity were also evaluated in quadriceps from
mice in groups 1–4 (Figure S6 and Table S2). PCA showed more overlap among carcass and immediate
quadriceps samples (Figure 5C) than among carcass and immediate liver samples (Figure 5A), suggesting
that gene expression in the quadriceps is less sensitive to preservation methods. Unlike liver samples,
almost no signiﬁcant differences were observed in 50 to 30 gene body coverage in quadriceps samples pre-
pared using different preservation methods (Figure 5D).
Fewer DEGs were identiﬁed in carcass versus immediate quadriceps samples than carcass versus immedi-
ate liver samples for almost every preservation method tested (Tables 3, S5, and S6), further supporting that
gene expression in the quadriceps is less sensitive to different types of preservation methods. Although
there are fewer differences over-all, similar to what was observed in liver samples, cutting the carcass
into thirds and then preserving in RNAlater resulted in the fewest DEGs when compared with immediate
dissection followed by tissue preservation in LN2 or RNAlater (Tables 3 and S6, respectively).
Gene Expression in Select Tissues Was Not Affected by the Method of Euthanasia
Because the most common euthanasia method used in RR missions to date is intraperitoneal (IP) injection
of ketamine/xylazine and the most common euthanasia method used in standard laboratories is CO2 inha-
lation, these methods were used to euthanize mice in groups 5 and 6, respectively, to determine if eutha-
nasia method is another confounding variable that could affect gene expression in select tissues (Figure S6,
Tables S1 and S2). Gene expression was evaluated in livers and quadriceps dissected from mice in groups 2,
5, and 6 (Figures S7A–S7D). PCA showed no distinct differences in global gene expression in liver (Fig-
ure S7A) or quadriceps (Figure S7B) samples dissected from mice euthanized with different methods. Pair-
wise differential gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis also identiﬁed few, if any, DEGs
and enriched GO terms among liver (Figure S7C) and quadriceps (Figure S7D) samples. These data suggest
that the types of euthanasia methods evaluated here do not impact gene expression in select tissues.
DISCUSSION
Herein, we show that protocols used to preserve mouse carcasses on-orbit have large effects on gene
expression patterns as measured by RNAseq. Indeed, changes in gene expression due to preservation

condition overwhelmed those due to spaceﬂight. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that many GO
terms enriched due to carcass preservation were involved in RNA processing. This correlated with reduced
transcript integrity (relatively poor coverage of the 50 end of transcripts) in samples from carcasses pre-
served on-orbit when these were sequenced with a polyA enrichment RNAseq protocol.
Although RNAseq following polyA selection can more efﬁciently quantify gene expression (Kumar et al.,
2017), ribodepletion methods are more effective on degraded RNA samples (Li et al., 2014; Schuierer
et al., 2017). However, although the RNA used in this study was of good quality (RIN >7), we observed a
severe bias in transcript coverage following polyA selection depending upon the tissue preservation con-
dition utilized. Speciﬁcally, samples taken from carcasses that were slow-frozen on-orbit exhibited a lower
50 to 30 coverage ratio as compared with samples taken from immediately dissected tissues. Although re-
sequencing of the carcass ﬂight samples with a ribodepletion protocol produced a more even 50 to 30
coverage ratio, our follow-on studies that directly compared slow carcass freezing with immediate dissec-
tion revealed a similar (albeit reduced) 50 to 30 coverage bias. Taken together, this suggests that slow
carcass freezing causes transcript degradation that in-turn leads to reduced 50 coverage.
mRNA degradation starts with the removal of the polyA tail, at which point degradation continues either from
the 30 end via the exosome complex or the 50 end following removal of the 50-methylguanosine cap. Deadeny-
lation of cytoplasmic mRNA is the rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation and is catalyzed by one of two com-
plexes: the CCR4-NOT complex, which consists of 10 subunits (CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT6,
CNOT6l, CNOT7, CNOT8, CNOT9, CNOT10), and the PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation complex consisting of two
subunits (PAN2, PAN3) (Siwaszek et al., 2014). We observed transcriptional changes to multiple subunits in
each of these complexes when comparing carcass and immediate samples. Most striking was the coordinated
upregulation of both Pan2 and Pan3 in the carcass samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission, which sug-
gests an increase in PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation activity, which could result in loss of polyA tails in some tran-
scripts. This could lead to poor mRNA capture by our polyA enrichment protocol and result in some of the dif-
ferences seen between the polyA enrichment and ribodepletion protocols.
Three proteins—Dcp2 (Nudt20), Nudt3, Nudt16—have decapping activity both in vitro and in cells,
whereas an additional ﬁve—Nudt2, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, Nudt19—have decapping activity in vitro.
In addition, the Dxo family of proteins acts on partially capped mRNAs (Grudzien-Nogalska and Kiledjian,
2017). Although regulation of these proteins is complex and involves subcellular localization and post-

translation modiﬁcation, we observed evidence for altered expression of these decapping enzymes: Dxo
and Nudt2 were more abundant in carcass samples, whereas Nudt15 and Dcp2 (Nudt20) were more abun-
dant in immediate samples. Although these changes are not coordinated, they do point to altered decapp-
ing activity within the carcass samples. As decapping precedes mRNA degradation via the 50 exonuclease,
XRN1, this could alternatively explain the relatively poor 50 transcript coverage seen in both polyA enriched
and ribodepleted carcass liver samples. Additional experimentation will be necessary to conﬁrm the
changes to decapping and deadenylation enzymes seen here and to understand their role in the 50 to 30
coverage bias observed.
We observed a marked difference in the 50 to 30 coverage bias between liver and quadriceps samples.
Although liver samples were sensitive to carcass preservation via slow- or snap-freeze, quadriceps samples
were not. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it could be due to the surface exposure
of the quadriceps, which would lead to more rapid quenching of biochemical processes. Second, inherent
differences in the transcript pool, mRNA half-lives, and enzymatic complement of liver and quadriceps
could offer a biological answer. Although we cannot distinguish between these mechanisms, our observa-
tions are consistent with previous results showing that postmortem changes to mRNA is tissue dependent
(Inoue et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2005; Miyatake et al., 2004).
The poor transcript integrity in slow-frozen carcasses sequenced with a polyA enrichment protocol was not
evident in pre-sequencing QC analyses. Indeed, all samples had RIN values >7, and there was no correla-
tion between the gene expression differences and RIN. This distinguishes our results from previous studies
showing a strong correlation between RIN values and loss of 50 coverage (Davila et al., 2016; Sigurgeirsson
et al., 2014). Therefore, additional pre-sequencing QC analyses capable of detecting these issues would be
useful. Low throughput sequencing is rapid, decreasing in cost, and being adopted as a QC step but does
not provide the coverage necessary to detect the biases seen here.
Alternatively, if effective pre-sequencing QC metrics cannot be developed, a number of analytical ap-
proaches could be utilized. In one category are methods that calculate additional metrics such as mRIN
(Feng et al., 2015) and TIN (Wang et al., 2016) to allow assessment of transcript integrity and exclusion
of problematic samples. In a second category are processes that account for variable transcript integrity
by considering only reads that occur near the 30 end of transcripts (Sigurgeirsson et al., 2014), controlling
for the effects of RIN using a linear model framework (Gallego Romero et al., 2014), or by calculating ideal-
ized coverage curves on a gene-by-gene basis and using these for normalization (Xiong et al., 2019). Addi-
tional analyses are necessary to determine if these approaches can mitigate the issue observed here.
Although we do not have a complete picture of the mechanisms resulting in the apparent gene expression
change resulting from slow carcass freezing, we were able to identify effective mitigation strategies (our sugges-
tions are summarized in Figure 6). Foremost among these is the utilization of a ribodepletion protocol in place of
polyA enrichment. In this study, ribodepletion resulted in more even gene body coverage and was not as sen-
sitive to slow freezing of carcasses. This is in agreement with previous studies that found that ribodepletion is less
prone to bias introduced by poor RNA quality (Li et al., 2014) and less prone to 30 coverage bias (Schuierer et al.,
2017). Beyond this, we found that two carcass preservation methods generated acceptable results, with few
DEGs and enriched GO terms when compared with the immediate dissection of tissues and preservation in
liquid nitrogen—the de facto gold standard. The ﬁrst is rapid freeze of carcasses in liquid nitrogen and subse-
quent storage at 80C, followed by partial thaw, dissection, and tissue preservation in liquid nitrogen. Although
this led to some loss of 50 transcript coverage, it had the fewest DEGs (515, adj. p < 0.05 & |Log2 FC| > 1.5) and no
enriched GO terms (FDR <0.25, NOM <0.01) when compared with immediate dissection. Alternatively, segmen-
tation of carcasses and immersion in RNAlater and subsequent storage at 80C, followed by partial thaw,
dissection, and tissue preservation in liquid nitrogen resulted in better maintenance of 50 transcript coverage
but an increased number of DEGs (1952, adj. p < 0.05 & |Log2 FC| > 1.5), although no GO terms were enriched
(FDR <0.25, NOM <0.01). As euthanasia protocols can change serum biomarkers (Pierozan et al., 2017) and
mRNA expression levels (Staib-Lasarzik et al., 2014), we were reassured to ﬁnd that the euthanasia protocols
used here did not affect gene expression in liver or quadriceps.
To conclude, our results indicate that care must be taken in choosing sample preservation protocols that
preserve transcriptional patterns and other embedded information but that are also feasible in resource-
constrained environments such as those found in space.

Limitations of the Study
This study directly assessed the effects of preservation protocols on mouse liver and quadriceps, thus
extrapolation to other tissues should be done with caution. Moreover, this study is not capable of identi-
fying the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed effects, and additional experimentation is
required to conﬁrm that the changes to decapping enzyme expression are responsible for changes in tran-
script integrity and apparent gene expression.

Diagram of the ground-based tissue preservation study to evaluate differences in indicated euthanasia 
and carcass and tissue preservation methods. Mice were euthanized with either pentobarbital/phenytoin 
(EuthasolÒ) or ketamine/xylazine injection, or CO2 inhalation. Intact carcasses were preserved by freezing 
in liquid nitrogen or on dry ice, or by segmentation (head, chest, abdomen) and immersion in an 
ammonium sulfate solution (RNAlaterÔ). Carcasses were then thawed, and livers and quadriceps 
dissected and preserved in liquid nitrogen or guanidinium thiocyanate solution (QiagenÒ RLT buffer). 
Alternatively, livers and quadriceps were dissected immediately and preserved by freezing in liquid 
nitrogen or on dry ice, or by immersion in an ammonium sulfate solution (RNAlaterÔ).

Figure S7. Comparison of gene expression and gene ontology in liver and quadriceps samples derived 
from mice euthanized with different methods. Related to Figure 5 and Tables 2&3. Liver and quadriceps 
samples dissected from partially thawed frozen carcasses of mice that were euthanized with 
pentobarbital/phenytoin (EuthasolÒ), ketamine/xylazine, or carbon dioxide inhalation were evaluated for 
global gene expression differences via principal component analysis (A, liver and B, quadriceps), and the 
number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) and enriched gene ontology (GO) terms identified by 
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis via pairwise comparisons (phenotype permutation) (C, liver and D, 
quadriceps). Liver samples dissected from partially thawed frozen carcasses of mice that were euthanized 
with pentobarbital/phenytoin (EuthasolÒ), then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ºC or 
homogenized in RLT buffer then stored for 70 d at -80 ºC were evaluated for E) global gene expression 
differences via principal component analysis, and F) the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) 
and enriched gene ontology (GO) terms identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (phenotype 
permutation) via pairwise comparisons with immediate samples preserved in liquid nitrogen or RNAlater. 
For GO terms, the number on the left corresponds to the group to the left of the ‘vs.’, and number on 
the right corresponds to the group to the right of the ‘vs.’ in the “Comparison” column. n numbers, p 
values, log2 fold changes, and FDR values are indicated. Euth=euthanasia by pentobarbital/phenytoin

Transparent Methods 
Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) Study 
Animals 
As described previously (Choi et al., 2020), the study followed recommendations in the Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011) and was approved on May 21, 
2014 by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center and 
Kennedy Space Center (Protocol number NAS-13-002-Y1). 
Spaceflight Mission 
Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) was the first mission in which animals were maintained on the ISS for a long 
duration mission in the Rodent Habitat modified from heritage Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) 
hardware.  Complete details were published previously (Choi et al., 2020). In short, RR-1 consisted of 
two experiments: ISS National Lab study (RR-1 CASIS) and NASA Validation study (RR-1 NASA).  In the 
ISS National Lab Study, ten 32-week-old female C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences, Rensselaer, 
NY) were flown to space for 20-21 days then euthanized via IP injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin 
(EuthasolÒ) and dissected onboard the ISS.  Livers were dissected then inserted into cryovials, which 
were then frozen in a cold stowage container that was pre-chilled to -130 °C before transferring to the 
Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) at the end of each dissection session (-80 °C). In the 
NASA Validation study, ten 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar harbor, ME) 
were flown to the ISS for 37 days before euthanasia and subsequent dissection.  Due to crew time 
constraint, only two (out of ten) mice were dissected immediately after euthanasia via IP injection of 
pentobarbital/phenytoin (EuthasolÒ) to recover spleen and liver tissues on the ISS.  Isolated livers were 
preserved by using the same method as the ISS National Lab study livers.  The remaining eight animals 
were euthanized, then intact carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, put in Ziploc bags, placed in a 
pre-chilled cold stowage container and stored in the MELFI.  For both the ISS National Lab study and 
the NASA Validation study, there were respective cohorts of age-matched basal animals which were 
euthanized one day after launch as a baseline control as well as age-matched ground control animals 
kept in an ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 4-day delay to mimic 
spaceflight conditions.  In addition, the NASA Validation study also had a cohort of age-matched 
vivarium control animals that were housed in the vivarium cages and followed the same experimental 
timeline and process as the spaceflight animals. A timeline indicating major events in the RR-1 mission is 
shown in Figure S1.    
Sample Collection 
The frozen intact carcasses from the NASA Validation study were partially thawed then dissected at 
NASA Ames Research Center upon return to Earth.  One lobe of liver from each carcass was removed, 
immediately homogenized in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by snap freezing the tissue 
homogenates in LN2. Quadriceps were snap frozen upon collection. Tissues were stored at -80 °C until 
extraction. 
RNA Isolation 
RNA was isolated from all liver and quadriceps samples using the following methods.  For the liver 
samples, RNA was extracted with the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the 

 
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, homogenization buffer was made by adding 1:100 volume ratio of beta-
mercaptoethanol to RLT buffer and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was cut using a 
sterile scalpel and immediately placed in 800 µL of the RLT buffer solution.  Each sample was then 
homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld 
homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates 
were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris.  The 
supernatant from each sample was used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer's protocol 
including on-column DNase treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).  RNA was eluted 
twice per sample in 30 µL RNase- and DNase-free H2O per elution.  For quadriceps samples, RNA was 
extracted using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol, and the isolated RNA samples were then treated on column with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, 
Valencia, CA) and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Concentration and absorbance ratios of all the 
isolated liver and quadriceps RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 
2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent 
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).   
Library Preparation and RNA-Sequencing 
Samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 6 or above were sent to the University of California (UC), 
Davis Genome Center where the libraries were constructed, and RNA-sequencing was performed. All 
the RR-1 RNA-sequencing data analyzed in this manuscript were obtained from the NASA GeneLab Data 
Repository (https://genelab.nasa.gov/), including GLDS-47, GLDS-48, and GLDS-168. The RR-1 liver RNA 
samples were sequenced twice. First, libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA 
library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) after polyA selection, and sequencing was done with 50 bp 
single end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform (GLDS-47 and GLDS-48).  Second, selected RNA 
samples were spiked in with ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) 
before shipping to the UC Davis Genome Center. Ribosomal RNA was removed with the Illumina 
RiboZero Gold ribodepletion kit then RNA sequencing libraries were constructed using the KAPA RNA 
HyperPrep kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and the sequencing was done with 150 bp paired end reads on 
the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (GLDS-168). 
 
Ground-based Tissue Preservation Study 
Animals 
20- to 21-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar harbor, ME) were shipped to the 
NASA Ames Research Center Animal Care Facility and were randomly housed in the standard vivarium 
cages with up to five mice per cage.  The animals were acclimated for five days before the start of 
procedures to ensure recovery from the transportation stress.  During acclimation, the animals were 
maintained on a 12h light/dark cycle and were provided with standard chow and water access ad 
libitum.  One day before euthanasia, animal body weights were measured and used to distribute the 
animals into six groups (n=6/group) with similar average body weights. Animal health status, water and 
food intake were monitored daily. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and 
Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011) and was approved on February 8, 2018 by 
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center (Protocol 
number NAS-17-006-Y1). 

 
Animal Euthanasia and Dissection 
The detailed descriptions and rationale of each group are as follows as well as outlined in Figure S6 and 
Tables S1 and S2. Group 1 (M1-M6) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of 
pentobarbital/phenytoin (EuthasolÒ) (80 mg in 0.2 ml) (Virbac, West Lake, TX) followed by cervical 
dislocation.  Dissection was performed immediately after euthanasia without freezing the carcasses.  Left 
lobes of livers and quadriceps were subdivided into three sections and each tissue section was 
preserved either by freezing on dry ice, snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, or preserved in RNAlaterÔ 
solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, WA). For the tissue sections preserved in RNAlaterÔ, tissue 
sections were submerged in RNAlaterÔ at 4 °C for 3 days then frozen and stored at -80 °C. Note that 
this is the only group of animals that were dissected upon euthanasia. Carcasses from animals in 
subsequent groups were preserved intact using various methods then dissected at a later date. Group 1 
tissue sections that were preserved by freezing on dry ice most closely mimics the process that was used 
to generate RR-1 NASA and CASIS immediate samples. 
Group 2 (M7-M12) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin 
(EuthasolÒ) followed by cervical dislocation.  The carcasses were wrapped in foil and preserved by 
freezing on dry ice, similar to the intact carcass preservation method used for the RR-1 NASA Validation 
Study.  Once frozen, the carcasses were stored at -80 °C.  On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses 
were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to 
dissection.  Left lobes of livers were removed and divided into two: one piece was snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen then stored at -80 °C; the other piece was homogenized in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) 
and the tissue homogenate was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C for 70 days before 
RNA extraction to simulate the process used to generate the RR-1 NASA “carcass” liver samples. This 
extended storage did not result in a substantial number of DEG (Figure S7E&F).  Quadriceps were snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen after dissection then stored at -80 °C. 
Group 3 (M13-M18) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin 
(EuthasolÒ) followed by cervical dislocation.  The intact carcasses were wrapped in foil and preserved by 
snap freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by storage at -80 °C.  On the day of dissection, mouse 
carcasses were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes 
prior to dissection.  Left lobes of livers and quadriceps were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen 
then stored at -80 °C. 
Group 4 (M19-M24) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin 
(EuthasolÒ) followed by cervical dislocation.  The carcasses were sectioned into 3 sections, head, chest, 
and abdomen with tail removed and discarded and each part was submerged in RNAlaterÔ solution 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, WA) and placed at 4 °C for 3 days to allow thorough permeation 
before being stored at -80 °C. On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses were removed from the -80 °C 
freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to dissection.  Left lobes of livers and 
quadriceps were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C.  This group was used 
to simulate the procedure done in the RR-7 mission and to test if gene expression signals could be 
better preserved using an RNA-specific preservative. 
Group 5 (M25-30) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (10mg/mL / 
3mg/mL in 0.3mL PBS) followed by cervical dislocation.  The intact carcasses were wrapped in foil and 
preserved by freezing on dry ice then stored at -80 °C.  On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses were 
removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to 

 
dissection.  Left lobes of livers and quadriceps were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then 
stored at -80 °C.  The euthanasia and preservation methods used in this group mimics the process used 
to generate RR-3 carcass liver samples (Smith et al., 2017).  Ketamine/xylazine is currently the most 
common euthanasia method used in RR missions. 
Group 6 (M31-M36) animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by cervical 
dislocation.  The carcasses were wrapped in foil and preserved by freezing on dry ice then stored at -80 
°C.  On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at 
room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to dissection.  Left lobes of livers and quadriceps were 
collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C.  This group represents the euthanasia 
method commonly used in terrestrial laboratories and was used to evaluate any effects on gene 
expression due to the drug-induced euthanasia methods that have been used in RR missions. 
RNA Isolation 
RNA was isolated from partial left liver lobe and partial quadriceps muscle tissues using the AllPrep 
DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer was made by adding 1:100 
volume ratio of beta-mercaptoethanol to RLT buffer and kept on ice until use. On average, 48.85 mg of 
left liver lobe and 20.08 mg of left or right quadriceps was cut using a sterile scalpel and immediately 
placed in 600 µL of the RLT buffer solution. Complete tissue dispersion was achieved using the hand-
held Polytron PT1300D homogenizer with 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate by implementing 20 
second homogenization periods at a speed of 20,000 RPM. Homogenized samples were centrifuged for 
3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample 
was used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer's protocol.  RNA was treated with RNase-
Free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and eluted in 50 µL of RNase- and DNase-free H2O molecular grade 
water. RNA concentration was measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit 
or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).   
Library Preparation and Sequencing 
Three microliters of Mix 1 or Mix 2 of ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA) at a dilution of 1:100 was added to 1.5 µg aliquots of RNA immediately after extraction. The two 
mixes were randomly distributed within the six experimental groups. In addition, Universal Human and 
Mouse Reference RNA samples (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) were included as control 
samples in the library construction and sequencing. 
Library construction was performed using 500 ng of ERCC-spiked total RNA with an average RIN of 7.8 
for liver samples and 9.8 for quadriceps samples. Total RNA was depleted of the ribosomal fraction and 
libraries were constructed with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold kit (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA). Libraries were indexed using 1.5 µM Unique Dual Index adapters with Unique Molecular Identifiers 
(Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and 15 cycles of amplification were performed to reach 
desired library concentration. Library size was assessed with 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, 
Santa Clara, CA), targeting average size of 300 nt. 
Libraries were multiplexed then quantified using Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, 
Wilmington, MA). The library pool was sequenced on an iSeq 100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to assess 
sample quality and pool balancing before large-scale sequencing. The final library pool (with 1% PhiX 

 
spike-in for instrument control) was sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 using one S4 and one S2 Reagent Kit 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA), paired-end and 149 bp reads, targeting 60 million clusters for each 
experimental sample. 
 
GLDS-49 Ground-based Freezing Study 
Animals 
As described previously (Choi et al., 2020), the study followed recommendations in the Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011) and was approved on May 21, 
2014 by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center and 
Kennedy Space Center (Protocol number NAS-13-002-Y1). 
To compare standard laboratory protocols for tissue freezing and storage with a spaceflight timeline-
simulated liver dissection and long-term storage, liver samples from twelve-week old female C57BL/6J 
mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar harbor, ME) were either immediately snap frozen (in liquid nitrogen), 
snap frozen after a 25 min delay and stored for 3 days, or snap frozen after a 25 min delay and stored for 
1 year (Figure S2). 
Sample Collection 
The liver tissues of twelve-week-old C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar harbor, ME) were received 
from the Rodent Research project collected in a ground-based preservation and storage study (Choi et 
al., 2016). Three groups of livers were included: 1) Liver tissues dissected and frozen on dry ice 25 min 
after euthanizing with pentobarbital/phenytoin (EuthasolÒ) followed by cervical dislocation. At the time 
of RNA extraction, the liver tissues had been stored at -80 °C for around 1-year; 2) Liver tissues dissected 
3 min after euthanizing with pentobarbital/phenytoin (EuthasolÒ) followed by cervical dislocation and 
snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. At the time of RNA extraction, the liver tissues had been stored at -80 
°C for around 1-year; 3) Liver tissues dissected 3 minutes after euthanizing with pentobarbital/phenytoin 
(EuthasolÒ) followed by cervical dislocation and snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. At the time of RNA 
extraction, the liver tissues had been stored at -80 ºC for only 3 days. This group served as a positive 
control for delayed dissection and long-term storage.  
RNA Isolation 
RNA was isolated using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, homogenization buffer was made by adding 1:100 volume ratio of beta-
mercaptoethanol to RLT buffer and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was cut using a 
sterile scalpel and immediately placed in 800 µL of the RLT buffer solution. Each sample was then 
homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld 
homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates 
were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The 
supernatant from each sample was used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer's protocol 
including on-column DNase treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was eluted 
twice per sample in 30 µL RNase- and DNase-free H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios 
were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). 

 
RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit 
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).   
Library Preparation and RNA-Sequencing 
Samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 9 or above were sent to the University of California (UC), 
Davis Genome Center where the libraries were constructed, and RNA-sequencing was performed. 
Libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA) after polyA selection, and sequencing was done with 50 bp single end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 
3000 platform. 
 
RNA Sequencing Data Analysis 
Raw RNA sequence data from the RR-1 NASA Validation flight liver (GLDS-48 and GLDS-168) samples, 
RR-1 CASIS liver samples (GLDS-47), and the ground-based studies designed to simulate and assess 
spaceflight euthanasia, carcass and tissue preservation, and/or storage protocols, GLDS-49, GLDS-235, 
and GLDS-236 were analyzed using the GeneLab standard RNAseq analysis pipeline 
(https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq). First, adapters were 
removed with Cutadapt (v2.3) (Martin, 2011) using the Trim Galore! (v0.6.2) wrapper. Raw and trimmed 
read quality were evaluated with FastQC (v0.11.8), and MultiQC (v1.7) was used to generate MultiQC 
reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (v2.7.1a) and RSEM (v1.3.1) (Li 
and Dewey, 2011), respectively, with ensembl genome version mm10-GRCm38 
(Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: 
Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with 
STAR (v2.7.1a) (Dobin et al., 2013) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (v1.3.1) (Li and Dewey, 
2011).  
The following samples were used for downstream analyses (abbreviations are consistent with the 
respective sample names in the GLDS Data Repository); GLDS-47: FLT and GC; GLDS-48: FLT_C, FLT_I, 
GC_C, and GC_I; GLDS-49: LN2_3d, LN2_1y, DI_1y; GLDS-168: RR1_FLT_wERCC and RR1_GC_wERCC; 
for GLDS-235 and GLDS-236, all samples indicated in Figure S6 and Tables S1 and S2 were included. 
For each GLDS dataset, quantification data from select samples were imported to R (v3.6.0) with 
tximport (v1.14.0) (Soneson et al., 2016) and normalized with DESeq2 (v1.26.0) (Love et al., 2014). All 
ERCC genes were removed prior to normalization. Differential expression analysis was performed in R 
(v3.6.0) using DESeq2 (v1.26.0) (Love et al., 2014); all groups were compared using the Wald test and 
the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned 
using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), 
PANTHER.db (Muller, 2017), and org.Mm.eg.db (Carlson, 2017). 
 
Transcript Integrity Analysis 
The geneBody_coverage.py function from RSeQC (v3.0.1) (Wang et al., 2012) was used to assess 
coverage across the median 1000 expressed genes across all datasets. A transcript integrity metric was 
defined as the ratio between the coverage in a window corresponding to position 10-30% and 80-100% 

 
(relative to the entire gene length) and used in boxplots. To determine significance between groups the 
nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test was used as distributions were not normal. 
 
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
Pairwise gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on the normalized counts from select 
samples in GLDS-48, GLDS-168, GLDS-235, and GLDS-236 using the C5: Gene Ontology (GO) gene set 
(MSigDB v7.1) as described (Subramanian et al., 2005). All comparisons were performed using the 
phenotype permutation, except those involving GLDS-48 immediate samples, which used the gene set 
permutation due to low sample size. The ranked lists of genes were defined by the signal-to-noise 
metric, and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the gene set. FDR £ 
0.25 and FDR £ 0.05 were considered significant for comparisons using the phenotype and gene set 
permutations, respectively, according to the authors’ recommendation.
