Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems
detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates.
The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head
tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected
to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize
the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadﬁsh,
Opsanus tau, in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g
(resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g
(resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation
to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway.
Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228◦/s constant angular velocity component, and
thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal
control in each ﬁsh. Afferents studied after 228◦/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without
centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their
control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity
as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–
4 days followed by a signiﬁcant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed
after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after
16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola
macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission
electron microscopy in control ﬁsh and ﬁsh exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite
the highly signiﬁcant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantiﬁed
in the same ﬁsh were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear
role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG
was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of
utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles
in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.

Utricle Response After Altered Gravity
INTRODUCTION
Gravity is a natural force that drives all living organisms
to
acquire
precise
physiological
mechanisms
to
survive.
Throughout the course of a species’ evolution the intensity
and direction of gravity have remained constant, whereas
other
environmental
factors,
such
as
predation,
climate,
vegetation, for example, with rare exceptions have not. The
highly evolved inner ear neural systems in vertebrates are
keyed
to
operating
under
gravity’s
continuous
inﬂuence
(Stensiö, 1927; Friedman and Giles, 2017). Detections of
inertial acceleration, such as linear translation during self-
motion or an external perturbation, and head orientation
with respect to gravity, such as tilts, start from the bilateral
otolith organs. The ﬁrst vertebrate ear was principally a
graviceptive statocyst more commonly found in today’s aquatic
invertebrates (Budelmann, 1988). Otolith structures contain
an inertial mass of calcium carbonate that is subject to the
pull of gravity and thus possesses weight. In an earlier study
(Boyle et al., 2001) ﬁsh were exposed to near weightlessness
in spaceﬂight and in this study we exposed the ﬁsh to
centrifugation to enhance the gravity load and queried in a
similar fashion the sensory processing characteristics of otolith
aﬀerents.
Pervasiveness
of
gravity
provides
the
nervous
system
a
common
reference
about
which
to
optimize
sensory
transduction mechanisms and perception. Otolith aﬀerents
carry the transduced signal of the gravito-inertial forces in
the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the
brainstem and cerebellum (see Goldberg et al., 2012). There
the otolith code combines with angular acceleration signals
obtained from the semicircular canals and with information
derived from the visual and somesthetic modalities to compute
a central representation of the body and its parts as well as
their dynamics in space. The end result is the resolution of
ambiguity of gravity and self-motion to allow healthy individuals
to maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions.
Despite invariability of gravity on Earth, physiological systems
are not and are adversely aﬀected by trauma, disease, and aging,
and thus central creation of the gravito-inertial vector can be
disrupted leading to vertigo, disorientation, and other clinical
disorders.
Arrival of aviation and space age oﬀered a means to
directly study the role of gravity in healthy subjects. The
established reference of self-orientation is now completely
violated by the speed at which the individual and visual world
on the retina move and by rapidly changing orientation of
the gravity vector with respect to the pilot, or removal of
gravity vector altogether in space missions. During the ﬁrst
days of spaceﬂight, most astronauts experience symptoms of
space motion sickness and disorientation (Reschke et al., 1994;
Demontis et al., 2017) linked to the otolith organs (Watt
et al., 1986; Paloski et al., 1993; Heer and Paloski, 2006).
An extraordinary hypersensitivity to applied acceleration was
observed in toadﬁsh utricle aﬀerents after relatively short
mission aboard Shuttle orbiters (Boyle et al., 2001). The
hypersensitivity presumably was the result of exposure to
near weightlessness, persisted over the ﬁrst day after landing,
returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1 g, and
closely matched the reported readaptation in astronauts after
landing following a comparable stay in space (Reschke et al.,
1994).
Physiological adjustments to a novel gravity, as witnessed
in spaceﬂight, reveal that the organism possesses adaptive
mechanisms triggered by transitions in gravity. What initiates
these mechanisms and are they compensatory to the gravity
load? In addition to the sensory aﬀerent pathways the brain
in turn sends eﬀerent signals back to the same inner ear
structures. Activation of olivo-cochlear eﬀerent neurons can
attenuate aﬀerent sensitivity and reduce its frequency selectivity
or tuning to sound (Warr and Guinan, 1979; Liberman, 1980;
Groﬀand Liberman, 2003). In functional terms, this eﬀerent-
to-aﬀerent feedback loop adjusts sensitivity of hearing in a
frequency dependent way (Brown et al., 1983; Russell and
Murugasu, 1997). Analogous to the cochlea, eﬀerent synaptic
terminals contact both vestibular hair cells and aﬀerents
(Smith and Rasmussen, 1968; Sans and Highstein, 1984;
Holstein et al., 2004; Lysakowski and Goldberg, 2008), and
activation of eﬀerent synapses inﬂuences aﬀerent sensitivity
in ﬁsh (Flock and Russell, 1976; Hartmann and Klinke,
1980; Boyle and Highstein, 1990b; Boyle et al., 2009), frog
(Gribenski and Caston, 1976; Valli et al., 1986; Chagnaud
et al., 2015), turtle (Brichta and Goldberg, 2000; Holt et al.,
2006), bird (Dickman and Correia, 1992), chinchilla (Marlinski
et al., 2004), and primates (Goldberg and Fernández, 1980;
Sadeghi et al., 2009). Reﬂex or self-generated movements often
have large purposeful acceleration components, such as those
occurring during predation (attack) and avoidance (escape)
behaviors that would impair the computation of a movement,
and importantly any novel perturbations encountered during
execution of those behaviors. To enable the aﬀerent to
continuously encode motion proﬁles during such overt behaviors
its sensitivity to acceleration is reduced, often dramatically,
but it is not clear whether the prevailing gravity load is
registered by the eﬀerent system and participates in adaptive
processes.
Another possible participant in adaptive processes in the
peripheral labyrinth is a rapid addition or removal of synaptic
bodies associated with the hair cell-aﬀerent synapse. Ross
(2000) found the number of synaptic ribbons in rat type II
otolith hair cells increased two to threefold following 14-day
exposure to weightlessness. Since toadﬁsh possess only type II
hair cells, an attractive interpretation of our earlier aﬀerent
data (Boyle et al., 2001) was an increase in synaptic strength
as an initial adaptive response to restore the “lost” gravity
detection, followed by a deletion of the added synaptic bodies
(Waites et al., 2005; Matthews and Fuchs, 2010; Graydon et al.,
2017) leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a
return to 1 g. Here, we manipulate the aﬀerent responses
to acceleration by applying variable exposures to hypergravity
(HG) via centrifugation and directly correlate the observed
aﬀerent sensitivity with serial reconstruction of hair cell-aﬀerent
complexes in two areas of the utricular macula in the same
animal.

Utricle Response After Altered Gravity
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General Procedures
Oyster toadﬁsh, Opsanus tau, of either sex, weighing ∼400 g,
were provided by the Resources Facilities of Marine Biological
Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA, United States). Fish were housed
in 300 l saltwater aquaria systems (AquaLogic, San Diego, CA,
United States) and monitored daily by the veterinarian staﬀ. All
procedures followed the principles set forth by NIH “Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Ed 8” and approved by
NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Useful data were acquired from 106 ﬁsh.
Immediately after removal from the centrifuge aquarium
(<1 min) the ﬁsh was immersed in the anesthetic agent MS222
(25 mg/l, 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, United States) diluted in saltwater (Instant Ocean
R⃝). Fish
was then placed in a Lexan polycarbonate tank ﬁlled with
chilled (15◦C) saltwater, and its head was stabilized in an Earth
horizontal plane using a mouth brace and immobilized with
stainless steel pins to the cranium; saltwater covered all but its
most dorsal surface, and its eyes and dorsal ﬁns were covered with
moist tissues. Saltwater was aerated using an air stone. MS222 was
added as needed during the course of the experiment.
A small craniotomy was made to visualize the anterior and
horizontal canal (HC) ampullae and the utricle and their speciﬁc
nerve supply. Fluorocarbon (FC75, 3M Corp, Minneapolis, MN,
United States) was injected into the cranial opening to ﬁll the
perilymphatic vestibule. The dorsal surfaces of the brainstem and
posterior cerebellum were exposed by removing ∼3 mm2 portion
of occiput above the foramen magnum. Eﬀerent vestibular
nuclei are seen as paramedial gray areas among the transversely
running internal arcuate ﬁbers under the ﬂoor of the IVth
ventricle (Highstein and Baker, 1986). A pair of sharpened
Ag/AgCl wires insulated to within 0.2 mm of their tips and
spaced ∼2 mm was lowered into the eﬀerent nuclei on either
side of the midline along a ∼45◦angle beneath the posterior
cerebellum to a depth of 1–2 mm. EVS activation behaviorally
provoked or electrically induced elicits an early arousal reaction,
characterized by an initial ﬂaring of lateral ﬁns and raising of
dorsal ﬁn, followed by straightening of the tail and extension
of the ventral ﬁns (Highstein and Baker, 1985; Boyle and
Highstein, 1990b). Fin ﬂaring was used as a guide for proper
placement of electrode array that required the lowest shock
intensity. Alert ﬁsh activate their EVS at a maximum rate of
∼100 impulses/s (ips) (Highstein and Baker, 1985), and eﬀerent
nerves faithfully follow a 100 Hz stimulus train applied to the
nuclei (Boyle and Highstein, 1990b). EVS stimulation consisted
of single pulses of 100 µs duration with trains of 100/s were
delivered in a bipolar fashion via a pulse generator coupled to
a stimulus isolation unit and captured as time-stamped events in
Spike2 (CED, United Kingdom). Conventional 30–50 M glass
microelectrodes, ﬁlled with 2 M LiCl2, were used for extracellular
or pseudo-intra-axonal recordings under direct visual control.
The recording session began less than 1 h after cessation of
centrifugation and typically lasted 12–14 h.
In preliminary experiments, we noticed utricular aﬀerents
were inconsistently responsive to EVS stimulation, while at the
same time HC aﬀerents were consistently activated. Therefore,
responses of ∼5–10 HC aﬀerents were recorded at the start
of each session to adjust and conﬁrm eﬀerent stimulation
parameters. Sinusoids of 10–20◦/s at 0.5–5 Hz were delivered
about the z-axis (yaw rotation) as well as visual localization to
identify canal aﬀerents. Consistency of stimulus intensity was
veriﬁed throughout the experiment. Another set of canal aﬀerents
(range 8–27) was recorded at the end of each session to conﬁrm
EVS eﬃcacy and evaluate canal response to rotation.
Centrifugation Procedures
NASA Ames prototype centrifuge was used to subject the ﬁsh
to HG of variable duration and magnitude (Figure 1A). The
centrifuge consists of four radial arms with a one-degree of
freedom swing gondola (labeled A1) at the end of each arm
to maintain gravity vector relative to the ﬁsh during rest and
centrifugation and positioned 1.22 m eccentric to center of
rotation. Two magnitudes of HG were applied. Main protocol
was a 38-rpm spin delivering a 1 g (Earth) plus 2 G (centripetal)
force imparting a 2.24 g (=sqrt(12 + 22)) resultant force. Duration
of 2.24 g exposures was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 16, 24, or 32 days in
groups of four to ﬁve ﬁsh. In separate experiments, the spin
was reduced to 19 rpm resulting in a 1 g centripetal force
or 1.12 g (=sqrt(12 + 12)) resultant force; duration of 1.12 g
exposures in groups of four ﬁsh was conﬁned to 4 and 16 days.
Loading and unloading of ﬁsh were scheduled to minimize
the stop time, typically <10 min. Twelve separate runs were
conducted over a 3-year period to acquire the reported HG
results.
Fully sealed ﬁsh tanks were fabricated from 1.3-cm Plexiglas
R⃝
tubes of 30.5-cm dia capped at both ends, and with a molded,
sealable opening on the curved surface to permit access to
the ﬁsh. An individual habitat (labeled A2) was placed in
each gondola, contained ∼20 l of saltwater and housed either
one ﬁsh or none at a time (for scheduling). A closed loop
system continuously circulated water through mechanical and
biological ﬁltrations and a heat exchanger to chill the saltwater
to 15◦C on the return side. The room was cooled to <15◦C to
counter heat generated by the motor. A DC powered air stone
aerated the saltwater, and pressure was released via a one-way
valve. Light/dark (12:12 h) cycles during centrifugation were
normalized to home aquaria. Fish were unrestrained and allowed
to swim freely in the habitat. During centrifugation, two forces
are applied to the ﬁsh in addition to the constant force of
gravity: a centripetal force dependent on radius of eccentricity
and rate of rotation. To account for possible variations in
vestibular function due to rate of rotation, a separate rate
table was conﬁgured that permitted a single tank to be placed
precisely at the center of rotation axis. These On-Center Control
(OCC) experiments were conducted one ﬁsh at a time with
a spin of 38 rpm for groups of four ﬁsh at either 4- or 16-
day duration. All parameters were matched to the centrifuged
ﬁsh with the exception that no (or negligible) centripetal force
was imparted to the ﬁsh. Fish were monitored in the light
cycle using video. No oﬀ-nominal events occurred during any
test.

Utricle Response After Altered Gravity
FIGURE 1 | Experimental and testing devices. (A) Ground-based centrifuge was used to apply centripetal force by constant velocity rotation within a concomitant
1 g environment. Centrifuge had four gondolas (labeled A1) positioned at a radial distance of 1.22 m from center of axis of rotation. Each gondola was gimbaled with
one-degree of freedom to deliver a constant gravity vector onto ﬁsh at any given rotational rate. Self-contained aquarium systems (labeled A2) were developed to
permit life support for one ﬁsh in each gondola consisting of mechanical and biological ﬁltrations, cooling, and oxygenation within a 12:12 light:dark cycle. Fish were
unrestrained during centrifugation and their behavior was captured in light using video. (B) Acceleration testing device was designed and fabricated to study afferent
responses to controlled translational motions delivered along the tandem rails labeled B6 and B7 at any head orientation via yaw rotation controlled by motor labeled
B3. The motor labeled B4 delivered tilt stimulation from pitch to roll. See text for more details.
Acceleration Testing Device
After surgical preparation the tank (labeled B1) was mounted
to a multi-axis linear and angular acceleration and tilt system
(Figure 1B). Head position of the ﬁsh was adjusted to
align the otoliths coplanar to Earth horizon using digital
commands to one or more axes. The cranial opening was
positioned beneath a castle-like structure on which a three-
axes remotely controlled motorized micromanipulator (MP-285;
Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, United States) and preampliﬁer
were ﬁxed.
The ﬁsh tank and castle-like platform were attached to a
Plexiglas
R⃝plate (labeled B2) supported by a 15.24-cm dia thrust
bearing and attached to a stepper motor (labeled B3) geared
(55:1) at 90◦(graphically illustrated) to provide a full rotation
about the vertical z-axis (yaw); one stepper count equals 0.00026◦.
This axis allows smooth positioning from one head angle to
another with respect to the translational axis to examine aﬀerent
directional selectivity, together with applied yaw rotational
stimuli. Its center of rotation passed through the center of the
head and bilateral labyrinths. Yaw stage was mounted to a 2.54-
cm dia shaft through roller bearing pillow blocks to a stepper
motor (labeled B4) straight geared (55:1); one stepper count
equals 0.00026◦. This axis allowed tilt about the axis coplanar
to the Earth horizontal (graphically illustrated), and provided
either static positioning or dynamic stimuli at angles between
pure roll and pure pitch depending on the head angle command
to the yaw motor. Next, the tilt stage was attached to a base plate
(labeled B5) through roll bearing pillow blocks and stepper motor
mount. The base plate was attached to a thrust block brushless
linear motor (not visible in Figure 1B), which was in turn
mounted to a 165-cm precision linear bearing guidance system
(IDC, Petaluma, CA, United States) (labeled B6); a non-contact,
incremental linear encoder provided a position sensing with
10 µm accuracy and voltage proportional to instantaneous linear
velocity was derived from the servo controller; this signal was
integrated in Spike2 data acquisition software to obtain a derived
acceleration signal. A second, slaved rail, and linear bearing
gliders (labeled B7) were coupled to the thrust block to provide
additional stability and lower the center of mass of the top plate.
The device was secured to an optical breadboard (TMC) (labeled
B8) to ensure ﬂatness and provide isolation, and ﬂoated from the
lab ﬂoor by jelly pads to absorb substrate-borne vibrations. Unit
recording stability was conﬁrmed up to 0.5 g at 12 Hz (maximum
tested). A digital controller (Galil Motion Control, Rocklin, CA,
United States) installed on a Windows-based platform provided
command signals to each motor. Software control was based on
Galil motion control libraries called from a user interface written
in Igor (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, United States) scripts
to permit step or continuous, dynamic motion about one or more
axes at selectable parameters.
Terminology of Motion Stimuli
Lab-deﬁned frame of motion reference along the horizontal axis
at 0◦corresponded to a positive acceleration directed forward out
the ﬁsh’s snout; activation of the tilt stage (Figure 1B, B4) at this
position delivered a pure roll to one side or the other. Activation
of the yaw stage (Figure 1B, B3) produced counter-clockwise
(CCW) or CW rotation in the horizontal plane to change the
head orientation with respect to the linear motion. Yaw rotation
of the platform to + 90◦(right-hand rule, CCW) about the
z-axis produced a positive inter-aural acceleration directed out
the right (ipsilateral to recording side) ear and the converse out

Utricle Response After Altered Gravity
the opposite ear, and activation of the tilt stage produced a pure
pitch with either head-down or -up. Yaw rotation of the platform
to 180◦about the z-axis produced a positive sled acceleration
directed forward but now out the ﬁsh’s tail, and activation of the
tilt stage produced again a pure roll to one side or the other. Yaw
rotation of platform to 270◦about the z-axis produced a positive
acceleration directed out the left (contralateral to recording side)
ear and the converse out the right ear, and activation of the tilt
stage produced again a pure pitch. Sinusoidal translation along
the horizontal plane ranged from 0.03 to 0.3 g at 0.3–5 Hz and
was limited by the excursion of the rail; sinusoidal tilt stimuli
ranged from 0.01 to 2◦at 0.3–10 Hz and up to 5◦static tilt and the
parameters tested were dependent mainly on recording stability;
sinusoidal yaw rotations were conﬁned to 10–30◦/s at 0.1–5 Hz.
Vestibular Test Protocol
Test protocol was designed to provide direct comparisons
of aﬀerent responses to translation within and across the
populations subjected to diﬀerent HG and adaptation conditions.
Secondarily, tilt stimuli were used to extend the response
characteristics. The hair cell’s bundle is morphologically polarized
(Wersäll, 1972) and its receptor potential is directionally sensitive
and behaves as a rectiﬁed cosine-function to bundle displacement
(Hudspeth and Corey, 1977; Shotwell et al., 1981); the functional
polarization vectors of utricular aﬀerents are distributed in
a fanlike shape (Fernández and Goldberg, 1976b), as is to
be expected from the hair cell orientations in the macula
(Spoendlin, 1964). Aﬀerent directional selectivity was deﬁned by
its maximum (Smax) and minimum or null (Smin) sensitivities.
To accomplish this a sinusoidal translation along a plane parallel
to Earth was delivered as the ﬁsh was rotated about the yaw
or z-axis (Angelaki and Dickman, 2000; Boyle et al., 2001) and
paused to collect ﬁve or more consecutive cycles. In our standard
test protocol, a 1–2 Hz translational sinusoid was delivered at
amplitude of ±0.02–0.05 g as the ﬁsh was stepped about the
z-axis in typically successive 15◦steps. Test magnitude was set
to prevent as well as possible any nonlinear distortions of aﬀerent
impulse rate (IR) such as saturation in the ON-direction or “cut
oﬀ” in the OFF-direction. In successful recordings, the aﬀerent
Smax and Smin to translation were captured within ﬁve to
nine steps; in some cases, the Smin was not obvious (discussed
later in the section “Results”). In many cases the recording
was compromised before completing the required protocol and
the data were discarded. In aﬀerents with particularly stable
recording conditions static and dynamic tilts were delivered,
selected often at the z-axis angle that elicited its Smin and
Smax responses to translations. Static tilts were typically ±1–3◦
displacement (12◦/s2 ramp on/oﬀ) and were held to determine
the time course of impulse adaptation. In some instances aﬀerent
directional selectivity was determined for both translations and
tilts.
Data Acquisition and Analysis
Data waveforms and events were digitized, displayed in real-time
using Spike2 software, and stored for later analysis (CED Power
1401). Direct voltage measures of angular displacements (in
degree) about the two (yaw and tilt) rotational axes, acceleration
(cm/s2) from the linear encoder and the derived velocity (cm/s),
and the linear accelerators (g) along the horizontal plane were
ampliﬁed externally to span the full 16-bit range of the A/D
converters, ﬁltered below the Nyquist frequency, and digitized at
500–1000 samples/s. Time stamping for stimulus trigger events,
eﬀerent shock times, and externally discriminated spike times was
acquired to a resolution of 0.08 ms.
Data were imported oﬀ-line into a custom interactive analysis
procedure written in Igor. Desired portions of record with
respect to speciﬁc stimuli were manually selected and inspected
using an interactive graphical analysis procedure. A stimulus
trigger (positive zero-crossing) was used as a time reference to
generate 100–180 bin/cycle phase histograms of stimulus and
response. A discrete Fourier analysis was applied to compute the
ﬁrst-harmonic stimulus/response amplitude and phase. Response
sensitivity (aﬀerent output/stimulus input) was calculated by
dividing IR modulation of derived 1st harmonic of modulation
by acceleration amplitude, e.g., impulse rate (IR) per second
(ips) per cm/s2 or g (9.81 m/s2) linear acceleration; response
phase is angle between output and input peaks in ◦using the
lab-deﬁned reference. A cosine function was applied to data in
a method following (Angelaki, 1991; Angelaki et al., 1993) to
determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and
response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin). Some
aﬀerents are silenced over a portion of the stimulus cycle.
In the least squares ﬁtting procedure bins lacking data were
not assigned a value of zero, and therefore the curve ﬁt was
not inﬂuenced by a truncated response. This form of response
nonlinearity may lead to a misrepresentation of data because
a portion of the curve ﬁt will take negative values. When
detected in real time, the stimulus was reduced in amplitude
to permit a more full-cycle impulse modulation. Despite these
eﬀorts and the need to maintain comparable stimulus parameters
for capturing Smax response saturation and silencing of the
discharge were often unavoidable. Both the mean IR, deﬁned
as IR at half of computed peak-to-peak modulation, and the
average IR, deﬁned as number of impulses divided by stimulus
cycle time, were measured. The former IR assists in detecting
large truncated or clipped responses and the latter took into
account the diﬀerent cycle time of sinusoids used and served as
a more reliable measure of IR during stimulation. Samples of
IR >30 s in length (from 120 to >36,000 interspike intervals)
in the absence of stimulation were taken to describe the
aﬀerent background impulse properties. Degree of regularity
was evaluated by determining the non-normalized coeﬃcient
of variation (CV) of rate, deﬁned as the standard deviation of
interspike intervals divided by mean interval. An example of
protocol for characterizing aﬀerent responses in control and
experimental ﬁsh to linear acceleration (panels A–C) and to tilt
(panel D) is given in Figure 3.
Statistical aﬀerent data analyses were performed using built-
in one-way ANOVA packages in Igor (v.7) and KleidaGraph (v.
4.5) with post hoc analysis (Tukey’s all pairs comparison test).
Data are presented throughout as the mean ± SD as single group
and compared as paired data using Student’s t-test and levels
of statistical probability are two-tailed values. Diﬀerences were
considered signiﬁcant for p < 0.05.

striola (shown with the reversal line) and medial extrastriola regions of macula were examined in same ﬁsh in which afferent recordings were collected. Sections were
viewed at 500–20,000× to verify synaptic bodies within the section and carried over into adjacent sections. Synapse characterization is based on following criteria.
Single body: most common and do not share synaptic vesicles with nearby bodies if present. Pair: less common with two synaptic bodies sharing vesicles on one
section, or adjacent sections. Group: least common with ≥3 bodies sharing vesicles on one section, or across multiple serial sections.
Histology
At the end of each experiment a small opening was made
in the dorsal aspect of the anterior canal limb, and a glass
pipette with ∼50 µm opening was inserted into canal lumen
and directed rostrally toward the anterior ampulla. The pipette
was attached to a 1 ml syringe, and the endolymph was
ﬂushed with ﬁxative solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde,
2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sucrose, and 0.2% picric acid in
0.1 M phosphate buﬀer (pH 7.4). Perfusate was colorized
using alcian blue to visualize it ﬂowing across the anterior
ampulla, entering the utricular space and duct, and exiting
via the common crus from the distal end of the cut canal
limb. The utricle and a portion of its nerve were extracted,
and the utricle was opened to expose the macula and
immersed in ﬁxative overnight. Maculae were post-ﬁxed in
2% osmium tetroxide with 1.25% potassium ferrocyanide,
dehydrated, inﬁltrated, and embedded in Epon. Blocks were
sectioned using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome in 1-
µm thick sections for surveying and 180 nm sections for
analysis.
Synaptic Body Counts
To provide uniformity of synaptic body (SB) counts within our
samples and allow direct comparison with a previous work,
a protocol based on Ross (2000) was used. The Epon block
was cut in 1 µm sections along the short axis of macula
to survey the start of the striola border. Once conﬁrmed
100 sections at 1 µm thickness were collected for a separate
morphometric evaluation. From that point 150 serial sections
of 180 nm thickness were collected to characterize the striola
region on both sides of the hair bundle reversal line; a separate
comparable collection of serial thin sections was obtained
150 µm medially to characterize the medial extrastriola zone
of the macula. Sections were collected individually, mounted
on Butvar-coated slot grids, and studied with a Leo 912
AB transmission electron microscope. More details on the
ultrastructure of the toadﬁsh utricle and the three-dimensional
reconstruction of hair cells can be found in Boyle et al.
(2018).
Each sample was coded to prevent detection of treatment
(control or HG) and experiment day. Digital mosaics were
made using the Olympus Soft Imaging System MegaView III
digital camera at 5000× (microscopic) magniﬁcation from every
seventh section and the hair cells were numbered. Mosaicked
sections served as maps for locating and identifying the
numbered hair cells in non-mosaic sections. Every hair cell
on every section (mosaic and non-mosaic) was examined for
presence of synaptic bodies and hair cell-aﬀerent synapses.
Sections were initially analyzed at 8000× magniﬁcation, and
suspected synapses were enlarged to 12,500× for validation (see
Figures 2A,B). Digital images of all likely synaptic bodies were
taken and coded with a number for the section, hair cell, and
number of synapses present. A low power image (4000×) was also
taken for better cell identiﬁcation on the map. Combined data
were used to accept or reject probable synaptic bodies. Synapses
or other structural features of interest were also photographed at
this time. Images were transferred to an SGI Onyx for permanent
storage and further synapse analysis. For counting, synapses
were recorded on sheets of paper on which there are numbered
contours of identiﬁed hair cells, with the numbers matching those
on the maps. Strict criteria for counting synaptic bodies were
followed. Only structures consisting of a central, electron-opaque
body (presynaptic density), and a halo of vesicles were counted.
Panels A and B in Figure 2 show digital images of two consecutive
sections separated by section thickness of 180 nm. Arrows in each
panel point to the same single SB in the hair cell. Figure 2C
shows a cartoon of 2 of the 10 hair cells on either side of the
reversal line in the striola as an illustration of method used in
tabulating the results. Greater than 90% of synaptic bodies are
single specializations along the hair cell internal wall, followed
by pairs of bodies, and rarely a cluster of three or more bodies.
Because of the time required to perform this task, typically 3–
4 months full-time eﬀort per macula, SB counts were done from
selected ﬁsh in which extensive physiological data were ﬁrst
obtained. Synaptic ribbons in utricular hair cells were analyzed

directional selectivity, and response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin).

RESULTS
Control Responses to Translational
Accelerations and Tilts in Normal Gravity
Response properties of utricular aﬀerent were studied in control
ﬁsh housed in 1 g to establish baseline measures needed
for direct comparison within and across ﬁsh exposed to the
diﬀerent experimental conditions. A representative utricular
aﬀerent behavior in control ﬁsh to linear acceleration (panels
A–C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure 3. Orientation of
the ﬁsh about the z-axis (Yaw Position in A) was set at 90◦to
provide a positive acceleration directed out the ﬁsh’s right ear
along the inter-aural axis ipsilateral to the recording site. Nine
consecutive cycles of sinusoidal linear acceleration (±15.7 cm/s2
or ±0.016 g) at 2 Hz were recorded (A) and averaged (B)
to give a response of the following characteristics: averaged
modulation was ±51.7 ips about a ﬁtted rate of 47 ips, with a
sensitivity of 3.3 ips/cm/s2 or 3234 ips/g occurring at peak phase
of −134◦re: acceleration. Average IR was 41 ips/cycle indicating
a slight silencing of its rate in the OFF-direction. This response
represented the aﬀerent Smax. Aﬀerent directional selectivity, a
critical parameter to measure across experimental ﬁsh to precisely
establish Smax, the spatio-temporal characteristics of averaged
data at diﬀerent head angles are plotted in Figure 3C. Cartoons
of ﬁsh show the direction of +linear acceleration at ﬁve diﬀerent
ﬁsh orientations. Smax (Figure 3C) is the uppermost point (solid
circle) on the yellow line. Rotation of ﬁsh about the z-axis from
Smax at 90◦head angle (Figures 3A,B) by half-circle to 270◦
head angle elicited a comparable and expected Smax along the
inter-aural axis but with a 180◦phase shift due to the lab-
speciﬁc denotation. Peak of response modulation with respect to
peak acceleration amplitude typically remained consistent over
a hemi-ﬁeld of head angles, rectiﬁed as the polarity shifted in
the lab-deﬁned coordinates, and showed variable leads to lags.
Data were ﬁt by a rectiﬁed (temporal or phase of response;
black curve superposed on open circle symbols of phase re:
acceleration) cosine (amplitude of modulation) function (red
curve in Figure 3C superposed on solid blue circle symbols
of gain data). Note the rise and fall of gain in a cosine
fashion as the ﬁsh’s orientation was shifted from inter-aural
accelerations to accelerations directed out the ﬁsh’s snout or tail.
The aﬀerent was tested for nearly 360◦change in orientation at
21 separate head angles. The ﬁtted nulled value of 0 for Smin
(e.g., Smin/Smax = 0 in the example in Figure 3C) reﬂected the
sharpness of directional tuning and the correspondence between
tested (ﬁlled and open circles) and ﬁtted (red and black curve)
responses was sharp. Same aﬀerent’s responses to tilt stimuli at
2 Hz, ±0.16◦displacement, were recorded in a similar fashion
at 23 separate orientations to determine Smax and Smin to tilt
(D). Smax was 801 ips/◦and nearly aligned to pure roll tilt as
expected from the inter-aural responses to linear acceleration.
Smin was near a complete null (32 ips/◦) response predicted from

the Smax to linear acceleration (yellow line) at both nose down
(Pitch-N) and tail down (Pitch-T) pitch tilts, and the Smin/Smax
ration was 0.04. Note the congruency between the responses to
the two stimuli: Smax for linear acceleration (in C) was directed
along the inter-aural axis out the right ear and Smax for tilt (in
D) occurred at pure roll with right ear down. Similarly, Smin for
linear acceleration occurred in forward or backward movements
and Smin for tilts occurred in pure nose down or up pitches.
Aﬀerent responses presented in Figure 3 are representative
of 162 aﬀerents recorded in 12 control ﬁsh, and Table 1
summarizes the principal ﬁndings (bottom row). Averaged Smax
was 2103 ± 1314 ips/g (or 2.02 ± 1.39 ips/cm/s2) and directional
selectivity was tightly tuned, having an Smin/Smax ratio of
0.085 ± 0.14 (range 0.0–0.48l, n = 81). Value in parentheses in
Table 1 is number of aﬀerents in which a clear Smin was also
captured. One-half (n = 81 out of 162) of control records had a
distinct Smin. To be included in the calculation of Smax at least
ﬁve or more tests covering 75–90◦head angles were tested and
a clear maximum on a cosine function was evident. Often Smin
was captured, but the recording was compromised before Smax
response was reached and thus omitted from analysis. Figure 4
shows the topographical structure of the utricular macula (A)
and distribution of recorded head angle at its Smax for the 162
control aﬀerents (ﬁlled black circles) in a polar plot. Head angle
at Smax occurred at virtually all angles in 2D space (±180◦)
in control ﬁsh, averaged 95 ± 82◦(Table 1) and represents an
acceleration directed out the ipsilateral (right) ear as expected
for prevalence of aﬀerents supplying the large medial extrastriola
(asterisk) macula evident in Figure 4A.
Measured values of Smax (range 149–7326 ips/g) and IR
(range 8–102 ips/cycle; mean 40 ± 19 ips; n = 162) covered
a broad range among control aﬀerents. Despite the variability
a weak, but signiﬁcant, positive correlation was found between
the Smax and IR (Figure 5A; paired correlation, R = 0.25;
n = 162). Control mean IR (MIR) at rest had an even weaker, but
nevertheless signiﬁcant, negative correlation (paired correlation,
R = −0.11; n = 107) with its degree of regularity of interspike
interval as measured by coeﬃcient of variability or CV (mean
0.53 ± 0.22; range 0.1–1.4; n = 107). As a result, Smax was
positively correlated with CV (paired correlation, R = 0.28;
n = 107), and thus broadly speaking an aﬀerent having a high
sensitivity to acceleration, a high IR during acceleration and rest,
and a more irregular spacing of its interspike intervals at rest.
Figure 6 shows two aﬀerent responses to static and dynamic
tilt. Aﬀerent in panel A is a continuation of record of the same
aﬀerent illustrated in Figure 3. At the beginning of the record
(see arrow pointing to insert) sinusoidal tilts at 2 Hz, ±0.16◦,
were delivered over seven cycles at a head angle of 345◦, within
22◦(and 15◦from pure roll) from the calculated head angle at
Smax, and the aﬀerent showed a modulation of ±112 ips, or a
unit gain of 680 ips/◦, that peaked at 43◦. After ∼25 s of rest
the ﬁsh was tilted 3◦right (ipsilateral) side down. As expected
from the response to dynamic tilts, IR was elevated by ∼125 ips
and showed a fast and slow time course of response decay of
4.3 and 44.6 s, respectively. Returning the ﬁsh back to initial
horizontal position (near the 250 s mark) and then tilting it
from the horizontal position (near the 425 s mark) to (−) 3◦left
(contralateral) side down suppressed the IR that recovered back
near rest in a similar manner. A right-down tilt back to original
horizontal position produced a comparable excitatory response.
Although responses to sinusoids and static tilts corresponded
well in most tested aﬀerents (n = 22), there was considerable
variability in response to static tilt in nearly the same number
of aﬀerents (n = 18) that were responsive to translational
accelerations. An extreme example is given in Figure 6B. In B1
sinusoids were presented at 2 Hz (±0.14◦) both before (labeled
B2) and after (labeled B3) a similar sequence of ±3◦tilts in
both directions spaced by returns to normal horizontal position.
The ﬁsh was oriented at a head angle of 135◦, and thus tilts
were delivered midway between roll and pitch, corresponding
to aﬀerent Smax for dynamic tilt. Numbers associated with each
step orientation ranged from 41 to 45 ips over the selected
period, indicating the aﬀerent was unresponsive to ±3◦static
displacements but responsive to ±0.14◦displacements when
presented as sinusoids. Because of this variability in tilt responses,
comparisons within and across the HG experimental groups were
based on aﬀerent responses to translational acceleration.
Control Responses to Efferent Vestibular
System (EVS) Stimulation in Normal
Gravity
Utricular aﬀerent response to EVS activation was in general
comparable to that observed in HC aﬀerents in the same species
(Boyle and Highstein, 1990b): elevation in IR and reduction in
response sensitivity. As mentioned in the section “Materials and
Methods,” we found that EVS activation was less prevalent in
utricle than in HC recordings. To ensure eﬃcacy of stimulation
within each experiment we ﬁrst recorded HC aﬀerents to adjust
placement and intensity of EVS pulses. Of the 112 HC aﬀerents
recorded and tested to EVS stimulation, only 13 (12%) were
unresponsive. Table 2 gives the action of EVS stimulation on IR
of control utricular aﬀerents (bottom row). Of the 32 aﬀerents
in which EVS activation could be paired to the same aﬀerent’s
IR at rest only ∼one-third (37%) were responsive whereas 63%
of the aﬀerents were unresponsive in the same preparations as
the HC recordings. The eﬀective action of EVS stimulation on
utricular aﬀerents was a near doubling of IR from 37.1 ± 23.7
to 62.8 ± 30.5 ips, without altering CV (0.6 ± 0.32 at rest and
0.58 ± 0.31 during EVS excitation).
Aﬀerent modulation to a linear acceleration can be profoundly
inﬂuenced by EVS activation. Figure 7 shows disruption of
response to a 2 Hz sinusoidal linear acceleration of ±24.4 cm/s2
(or ±0.025 g) by EVS activation via a shock train applied to
the brainstem (A) or self-generated by the ﬁsh itself (B). In
the absence of EVS activation the aﬀerent had an averaged
response modulation of ±6.3 ips (±0.26 ips/cm/s2 or ±252 ips/g)
centered about an IR of 7.2 ips that was temporarily altered by
the brief epoch of EVS stimulation. When EVS action was less
pronounced, aﬀerent rate was elevated while at the same time its
response modulation was decreased but not abolished. Record
in Figure 8A shows instantaneous IR (unit, in ips) and raw
voltage record (in mV) for 2 Hz ± 0.24◦sinusoidal tilt of the
ﬁsh rotated 90◦, thereby delivering pure roll (±right down/left

Twenty-three (23) experimental groups (rows) were tested to controlled translational acceleration in the Earth horizon plane. Nine groups are identiﬁed by the duration
of exposure, e.g., 1D indicates one (1) day (D) of exposure, to a constant resultant centripetal acceleration of 2.24 g; two groups of either 4 or 16 days of exposure to
1.12 g; ﬁve groups of 4 days of exposure to 2.24 g followed by 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 days of recovery (Rec) in normal 1 g; four groups of 16 days of exposure to 2.24 g followed
by 2, 4, 6, or 8 days of recovery in normal 1 g; two groups are identiﬁed as OCC by either 4 or 16 days of exposure to 38 revolution per minute without an appreciable
centripetal acceleration; and the last group is standard laboratory control ﬁsh. Columns provide the number of utricular afferents in each group (total of 4233 afferents);
response Smax of response at the afferent’s preferred direction (in impulse/s/g, or ips/g); Smin of response over the Smax as a measure of directional selectivity (number
in parentheses gives the number of afferents having a veriﬁed Smin); head angle (in degree, ◦) at Smax; and IR at Smax (in impulse per second per cycle time). Last
three columns are data obtained from number of HC afferents (N=), their average IR per cycle time of yaw rotation, and their averaged response sensitivity in ips/◦/s of
angular yaw rotation. Rows highlighted in red are early signiﬁcant hypersensitivity (Smax) responses and adaption rate, and row highlighted in blue are later signiﬁcant
hyposensitivity (Smax) responses and adaption rate. Values are mean ± SD. Signiﬁcance (ANOVA): ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.005, or ∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
up) stimuli. EVS stimulation elevated IR 4.5-fold from 11.8 ips (B,
control cycles) to 51.9 ips (C), while halving response modulation
from 11.6 ips (or 63.6 ips/◦; B, control cycles) to 7.4 ips (or
31.4 ips/◦; C). Mean percent reduction in response sensitivity to
linear acceleration in 27 tested utricular aﬀerents was 56.7 ± 24.1
(range 18–88%; aﬀerents in which the response was completely
abolished were not included in this calculation). During a more
steady state level of EVS activation after the initial onset of EVS
pulses, the temporal relation of response modulation to stimulus
(phase in ◦with respect to peak ◦) was unaﬀected, similar to that
seen in HC aﬀerents (Boyle and Highstein, 1990b). However, the
response to acceleration over any portion of the stimulus cycle
can be dramatically altered during short bursts of EVS activation,
such as the records in Figures 7A,B and the two brief epochs
shown in the ﬁrst portion of record in Figure 8A.
Utricular Afferent Responses to
Acceleration in On-Center-Control (OCC)
Condition
During centrifugation, the ﬁsh was exposed to both a centripetal
force dependent on its eccentricity and constant rotations per
minute (rpm) and the constant force of gravity. A separate device
was used to place the ﬁsh precisely at the center of rotation
thereby matching as well as possible all parameters except now
in the absence of centripetal force. Fish were exposed to either
4 or 16 days of rotation at 38 rpm. As listed in Table 1,
the OCC utricular aﬀerents behaved statistically identical in all
measured parameters after both 4-day (N = 226 aﬀerents) and
16-day (N = 177 aﬀerents) to the control ﬁsh not exposed to
any experimental condition prior to recordings. In the insert
in Figure 9B Smax (in ips/g) of individual responses are
plotted as a function of percent within each control group, and
shows the complete overlap of OCC aﬀerents with their control
counterparts.
Horizontal Canal Afferent Behavior in
Normal and Altered Gravity: Internal
Control
Horizontal canal aﬀerents recorded in control ﬁsh in normal
gravity (n = 58) behaved in an identical manner to that
previous reported in toadﬁsh (Boyle and Highstein, 1990a).

line in striola region is in red; more details of the utricle morphology can be found in Boyle et al. (2018). From left to right (medial to lateral): large medial extrastriola
(asterisk), a striola zone on either side of the reversal line (red line), and a relatively narrow lateral extrastriola region approaching the ampullae of the anterior (AC) and
horizontal (HC) semicircular canals. Hair bundle on each hair cell is morphological polarized and broadly depicted as blue arrows pointing from the shortest
stereocilia to the kinocilium, and the polarization ﬂips at the reversal line (red line). (B) Afferent responses (ips/g) are plotted in a polar graph as a function of head
angle (◦) at Smax for control ﬁsh and for ﬁsh exposed to 2.24 g for 4 or 16 days. Head angle at Smax of recorded responses was consistent for all ﬁsh, indicating no

recorded in these three separate conditions showed responses aligned to innervating hair cells in the medial extrastriola.

HC aﬀerents, 162 HC aﬀerents in On-Center-Control (OCC)
aﬀerents, 604 HC aﬀerents recorded after 1–32 days of
2.24 g centrifugation, 518 HC aﬀerents recorded after 4 or
16 days of centrifugation followed by a recovery period,
and 97 HC aﬀerents recorded after 4 or 16 days of 1.12 g
centrifugation.
Despite
the
wide
range
of
duration
and
intensity of the experimental conditions, HC aﬀerent IR
was unaﬀected.
Horizontal canal aﬀerent responses to yaw rotation were also
unaﬀected by the experimental conditions (q.v. Supplementary
Figure 1). HC aﬀerents exhibit a wide range of response dynamics
and can be broadly termed as low or high gain velocity encoding
and acceleration encoding aﬀerents (Boyle and Highstein, 1990a),
and the prevalence of each aﬀerent population and its response
characteristics were equivalent under all experimental conditions.
Table 1 (right columns) gives the averaged response sensitivity
(in ips/◦/s) of HC aﬀerents to a 0.5–1 Hz (±10–15◦/s) sinusoidal
angular yaw rotation for each experimental group. No signiﬁcant
diﬀerence was observed in response and IR to rotation among
the recorded aﬀerents, suggesting there was no broad, non-
descript action on the periphery during the experimental tests.
In conclusion, behavior of HC aﬀerents serves as an internal
control of variables associated with centrifugation, such as the
duration (1–32 days) of 1.12 or 2.24 g centrifugation, length
of recovery to normal gravity (1–8 days), and constant angular
rotation without centripetal force (OCC) used in the present
study.
Utricular Afferent Responses to
Acceleration and Tilt Following 2.24 g
Exposure
Principal reaction to HG was an adjustment of response sensitivity
as a function of the magnitude and duration of exposure (q.v.
Supplementary Figure 2). Reaction was bi-phasic starting with
a signiﬁcant twofold increase in Smax after 3 (N = 228 aﬀerents)
and peaked at 4 (N = 153 aﬀerents) days of exposure (highlighted
in red in Table 1), with a return to normal values after 5
(N = 148 aﬀerents) and 8 (N = 196 aﬀerents) days of exposure,
and then followed by a signiﬁcant reduction by ∼one-third after
16 (N = 245 aﬀerents), 24 (N = 177 aﬀerents), and 32 (N = 192
aﬀerents) days of exposure to 2.24 g (highlighted in blue in
Table 1). The Smin/Smax ratio remained the same on average for
all populations within and across the wide range in experimental
conditions. Interestingly, signiﬁcant changes were observed in
average IR at Smax (in ips/cycle; Table 1): average IR was reduced
at 2D prior to the sensitivity increase at 3D, and stayed at
a 20–40% lower level from 5D to 32D despite the signiﬁcant
changes in Smax over these periods of 2.24 g exposures. Records
from the 4- and 16-day ﬁsh conﬁrmed that the Smax of the
majority of aﬀerents, like their control counterparts, occurred
at head angle associated with a positive acceleration directed
out the ipsilateral labyrinth (Figure 4B, Table 1). In addition,
the positive correlation of Smax and average IR (Figures 5B,C)
was maintained after exposures to HG, even with a signiﬁcant
reduction in both Smax and average IR recorded in the 16-day

and CV and, in turn, Smax were also maintained at the same
level of conﬁdence. Data obtained in recovery periods to 1 g
from 1 to 8 days after HG indicated that average IR set point was
restored after 2 days in normal gravity. It is important to note that

delivered at a head angle of 345◦, or nearly a pure roll stimulus, with right side
(positive values) down and ipsilateral to recorded afferent. Static
displacements were delivered at the same head angle starting with right side
down and hold, a tilt in the opposite direction to normal horizontal position
and hold, a left side down and hold, and a return tilt in the opposite direction
to normal horizontal position and hold. Fast (red curve) and slow (yellow curve)
time constants of return to baseline IR were seen in the excitatory direction of
tilt. Tilt stimuli in the opposite direction, contralateral to recording site, silenced
the afferent in both instances. (B1) Different control afferent has a response to

static displacements at the afferent Smax of 135◦, midway between left side
down roll and tail down pitch, afferent maintained a near constant IR of
41–45 ips (labeled on tilt trace).

unaﬀected in terms of response modulation to yaw rotation as
mentioned above, but also had an average IR (41 ± 21 ips/cycle)
equal to that of utricular control aﬀerents (40 ± 19 ips/cycle) that
remained consistent under all experimental conditions (right two
columns of Table 1).
Utricular Afferent Responses to
Acceleration Following 1.12 g Exposures
In a separate, and smaller, sample aﬀerents were studied after 4 or
16 days of HG at one-half the resultant force as the larger sample.
A signiﬁcant elevation in Smax (3274 ± 2113; N = 184 aﬀerents;
p < 0.0001, ANOVA) was observed after 4-day exposures to 1.12 g
(highlighted in red in Table 1), about half way between control
Smax and 4D 2.24 g Smax. Although a reduction in Smax was
seen on average in 183 aﬀerents studied after 16-day exposures, it
was not statistically signiﬁcant. All other parameters of response
to acceleration and IR properties were unchanged.
Comparison of Utricular Afferent
Responses to Acceleration Following
Micrograms and 2.24 g Exposures
Utricular aﬀerents exhibited a profound hypersensitivity when
tested to translation upon return to Earth after 9–16 days of
microgram exposure on two shuttle orbiter missions and a
recovery back to normal after several days (Boyle et al., 2001).
These data are given in the percent plot in Figure 9A. Nearly
60% of the aﬀerents tested within 10–16 h after landing (solid red
circles) were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.005) more sensitive than control
aﬀerents (solid black line). To put this in perspective an aﬀerent
for example had a near saturating IR modulation of ±30 ips for a
1.6 Hz stimulus at an amplitude of ±0.0026 g, in essence a minute
vibration that otherwise would be mostly ineﬀective in eliciting a
modulation.
Figure 9B gives a percent plot of aﬀerent Smax to translation
for control ﬁsh (solid black line and insert) and for those after
exposure to varying duration of 2.24 g from 1 to 32 days in
a comparable manner to Figure 9A for comparison. Initial
hypersensitivity was most evident in aﬀerents after 3 (solid orange
circles) or 4 (solid red circles) days of 2.24 g exposures, and the
separation of Smax from control population was nearly 100%.
Responses in these exposures unmistakably resembled those seen
initially after space travel and were unexpected. Smax recovered
within normal levels at the 5- and 8-day tests before a signiﬁcant
Smax reduction was observed after 16–32 days of 2.24 g exposures
(Table 1). Mean Smax (ips/g ± SD) of the experimental data
presented in Figure 9B are plotted against days of exposure
to 2.24 g in Figure 10A. Interestingly, aﬀerent characteristics
across the three (16-, 24-, and 32-day) groups displaying a Smax
hyposensitivity was statistically similar (ANOVA), suggesting a
plateau had been reached at this stage of the adaptation process.
Re-adaptation of Afferent Response
After Return to Normal Gravity
Figure 10B provides a summary histogram (same format as
Figure 10A) of Smax in aﬀerent populations initially exposed to
4 or 16 days of 2.24 g and returned to 1 g until a restoration of
normal activity was established. Early hypersensitivity observed
after 4 days at 2.24 g took >4 days to recover to control levels,
and the later hyposensitivity observed after 16 days at 2.24 g
recovered more quickly and required >2 days in 1 g to recover
to control levels. Thus, the bi-phasic hyper- to hypo-sensitivity to
translations after centrifugation reﬂected an adaptive process that
was restorable with a delay to its original state.
Possible Mechanism(s) of Afferent
Adaptive Processes to Altered Gravity:
Efferent Action
By inference aﬀerent sensitivity is expected to lessen or IR to rise
or both when EVS is activated episodically or in a steady state;
conversely, the removal of a steady state EVS action could lead
to an aﬀerent sensitivity increase and IR could remain the same
or even decrease. Comparing the results in Table 1 it could be
inferred that the early increase and later decrease in Smax was due
to an OFF and On EVS action on the hair cell alone, respectively,
without a direct action on the aﬀerent. EVS action on aﬀerent
rate was almost exclusively excitatory (Figures 7, 8) from the
axo-dendritic synapse on the aﬀerent and not through the axo-
somatic synapse on the hair cell (Boyle et al., 2009). No consistent
evidence emerges from pairing Smax and IR to support a direct
systematic EVS role on aﬀerent processing after centrifugation.
Table 2 tabulates the magnitude and prevalence of response
of EVS activation for paired data within each test group. With
only one exception, EVS pulses signiﬁcantly elevated as expected
the IR (EVS IR) above the MIR of background IR in all groups.
The sole exception was the aﬀerent group subjected to 32 days at
2.24 g (32D 2.24 g). Here, aﬀerent response to EVS activation was
noticeably infrequent with only 11.2% responding (against 37.2%
in control aﬀerents), and noticeably weaker with a diﬀerence
of EVS to non-EVS epochs or IR (1EVS) signiﬁcantly less
(6.9 ± 14.9 ips) than that for control aﬀerents (25.7 ± 17.6 ips).
These ﬁndings at the 32-day mark are not consistent with the
signiﬁcant Smax reduction (Table 1). In the same vein, the
aﬀerent response to EVS pulses after 4 days at 2.24 g (4D 2.24 g)
was more prevalent with 62.3% responding with signiﬁcantly
greater 1EVS (43.8 ± 38.1 ips) than that for control aﬀerents.
These ﬁndings suggest that EVS action was greatly enhanced
at 4-day mark, but again the action is not consistent with the
signiﬁcant Smax increase (Table 1). At the present stage it is not
possible to establish direct causality of aﬀerent IR and response
behavior after HG exposures and EVS action.
Possible Mechanism(s) of Afferent
Adaptive Processes to Altered Gravity:
Synaptic Remodeling
Aﬀerent response sensitivity and hair cell synaptic organization
were examined in the same animal to determine the possible
causality between response magnitude and number of synaptic
bodies. Figure 11 shows percent plots of Smax (A, in ips/g) and
average IR (B, in ips/cycle) in three groups: controls (black solid
circles and line; N = 2), 4 days at 2.24 g (red solid circles and
line; N = 2), and 16 days at 2.24 g (blue open circles and line;
N = 2). Importantly, highly signiﬁcant diﬀerences in response

SD imp/s/g; two ﬁsh; n = 89) ﬁsh from controls (2045 ± 1314 SD
imp/s/g; two ﬁsh; n = 39). In Figure 11B, the average IR at Smax
(in ips/cycle) also diﬀered: rate was signiﬁcantly lower (p < 0.01,
ANOVA) in 16-day (28 ± 15 SD ips/cycle), and higher, but not
signiﬁcantly so, in 4-day (46 ± 21 SD ips/cycle) ﬁsh from control
aﬀerents (39 ± 24 SD ips/cycle). Figure 11C gives the results of
hair cell SB counts in the same ﬁsh from which aﬀerent responses
were obtained (Figures 11A,B). Number of SB per 100 µm2 was
determined for two macular regions, one straddling the reversal
line in the striola (shaded columns) and the other 150 µm away
in the medial extrastriola (solid columns), in controls (black) and
ﬁsh exposed to 2.24 g for 4 (red) or 16 (blue) days. On average
SB count per hair cell was 4–7 in the two macular regions in
each experimental group, and ranged in number from 1 to 13
(n = 223) in control medial extrastriola, 1 to 25 (n = 505) in
control striola, 1 to 20 (n = 520) in 4-day medial extrastriola,
1 to 22 (n = 484) in 4-day striola, 1 to 16 (n = 253) in 16-
day medial extrastriola, and 1 to 20 (n = 575) in 16-day striola
regions. Variability within each group was large and thus, despite
the high number of hair cells completely reconstructed in three
dimensions, single and multiple SB densities in the two macular
regions were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between control and HG
ﬁsh. This is in stark contrast to the clear separation in aﬀerent
physiology.
DISCUSSION
As a necessary ﬁrst step in determining the role of the utricle
in neural adaptation to novel gravity loads, otolith aﬀerents
were studied to establish benchmarks for comparison within
and across the experimental groups. Vestibular aﬀerents, both
semicircular canal (frog: Honrubia et al., 1989; toadﬁsh: Boyle
and Highstein, 1990a; Boyle et al., 1991; bird: Landolt and
Correia, 1980; chinchilla: Baird et al., 1988; cat: Anderson et al.,
1978; squirrel monkey: Fernández and Goldberg, 1971; rhesus
monkey: Schneider et al., 2015) and otolith ﬁbers (cat: Loe
et al., 1973; pigeon: Si et al., 1997; primates: Fernández and
Goldberg, 1976a,b,c; Angelaki and Dickman, 2000; Jamali et al.,
2009; Yu et al., 2012) diﬀer from one another in their discharge
patterns and response properties to adequate stimuli. As seen in
other species toadﬁsh utricular aﬀerents showed a wide range of
discharge rates, regularity of discharge, and response sensitivity
to sinusoidal linear acceleration with a typically tight degree of
directional selectivity.
The physical basis for diﬀerences in response dynamics
among otolith aﬀerents is not fully understood, and determining

Utricle Response After Altered Gravity
FIGURE 7 | Electrically evoked (A) or self-generated (B) efferent vestibular
system (EVS) activation elevates afferent rate and reduces or even blocks its
response to linear acceleration. In the absence of EVS activation afferent
showed an averaged response of 2 Hz linear acceleration. During a brief pulse
train of EVS stimulation (A), afferent IR was elevated and its response to
applied acceleration disrupted. This result is also seen when the ﬁsh activated
the EVS on its own as seen in the two epochs in B. Self-generated epochs of
EVS activation excite the afferent with differing patterns and alter its response
to an applied perturbation. Traces in A and B are from top to bottom
instantaneous ﬁring rate (Unit, ips), EVS pulse train, raw voltage of afferent
(mV), and the applied linear acceleration (LA, in cm/s2).
utricular macula and how these signals enter central otolith reﬂex
pathways have been a challenge. Aﬀerent dendritic organization
to the type of hair cell (type I and/or type II) it supplies varies
in complexity (see review by Goldberg et al., 2012; Boyle et al.,
2018), and it is reasonable to assume that hair cell excitation
is not uniform (Spoon et al., 2011; Curthoys et al., 2017).
In chinchilla utricle about three-fourths of recorded aﬀerents
displayed a more regular discharge of their interspike intervals
(Goldberg et al., 1990a,b), and corresponds to about three-fourths
the total area of macula designated as the medial extrastriola.
Toadﬁsh utricle is structurally similar in the broad sense to
other species, including amniotes and other anamniotes, and
its hair cell polarization is highly organized across the more
2D macula surface (Boyle et al., 2018). Like the chinchilla,
toadﬁsh medial extrastriola occupies about three-fourths the
total macula area (Figure 4A) and reﬂects the responses of
the majority of aﬀerents recorded in this study (Figure 4B).

Unlike the chinchilla, regularity of discharge of toadﬁsh utricular
aﬀerents span a continuum but three-fourths of them are more
irregularly discharging. An attractive hypothesis is that vestibular
aﬀerent inputs are matched to the dynamic requirements of
the various reﬂexes they target (Highstein et al., 1987; Boyle
et al., 1992; McArthur and Dickman, 2008), and evolutionary
pressures drive the particular behaviors (Nilsson, 2013; Straka
and Baker, 2013; Straka et al., 2014). In this scheme, the
prevalent irregular utricular aﬀerents are best matched to the

Utricular Afferent Responses After
Microgravity (µg) Exposure
From the earliest manned orbital missions we know that
changes occur in processing of gravitational information during
adaptation to microgram and re-adaptation to 1 g upon return
to Earth. The adaptive mechanisms to altered gravity might
be conﬁned to the peripheral sensory structures or involve
central processing centers or likely require the participation
of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Within
the ﬁrst day after STS-90 and -95 shuttle landings, a response
hypersensitivity to acceleration stimuli was observed in utricular
aﬀerents (Figure 9A; Boyle et al., 2001). Reduced gravity
in orbit during these relatively short microgram exposures
apparently resulted in an upregulation of aﬀerent sensitivity.
Time course of return to normal sensitivity in toadﬁsh aﬀerents
paralleled the reported decrease in vestibular disorientation in
astronauts after return from shuttle missions (Reschke et al.,
1994). Although belonging to a distinct group of animals,
recordings taken directly from gravitoreceptors of the land
snail (phylum Mollusca), and thus no intervening synapse
as in aﬀerent recordings, after exposures of 12–16 (Balaban
et al., 2011) and 30 (Aseyev et al., 2017) days in space also
showed a pronounced response hypersensitivity to tilt. In a
complimentary study in tilapia the gain of an otolith-related
vestibuloocular reﬂex was signiﬁcantly increased within the
ﬁrst postﬂight week, and returned to control levels in the
second postﬂight week, of space missions (Sebastian et al.,
2001).
Orbiting space stations provide a platform to extend human
presence in space and capture the physiological response(s) to
longer duration of exposures. Hallgren et al. (2016) measured
in 1 g the ocular counterrolling (OCR), an otolith-mediated
reﬂex, during centrifugation before and after a 6-month stay
in space in 25 astronauts and found a signiﬁcant reduction
in OCR magnitude after landing and its restoration to normal
levels in 9 days. Their results are largely in agreement with
changes in gaze control reported by Kornilova et al. (2012) in
cosmonauts to 129–215 days in space. Adaptation to microgram
is likely to change over time from an initial over compensation
to restore normalcy to a hyposensitivity more in line with the
prevailing gravity. Do the processes of adaptation to microgram
in orbit or weightlessness in deep space missions reach a

plateau or continue to evolve in time are questions yet to be
answered.
Utricular Afferent Responses After
Hypergravity Exposure
Based on the robustness of postﬂight hypersensitivity of utricular
aﬀerents, we expected to ﬁnd a compensatory hyposensitivity in
response to HG. The initial hypersensitivity was unexpected and
developed at Day 3 and peaked at Day 4. It was followed by a
period of normalcy and then the development of the anticipated
hyposensitivity after 16–32 days of HG. Initial hypersensitivity
was robust and recovered to normal levels after ∼4–6 days
at 1 g. Utricular aﬀerent response to HG did not reﬂect a
systemic action on the labyrinth as a whole, since HC aﬀerents
were consistently normal in response and discharge properties
and remained independent of level and duration of HG in
the same ﬁsh. OCCs performed at 4- or 16-day exposure to
228◦/s (38 rpm as in 2.24 g runs) constant angular velocity
were identical in all measures to their utricular and canal
aﬀerent counterparts in non-rotated controls. Video taken during
the light cycle did not reveal any aberrant behavior during
the diﬀerent exposures of 2.24 g, perhaps suggesting a central
compensatory mechanism in operation. Of prime importance is
the fact that in the same species we have the neural response
to microgram and a more comprehensive evaluation of the
neural response to HG. These results demonstrate that the
utricle undergoes continuous plasticity based on magnitude of
the prevailing gravity and suggest the possibility that the process
of re-adaptation from HG exposure might mimic the process of
adaptation to microgram.
The organism’s response to transitions in gravity is not simply
a step increase or decrease, but varies with time of exposure
to the new level of force. Majority of astronauts experience
mild-to-severe disorientation for 3–4 days upon initial exposure
to microgram, a condition akin to terrestrial motion sickness
(Reason and Brandt, 1975). Even though most humans eventually
adapt after days to microgram, return to 1 g causes vestibular
dysfunction (Reschke et al., 1994; Oman, 1998; Black et al.,
1999). The behavior (Anken and Rahmann, 1998) and otolith
aﬀerent response sensitivity (Boyle et al., 2001) of ﬁsh follow a
comparable course of readaptation after landing and therefore
restoration to normalcy is likely a general reaction of the
organism to short duration (weeks) exposure to microgram. Our
data (Figure 10) conﬁrm that readaptation also occurs in aﬀerent
response to HG.
The organism’s early response to an abrupt change in the force
of gravity is remarkable. In the Russian Cosmos/Bion missions
many of the eﬀects observed early in ﬂight on vestibular and
oculomotor function in nonhuman primates are consistent with
response hypersensitivity. Badakva and Kozlovskaya summarized
their results in Cohen et al. (2005). Within the ﬁrst days
in orbit gaze shifts to lateral visual targets were hypermetric,
despite a reduction in head displacement. This hypermetria
caused positional errors and was compensated by an increase
in gain of the angular vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (aVOR) to 1.5
on Day 2 and remained high (2.0) up to Day 8. Associated

with gaze hypermetria, response of vestibular nuclei neurons
during gaze ﬁxation task gradually increased to a maximum on
Day 4, like our present HG data, and returned back to normal
for the rest of the 1–2 week ﬂight. Gualierotti and colleagues
(Bracchi et al., 1975) directly addressed otolith aﬀerent discharge
in µG in technically challenging experiments in the bullfrog.
Although the interpretation of their data is diﬃcult, otolith
aﬀerent discharge appeared to increase within the ﬁrst 3 days of
the orbital mission and returned to normal at Day 5. Interestingly,

(4945 ± 2823 SD imp/s/g; n = 93) and signiﬁcantly lower Smax (p < 0.002) in

(2045 ± 1314 SD imp/s/g; n = 39). (B) The average IR (in ips/cycle) during
acceleration at Smax also differed between afferents in these groups: rate was
signiﬁcantly lower in the 16-day (28 ± 15 SD ips/cycle), and higher, but not
signiﬁcantly so, in 4-day (46 ± 21 SD ips/cycle) ﬁsh from the control afferents
(39 ± 24 SD ips/cycle). Level of signiﬁcance (ANOVA): p < 0.0001 (∗∗∗),
p < 0.002 (∗∗), and p > 0.01 (∗). (C) Number of synaptic bodies per hair cell
was determined using 3D computerized serial reconstruction techniques at
transmission electron microscopy level from 150 sections of 180 nm thickness
from two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line (shaded columns)
and the other 150 µm away in the medial extrastriola (solid columns), in
control ﬁsh (black) and ﬁsh exposed to 2.24 g for 4 (red) and 16 (blue) days.
Average (±SD) number of synaptic bodies is given above each column.
Number (n=) of completely reconstructed hair cells used in this analysis was
large and ranged from 223 to 575 hair cells as indicated. Variability within
each group was very large and thus, despite the high number of
reconstructed hair cells, SB densities in the two macular regions were NOT
signiﬁcantly different between control and centrifuged ﬁsh despite the highly
signiﬁcant differences in their responses to acceleration.
this closes matches our HG data after exposure to 2.24 g. The
initial reaction in astronauts and animals points to a possible
common mechanism. Although it is clearly a speculation, the
evidence suggests an exaggerated otolith reaction is evoked to a
novel gravity challenge. This challenge occurs in either direction
from a loss of gravity in spaceﬂight to an applied force by
centrifugation on the ground. To what extent is this simply
a transitory maladaptation or a behaviorally relevant response
remains to be determined. Unfortunately, critical data in real-
time targeting this initial response to microgram and HG remain
lacking.
Mechanisms of Utricular Adaption to
Gravity
We sought to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying
utricular adaptation to transitions in gravity levels, particularly
hair cell synaptic remodeling and EVS action. Observed changes
are thought to reﬂect the following possibilities: (a) change
in transducer sensitivity, (b) temporary structural alteration
aﬀecting mechanoreception, (c) pre- or post-synaptic alteration
in the strength of synaptic transmission, or (d) neural feedback
circuit or eﬀerent copy switched on or oﬀ. We examined the
latter two possibilities in detail and both attempts brought us no
closer to identifying a clear mechanism that initiate and regulate
adaptation.
(a) Transducer changes. Prolonged deviation of the sensory
hair bundle leads to an adaptation of otolith hair cell
receptor potentials (Eatock et al., 1987; Goldberg et al., 2012).
Manifestation of this adaptation can be seen in responses of
some otolith aﬀerents to prolonged steps of linear acceleration
(Fernández and Goldberg, 1976a,b). Microgravity might be
thought of as a step of hair bundle motion in the “oﬀ” direction,
and adaptation in transducer mechanism(s) might negate any
aberrant aﬀerent response in microgram. The converse might
occur in HG. The onset and time course of transducer
adaptation might be both rapid and long-lasting, and involve
a reconﬁguration of the transmembrane channel (TMC)-like
proteins of the transducer pore (Pan et al., 2018). Our data do
not oﬀer a clear insight.
(b) Structural changes of otolith mass. Otolith weight
by gravity intensities might regulate the otoconia mass and
alter its coupling to stereocilia in a manner that aﬀects
mechanotransduction,
for
example
a
change
of
otolith–
stereociliary coupling that adjusts bundle deﬂection for a given
movement (Fredrickson-Hemsing et al., 2012). Wiederhold
et al. (1997, 2000) showed that the otolith mass in growing
snails was increased by microgram exposure. A slowing in
otolith growth during development was reported to occur
under HG conditions in neonate ﬁsh (Anken et al., 2000a),
and also after vestibular nerve transection again in neonates
(Anken et al., 2000b). However, Lim et al. (1974) and Sondag
et al. (1995) in well-controlled studies could not demonstrate
any change in the otoconia Ca+2 content, shape, size, or
distribution in adult hamsters subjected to HG. More recently,
Aceto et al. (2015) found a decrease in otolith calciﬁcation after
prolonged HG exposure in zebraﬁsh, presumably the result of
a regulation of carbonic anhydrase and other matrix protein
productions (Anken et al., 2004; Anken, 2006). As bone is
adversely remodeled during space missions (Demontis et al.,
2017), calcium carbonate on the other hand might be deposited
on existing otoconia to provide greater “weight” in an eﬀort to
restore the “gain” of gravity sensation; conversely, HG would
lead to an ablation of otoconia mass to “rebalance” function. Our
aﬀerent recordings did not reveal any aberration(s) in discharge

Utricle Response After Altered Gravity
properties or spurious excitations except a change in response
sensitivity, implying that if such a mechanism was in operation,
the remodeling of the otolith mass was uniformly distributed.
Although this mechanism is attractive, particularly for long-term
habituation in a reduced gravity, we have no data collected in this
study that directly addresses this mechanism.
(c) Synaptic plasticity. A widely considered candidate
responsible in the adaptive response to microgram is plasticity
of hair cell ribbon synapses (Moser et al., 2006). The ﬁndings
of Ross (2000) promoted this hypothesis: number of ribbon
synapses in certain type II hair cells in rat was labile, increasing
by approximately 55% following exposure to microgram; type I
hair cells were less aﬀected. Toadﬁsh vestibular epithelia possess
only type II hair cells and lack the specialized nerve calyx seen
in reptiles, birds, and mammals. Also in toadﬁsh the number of
en passant and terminal boutons of a given semicircular canal
aﬀerent, indicating a potential locus for synaptic coupling to a
hair cell, are positively correlated with its response sensitivity
(Boyle et al., 1991). Thus, an increase in ribbon synapses in
rat utricular hair cells by microgram exposure aligns with
our observed post-ﬂight hypersensitivity in toadﬁsh utricular
aﬀerents. However, more recent evidence by Sultemeier et al.
(2017) in mouse exposed to 15 days of microgram paints a
diﬀerent picture. They found synapse densities decreased, not
increased as seen by Ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells and
remained unchanged elsewhere in other macula regions and
HC cristae. Although one species is likely more susceptible
to gravity inﬂuences than another based on body mass, this
discrepancy between rat and mouse is intriguing but not readily
apparent, and must be resolved in future studies. As we discuss
below, the picture is even more blurred when we make a direct
comparison between recorded response sensitivity and 3D serial
reconstruction of synaptic bodies in individual hair cells in the
same animal.
An important piece of relevant evidence is the time of
synapse formation and reformation in inner ear structures.
Turnover rate of ribbon synapses in vestibular hair cells is
unknown, but some estimates derived from other systems
are useful. Ribbon synapses in the visual system of albino
rat are said to have a life span of ∼8 h (Spadero et al.,
1978) and are structurally plastic particularly in assembly and
disassembly processes (Schmidt and Drenckhahn, 1993) during
development (Regus-Leidig et al., 2009). In the hippocampus,
asymmetric synapses form and disappear within a few minutes
(Desmond and Levy, 1986). Although related to diﬀerent systems,
these data indicate that speciﬁc times of synapse formation
are from minutes to hours (Cragg, 1969; Cotman and Nieto-
Sampedro, 1982). Further, Puro et al. (1977) showed that synapses
not only turn over but that the rate of turnover increases
during development, suggesting that both synapse formation
and termination rates are regulated and that the speciﬁcity of
synaptic connections can be increased by selective termination
of synapses. Thus, as sensitivity is decreased to compensate for
hyperstimulation, excess synapses will be deactivated by receptor
downregulation and “anchors” inside the cell mark the former
receptor sites (Ziﬀand Barry, 2002). Since the sudden change
of gravity is an extreme condition, the speciﬁc time of synapse
rearrangement might be expected to be longer: from hours to
several days.
Despite the attractiveness of synaptic bodies being added or
subtracted as needed to regulate the system response to gravity,
a key ﬁnding here is in direct opposition to this hypothesis.
In the same ﬁsh we recorded a substantial aﬀerent population
to acceleration in control ﬁsh and in ﬁsh after 4- or 16-day of
2.24 g exposures, and conducted complete 3D ultrastructural
reconstructions of hair cells in the reversal zone of striola and in
the predominant medial extrastriola region. Aﬀerents had highly
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in Smax (Figure 11A) and average IR per
cycle (Figure 11B) with virtually little to no overlap. Even with
this clear distinction in utricular physiology, SB counts per hair
cell were statistically equivalent in the selected three aﬀerent
populations in both macular regions measured in the same ﬁsh:
hair cells contained on average ﬁve to six synaptic bodies, but the
variation in number was large (Figure 11C). Aﬀerent Smax also
showed a wide variation from less sensitive to highly sensitive
within an individual animal, but were distinctly separated as a
group from the other populations. The importance of this ﬁnding
is that the physiological and anatomical results were obtained in
the same animal, and no direct correlation was found. It might
be argued that the utricular synaptic organization had adapted
over the course of aﬀerent recordings. We saw no indication
of this: aﬀerents after 4 and 16 days of HG were hyper- and
hypo-sensitivity, respectively, from the start to the ﬁnish of the
recordings and require days to readapt to 1 g. Clearly other
factors might be in play. For example, adjustment of synaptic
eﬃcacy or strength might involve many processes other than
the SB itself, such as Hebbian plasticity based on the correlation
of pre- and post-synaptic cells (Matsubara and Uehara, 2016).
Suli et al. (2016) have provided some key insights into synaptic
plasticity in mechanosensory hair cells. Using transgenic and
mutant zebraﬁsh lines they found that innervation was crucial
for regulating the number, size, and localization of ribbons in
maturing lateral line hair cells, and for their maintenance at the
mature synapse. How synaptic weights and innervation patterns
might scale up or down or ﬂuctuate in distribution within
the hair cell–aﬀerent complexes need to be examined in our
model.
(d) A neural feedback circuit. It is remarkable that vertebrates
exert an eﬀerent (EVS) neural control over the sensitivity,
bandwidth, and linearity of sound and motion sensation. In
general, the EVS provides hair cell organs not only with the means
to control passive ﬁltering of sound and motion signals, but also
to regulate the mechanical gain of the living ampliﬁers in the
ear (Hudspeth, 2008; Rabbitt and Brownell, 2011). Eﬀerent cell
bodies are located in the caudal brainstem, a phylogenetically
ancient structure that monitors and controls vital functions
including alertness and arousal. A typical eﬀerent neuron in
toadﬁsh has extensive dendritic arbors spanning the brainstem,
thereby providing the neuron the capability to receive a wealth
of descending command and ascending sensory information
(Highstein and Baker, 1986; conﬁrmed in the present study,
q.v. Supplementary Figure 3). Spatial coding is likely not
selective, since eﬀerent ﬁbers can innervate multiple end organs
on one side or even bifurcate within the brain to innervate

both labyrinths (Schwarz et al., 1981; Eden and Correia, 1982;
Strutz, 1982; Dechesne et al., 1984; Highstein and Baker, 1986;
Valli et al., 1986; Dickman and Correia, 1992; Fujino et al.,
1993; Marco et al., 1993; Birinyi et al., 2001; Chi et al.,
2007).
Does the EVS participate in the adaptive processes observed
after exposures to HG? We addressed this question indirectly
in this study by (1) inferring EVS action on the hair cell by
comparing Smax observed in each experimental group (Table 1),
(2) inferring EVS action on the aﬀerent by comparing average
IR at Smax (IR, in ips/cycle) observed in each experimental
group (Table 1), and (3) pairing the MIR (in ips) with and
without EVS stimulation in absence of acceleration in the
same aﬀerent in each experimental group (Table 2). A more
direct measure to determine EVS role in neural adaptation was
sought, but not found. For example, axons presumed to originate
from eﬀerent neurons were too infrequently encountered and
their discharge had no clear variants to permit a meaningful
comparison among subjects within or across groups, and the
EVS action on aﬀerent sensitivity to acceleration stimuli via
its inﬂuence on hair cell receptor potential could not be
normalized in any meaningful manner, mostly due to the
variability in EVS eﬃcacy and frequency of occurrence within
each ﬁsh.
Eﬀerent vestibular system functional role in nonmammalian
vertebrates is likely linked to innate behaviors, such as
attack and feeding and escape and aversives established for
survival of the animal and its reproduction. In toadﬁsh these
actions are preceded by a stereotypic behavior, and it is
powerfully evoked during the anticipatory phase of production
of large, self-generated, and behaviorally relevant movements
(Boyle and Highstein, 1984, 1990b; Highstein and Baker,
1985; Tricas and Highstein, 1990, 1991). EVS regulation of
aﬀerent sensitivity is likely through its action on hair cell
modulation (Flock and Russell, 1976; Boyle et al., 2009;
Rabbitt et al., 2010; Rohmann et al., 2015; Poppi et al.,
2018). A novel ﬁnding supporting the importance of behavioral
context in EVS function was recently reported by Chagnaud
et al. (2015). In a semi-isolated preparation, which permits
identifying the source of incoming signals, of larval Xenopus
it was shown corollary discharge signals arising from the
spinal central pattern generator cyclically modulated eﬀerent
neurons during ﬁctive swimming. During these phasic epochs
of eﬀerent signaling, there was a corresponding gain reduction
of aﬀerent responses to vestibular-related stimuli. Thus, similar
to toadﬁsh, the EVS of Xenopus can eﬀectively optimize sensory
processing.
No presumed eﬀerent neurons were encountered in the
utricular nerve that consistently responded to applied otolith
(linear acceleration or body roll/pitch) or canal (yaw rotation
or head down/up pitch) stimuli. Given their low discharge at
rest and disregard to benign vestibular stimulation, as well as
the powerful excitation during preparatory behaviors, eﬀerent
neurons likely provide more episodic control over their synaptic
targets and not a tonic inﬂuence. Recent evidence showed
that the EVS could inﬂuence VOR plasticity using the α9
knockout mouse model, particularly after destruction of one
labyrinth (Hübner et al., 2017). Although in a classical sense
the EVS might still provide an underlying tonic drive to its
targets, for the sake of argument in the present context a
drive that also monitors the prevailing gravity condition, it
does not provide cross-talk between otoliths and canals for
continuous passive stimuli or inﬂuence the output during
benign and nonthreatening volitional movements. Viewed
from this perspective the EVS endows the toadﬁsh with a
powerful means to adjust the sensitivity and dynamic range
of motion sensation, and is positioned to monitor prevailing
conditions and regulate the gravity sensation (Kondrachuk and
Boyle, 2006). However, no direct measurements or indirect
inferences from aﬀerent discharge behavior were found here
to suggest a clear EVS role in regulating the utricular
response to altered gravity. The information content provided
by the eﬀerent feedback signal in diverse conditions may
be more complex and involve a novel self-regulation of
synapses induced by changes in input signals in altered
gravity.
