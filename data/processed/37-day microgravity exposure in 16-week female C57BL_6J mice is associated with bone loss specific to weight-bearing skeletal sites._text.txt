Abstract 
Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associ­
ated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms 
of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss 
during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific micrograv­
ity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and 
histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA 
Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical 
bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative 
effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests 
that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely 
to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also 
associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This 
suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary 
ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice 
housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained 
bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone 
mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater 
topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechani­
cal loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our 
results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading 
of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded 
predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we 
identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel

Introduction
Understanding the effects of the spaceflight environment on biological systems is an import­
ant area of research because of health concerns associated with increased human spaceflight 
activities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and in future deep space exploration of the Moon and 
Mars. Our research focuses on the skeletal bone loss observed in mammalian rodent models 
in response to microgravity and space radiation, including their mechanisms of action, and 
their relative contributions to altered skeletal homeostasis. Rigorously investigating the effects 
of spaceflight on bone, however, has proven to be complex because of highly variable space 
experiments conditions, plus technical, logistic and other limitations on the ability to control 
and replicate those experiments.
As a result, reports of spaceflight effects on bone vary; findings range from increases in 
mandibular bone volume to both significant and nonsignificant changes in tibial trabeculae 
and various cortical sites [1–8]. Similarly, meta-analyses of spaceflight bone loss across species 
show variable site-specificity and magnitudes [9,10] of bone structural parameters. The NASA 
Rodent Research validation mission (RR-1) introduced the NASA RH as an ISS National Lab 
facility for rodent studies in order to standardize discrepancies between spaceflight studies 
(Fig 1A). Importantly for experiment design, animals can also be euthanized and dissected 
on orbit, avoiding potential concerns about hypergravity exposure during spacecraft reentry 
in live animal return experiments. The RR-1 experiment included ground-based controls in 
the RH, baseline controls to account for effects of aging over the 37-day study, and vivarium 
controls to reference results to standard vivarium cage mouse housing [11,12] (Fig 1B). In 
our investigation of RR-1 bone tissue samples, we focused on the hindlimb and the spine to 
compare sites of the skeleton predominantly loaded by weight-bearing and muscle activity, 
respectively (Fig 1C). The experiment used mice during the late stages of skeletal maturation, 
that occur between 16 and 21 weeks of age, prior to onset of femoral growth plate closure and 
secondary endochondral ossification (SEO) [13].
A specific focus of our study is the femur because of its major weight-bearing role in the 
mouse. Cancellous regions in the proximal and distal femur provide structural scaffold­
ing during cortical bone growth [14], and are normally atrophied with aging [15,16] post 
skeletal maturation. Similarly to aging, spaceflight induces unrecoverable resorption of 
trabeculae in rodents and humans [17,18] and increases fracture risk in long bones [19]. As 
a primary weight-bearing center in the mouse skeleton [20], the femoral head is an import­
ant study site to understand the effects of disuse on skeletal health. Opposite the femoral 
head, the distal epiphysis of the femur is another site of SEO and direct loading [21] by the 
torsional stress of keeping the hip joint and ankle aligned [22,23]. Unlike cancellous bone, 
the comparably low surface area to volume ratio of cortical bone makes it more resilient to 
bone resorption during spaceflight [18]. Finally, the femoral neck is the thinnest cortical 
region in this bone, and as such, it is the site of most hip fractures in elderly patients [24], 
making it another important analysis site for our study. For contrast to the predomi­
nantly weight-bearing femur, we also analyzed the L2 vertebra in RR-1 mice. In bipedal 
humans, the spine is primarily loaded by the weight of the upper body. In quadrupedal 
rodents, however, the L2 vertebra is thought to be loaded mainly through the articulation 
of the thorax and abdomen via the lumbar and abdominal muscles, rather than serving a 
weight-bearing role.

Microgravity exposure in female mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites
Thus, we hypothesize bone loss in the rodent model is a site-specific phenomenon associ­
ated with mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton, rather than other 
systemic factors. Using standard methodology for the quantification of bone parameters 
with histology and microcomputed tomography (μCT) [25], within the regions of interest 
described in Fig 1C, we conducted global and same-animal paired comparisons of bone 
parameters in the femur and L2 vertebrae sites to rigorously test the idea that bone loss in 
LEO is specific to mechanically unloaded skeletal sites and not due to systemic effects.
Methods
Animals
The bone tissues used in this study were from mice in the NASA RR-1 flight experiment. 
12 week old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were matched 
by weight and assigned to groups (n =  10/group), housed in standard vivarium cages, and 
acclimated for 4 weeks to control experimental conditions, as previously described [11], prior 
to launch at 16 weeks of age. Food and water were available ad libitum and further husbandry 
details have been published [11]. All animal procedures were approved and carried out by 
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the NASA Ames Research 
Center (ARC) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Secondary dissection tissues used in this

study were collected by astronauts on orbit and dissected by the RR-1 Biospecimen Sharing 
Program (BSP) team on the ground. Tissues were awarded by the NASA Ames Life Sciences 
Data Archive (ALSDA) for study to EACA (femur) and JSA (vertebrae). Reduced specimen 
numbers in certain sample groups, such as the femoral head, was due to sample damage that 
occurred during biospecimen sharing dissections.
Rodent habitat
The RR-1 study was the first to utilize and validate NASA’s RH modules for spaceflight 
experiments. These were modified from previous model of AEM to support long-term 
housing aboard the ISS after the end of the STS program. Mice were socially housed at n = 5 
per side of the RH. RHs included new long-duration exhaust filters, refillable water com­
partments, and were equipped with four cameras each to assess rodent health and behavior 
during the experiments. Details of habitat upgrades are found in Table 1 of Choi, S., et al., 
2020 [11].
Spaceflight
Mice were launched into space at 16 weeks of age and flight conditions were replicated in 
controls except for transport to orbit on SpaceX Dragon at twice the normal density using a 
RH Transporter unit on ascent. An Animal Access Unit was used on the ISS to transfer mice 
from the Transporter to the RH and for accessing the mice during the experiment duration. 
A Mouse Transfer Box transported mice from the Transporter or the RH to the Microgravity 
Science Glovebox for injections and on orbit euthanasia when mice were 21 weeks of age [11]. 
Radiation dosimetry on ISS over the duration of the experiment was measured to be about 
7.4 mGy, although shielding by the RH locker and EXPRESS rack likely reduced the radiation 
dose compared to the rest of the ISS [11].
Experimental protocol
RR-1 spaceflight experiments were performed as previously described in detail by Choi, et al 
[11]. In brief, RR-1 used 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice exposed to microgravity for 37 
days on-orbit (FL) in RHs (4 days in flight transit and 33 days on the ISS). A group of ground 
control mice was housed in standard mouse vivarium cages (VIV) while another group was 
housed in RHs (GC) (Fig 1A) inside ISS Environmental Simulator chambers (ISSES). The 
ground control mice were offset by 4 days relative to spaceflight to account for transit time. 
An additional group of basal control mice was euthanized 1 day after launch (BL). All mice 
carcasses were kept at -80oC until FL mice samples were returned to Earth (105 days). Upon 
thawing and dissection, femurs and a section of the lumbar vertebral column were fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde for μCT, and for paraffin embedding plus sectioning, followed by histolog­
ical staining.
Safranin-O staining
The staining of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) using Safranin-O was performed on 6 
μm deparaffinized sections of the femoral head and distal epiphysis to obtain a representative 
sampling of pre-SEO and SEO samples. Cartilage was stained using 0.1% Safranin-O. Bone 
tissue was visualized using polarized light and differential interference contrast (DIC). In each 
animal, a sagittal section of each region was selected for comparisons between experimental 
conditions and the femoral head plus distal epiphysis, was imaged on Zeiss Axioskop micro­
scope in DIC mode with a 20X 0.5 NA Plan NeoFluar lens (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, New York, 
USA) for sGAG content evaluation.

Microcomputed tomography
The right femur from each sample was scanned using Bruker SkyScan 1272 μCT (Kontich, 
Belgium). Scans were performed at 60 kV of x-ray energy with a 0.25 mm thick aluminum 
filter. Images were taken every 0.5 degrees and averaged over 3 frames. Scans using the Sky­
Scan 1272 were conducted at 0.6 μm for the femoral head, 3 μm for the femur, and 4 μm for 
vertebrae. Tomographies were reconstructed with Bruker SkyScan NRecon software and the 
Instarecon reconstruction server (Instarecon Inc., Urbana Illinois) using a ring artifact correc­
tion of 10, and a beam hardening correction of 40%.
Reconstruction and segmentation
Reconstructed μCT images of the femur were uploaded to DataViewer software (Bruker Sky­
Scan, Kontich, Belgium), and reoriented in two parts; one where the z-axis was concentrically 
aligned with the midshaft and distal epiphysis, and one where the z-axis was concentrically 
aligned with the femoral neck. Vertebrae were oriented so both lateral pedicles were parallel. 
Appropriate orientation was confirmed and visualized in 3D using CTVox software (Bruker 
SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium).
Fixed dimension volumes of interest (VOIs) were selected, and bone regions were seg­
mented using CTAn software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) for each of the five selected 
sites. For the L2 vertebrae, a cancellous VOI of 0.6 mm was isolated, extending from the 
caudal growth plate to its connection with the lateral pedicles. The femoral head was analyzed 
with a cancellous VOI of 0.4 mm, defined by the tissue between the end of the metaphyseal 
growth plate and start of the cortical femoral neck. In the femoral neck, a cortical VOI of 
0.14 mm segmented the tissue connecting the end of the femoral head region to the femoral 
shaft. The femoral midshaft was analyzed with a cortical VOI of 0.48 mm, determined by 
averaging the z-position of the proximal and distal ends of the femur. Lastly, the distal femoral 
epiphysis had a cancellous VOI of 1.12 mm, extending from the epiphyseal growth plate 
towards the midshaft (Fig 1C).
Digital image analysis
The BATch MANager program within CTAn, was used to create task lists for 2D and 3D bone 
analyses and executed for each of the VOIs cancellous or cortical region [25], and output 
measurements were obtained for comparison between experimental groups. Cancellous bone 
in the proximal and distal epiphyses was evaluated using percent bone volume (BV/TV, %), 
number of trabeculae per mm (Tb.N, 1/mm), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular 
separation (Tb.Sp, mm), trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf, 1/mm), and connectivity density 
(Conn.D, 1/mm3). Cortical bone was evaluated using percent bone area (BA/TA, %), average 
cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), endosteal perimeter (E.Pm, mm), and periosteal perimeter 
(P.Pm, mm).
Secondary endochondral ossification was visually evaluated in cross-sectional views of the 
femoral head to determining if the epiphyseal growth plate and mineralized distal cartilage 
had been converted to the fully ossified cancellous tissue morphology characteristic of SEO.
Statistical analysis
We used Prism v. 10.1.0 (GraphPad Inc., Boston, Massachusetts), to conduct one-way 
ANOVA tests between each experimental group for each measurement to identify variabil­
ity between their means, with α =  0.05 set for the threshold for significance. Tukey’s Honest 
Significant Difference was implemented for post-hoc analysis, and these p-values were used 
for significance brackets. To evaluate the magnitude of effect between housing type and

spaceflight conditions, the changes of BV/TV in VIV and FL groups relative to GC was calcu­
lated. To compare percent change between groups, a one-sample t-test was implemented with 
a hypothetical mean of zero. A paired t-test was performed between the vertebrae, femoral 
head, and distal epiphysis within the same sample, which evaluated within-subject variation of 
bone volume at weight-bearing versus non-weight-bearing site pairs.
Results
Bone loss in the weight bearing femoral head and distal epiphysis 
cancellous bone regions depends on housing type and spaceflight in 
microgravity
In the femoral head, BV/TV was significantly decreased in spaceflight compared to all control 
environments (BL, −25%; VIV, −18%; GC, −27%) (Fig 2A). FL bones also had significantly 
fewer trabeculae than basal mice (−15%), which was unchanged in the two control habitats 
(Fig 2B). FL bones showed thinner trabeculae (BL, −16%; GC, −17%) (Fig 2C), an increase 
in separation (BL, +26%; GC, +22%) (Fig 2D), and a higher pattern factor (BL, +163%; GC, 
+755%) (Fig 2E) compared to BL and GC bones. Conn.D remained unchanged (Fig 2F). 
Interestingly, the VIV group had nonsignificant trends of similar magnitude in their trabec­
ular metrics indicating loss as observed in the spaceflight group. VIV bones had more space 
between trabeculae than the BL control, which was not reflected in GC indicating a housing 
effect (+18%) (Fig 2D). Overall, the femoral head shows significant bone atrophy expressed in 
multiple bone parameters after 37 days in space (Fig 2G).
At the distal epiphysis, BV/TV was significantly decreased in VIV and FL bones from GC 
levels (VIV, −41%; FL, −55%) (Fig 3A). Similarly to the femoral head, the distal epiphysis 
in spaceflight samples showed fewer trabeculae as compared to BL (−39%) and GC bones 
(−42%), which was not observed in VIV bones (Fig 3B). Though trabecular thickness was 
unchanged (Fig 3C), separation of trabeculae was increased in FL compared to BL and GC 
(BL, +16%; GC, +14%) (Fig 3D). VIV had significantly higher trabecular separation (+12%) 
compared to basal mice, a result which was also observed in the femoral head. Spaceflight 
significantly increased Tb.Pf from GC mice (+27%) (Fig 3E). The FL group had significantly 
lower connectivity density than BL (−50%) and GC (−52%), which was not seen in the VIV 
(Fig 3F). This indicates that GC housing in the RH may rescue aging-related bone loss in 
the distal epiphysis of vivarium cage housed mice. In all trabecular metrics, the VIV group 
experienced loss trends similar to those in FL bones. Collectively, the data suggest, relative to 
the RH, the vivarium cage housing allows aging-related bone loss to progress in the cancellous 
regions of weight bearing bones in the form of fewer trabeculae and fewer plate-like structures 
(Fig 3G).
Long bone cortical tissues undergo degenerative changes in space
The femoral neck experiences compression and bending forces near its connection to the 
femoral shaft. We found that BA/TA is significantly lower in FL compared to VIV, although 
not by a large magnitude (−6%, p <  0.05) (Fig 4A). Ct.Th is not significantly changed between 
groups, though a trend exists such that the VIV group has thicker cortical bone (Fig 4B). E.Pm 
is significantly higher in FL than in all other groups (BL, +50%; VIV, +34%; GC, +43%) (Fig 
4C), where P.Pm remains unchanged (Fig 4D). These results indicate that cancellous struc­
tures in the femoral neck endocortical region may be eroded with spaceflight (Fig 4E).
With the process of aging to skeletal maturity, cancellous scaffolding is reduced, and the 
cortical shell of bones becomes thicker providing more withstanding force against loading 
[26]. This effect is seen between the BL and VIV groups, where BA/TA (+7%, p <  0.005) and

Ct.Th (+7%, p <  0.01) increase with time (Fig 5A-B). Spaceflight significantly inhibits this by 
reducing BA/TA (−6%, p <  0.005) and Ct.Th (−8%, p <  0.005) from VIV levels (Fig 5A-B). 
Unlike in the femoral neck, there were no effects seen in the E.Pm (Fig 5C), which may be due 
to the midshaft region lacking cancellous bone while the femoral neck has residual cancellous

metrics of cancellous bone in the femoral head show that (A) BV/TV is decreased in FL. Bones from FL mice have

(D) Tb.Sp, whereas only FL has an increase in (E) Tb.Pf. (F) Conn.D is not significantly affected; however, VIV and

structures extending from the femoral head. P.Pm remained unchanged in all conditions (Fig 
5D). These results indicate that the femoral midshaft experiences significant cortical thinning, 
which may be attributed to spaceflight (Fig 5E).
Load-bearing vertebrae do not show μCT parameter changes related to age, 
housing, or spaceflight in microgravity
Within the L2 vertebrae, our analysis did not detect statistically significant changes to μCT 
parameters between groups, though there are several nonsignificant trends for small mag­
nitude losses in space. Specifically, parameters like BV/TV, Tb.N, and Tb.Th in FL appear 
slightly decreased (Fig 6A-F), but the variance in measurements prevents any conclusions 
from being drawn. Thus, the L2 vertebrae is not significantly affected by housing type or 
spaceflight, suggesting it is not measurably responsive to weight-bearing load changes.
Decreased mechanical loading during spaceflight in microgravity only 
causes significant bone loss in weight-bearing skeletal sites

weight-bearing spine, the percent change of the BV/TV of GC samples to the average value

Microgravity exposure in female mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites
of FL was compared using a one-sample t-test with a hypothetical mean of zero (Fig 7A). 
The vertebrae had an average change of −7% ±  10% (p =  ns), while the femoral head lost 
27% ±  9% (p <  0.0001) and the distal epiphysis lost 55% ±  10% (p <  0.0001). A paired 
t-test between the vertebrae and either the femoral head (Fig 7B) or distal epiphysis (Fig 
7C) shows significant differences of bone loss within individual samples (p <  0.005). 
Throughout these results, the vivarium group in standard cages also showed bone loss 
effects but smaller in magnitude than spaceflight. Using a one-sample t-test and a paired 
t-test, these trends were quantified. The vertebrae experienced an increase in BV/TV by 
8% ±  8% (p <  0.05), where the femoral head and distal epiphysis demonstrate significant 
bone loss of 12% ±  6% (p <  0.01) and 41% ±  14% (p <  0.0001), respectively (Fig 7D). 
Within samples, these effects were confirmed as all samples experienced similar degrees 
of loss from non-weight bearing vertebrae to the weight-bearing femoral head (p <  0.005) 
(Fig 7E) and distal epiphysis (p <  0.0001) (Fig 7F). Thus, the non-weight-bearing spine 
bone site did not experience significant change in spaceflight while weight-bearing femoral 
regions underwent extensive bone loss, indicating weightlessness may be the primary effec­
tor of bone loss during spaceflight in LEO.

Microgravity exposure in female mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites
between 21 and 23 weeks of age, bones from the VIV group had twice the occurrences of 
ossification within the femoral head than BL, and the data shows the GC habitat somewhat 
rescued this effect. However, FL mice had a 50% ossification rate, 20% above the VIV group, 
suggesting an increased prevalence of premature skeletal maturation. Interestingly, in the 
distal epiphysis, GC and FL, and VIV and BL groups had the same occurrences of ossification 
(Fig 8B), potentially related to distal epiphyseal fusion regulation predominantly by hormonal 
factors versus mechanotransduction [13].
Safranin-O staining of the femoral head revealed that the region consisted entirely of hyper­
trophic cartilage region and a well-defined growth plate between articular cartilage and min­
eralized bone in baseline bones (Fig 9A). Within the VIV group, sGAG content was depleted 
in the articular cartilage due to early signs of ossification relative to other groups, although the 
growth plate remained active (Fig 9B). GC bones had this effect rescued with a maintenance of 
hypertrophic chondrocytes and cartilage (Fig 9C). The FL sample shows that complete ossifi­
cation is associated with full sGAG and chondrocyte activity loss within the femoral head (Fig 
9D). However, the distal epiphysis provides different results based on the state of SEO. From 
BL (Fig 9E) to VIV, both classified as pre-SEO with μCT, there is a decrease in sGAG content 
likely due to aging (Fig 9F). The GC sample, classified as SEO, has slightly less sGAG content 
than VIV, especially in the trabecular region at the top of the image (Fig 9G), however it does

paired t-tests, findings revealed (A) vertebrae showed no significant change, while the (B) femoral head and (C) distal epiphysis 
experienced significant bone loss in spaceflight, suggesting that microgravity unloading, but not other systemic factors, caused bone 
loss in LEO. (D-F) The vivarium cage housing, known to provide reduced topological enrichment, also elicited bone losses of smaller 
magnitude than spaceflight, but only in weight-bearing bone sites.

present a continuous area of mineralized tissue along the growth plate. This plate is marked by 
light pink staining, which is preserved between two continuous areas of bone in the FL example 
at late-stage SEO (Fig 9H). These observations suggest the process of SEO in the distal femur 
may induce more chondrocyte activity to rearrange cancellous structure and close the growth 
plate, however additional studies will be required to elucidate these questions.
Discussion
Spaceflight in LEO is well-documented to cause significant bone loss and is often compared 
to physiologically aged, osteopenic phenotypes [27,28]. NASA’s early systematic studies of 
Fig 8.  Spaceflight in microgravity accelerates secondary endochondral ossification of the proximal epiphysis in 
the femur. FL bones had 50% of their cohort ossified in the (A) femoral head, over twice as many as in GC cohort. 
Differences in ossification at BL (16 weeks) and the other groups (21 weeks) in the (B) distal epiphysis appear inde­
pendent of aging. (C) μCT volumetric reconstructions of the femoral head from a representative sample from each 
group show increased cavitation in the mineralized cartilage of the VIV and FL groups.

spaceflight effects on rodent bone physiology were conducted in short duration Space Shuttle 
Space Transportation System (STS) studies lasting ten to fourteen days using the Animal 
Enclosure Module (AEM) in a mid-deck locker. More recent results, with longer durations 
greater than thirty days on the International Space Station (ISS) use the Rodent Habitat 
hardware (RH), on the EXPRESS rack and broadly show relatively smaller degenerative bone 
losses possibly due to rodent acclimation to microgravity [11,19,29]. These effects are thought 
to be caused throughout bone tissue as a result of cellular proliferation and differentiation 
homeostasis imbalance between bone forming osteoblasts and bone degrading osteoclasts 
[30] with osteocytic osteolysis [31] and apoptosis [32] also playing a role. Exceptions to this 
general assertion have been reported for calvariae [33,34] and mandibles [1,35] with increases 
or maintenance of bone volume during spaceflight, potentially due to greater mechanical 
stimulation from elevated intracranial pressure due to microgravity cephalic fluid shift. How­
ever, these studies mostly measured acute, short-term spaceflight effects during NASA’s Space 
Shuttle (STS) era and have limitations as a model for longer-term exposures more relevant to 
future spaceflight missions. Other experimental variables in spaceflight include species and 
strain, animal age at launch, experiment duration, ambient temperature, humidity, CO2 con­
centrations, sample collection methods during or post-flight, and habitat type used. Like the 
Fig 9.  Spaceflight in microgravity reduces sGAG content in the femoral head and distal epiphysis. Representative 
histology of Safranin-O staining on femoral heads, with the (A) BL as the control, show a decrease of proteoglycan 
content in (B) VIV, a loss of the distinct tidemark in (C) GC, and complete deficit in an ossified sample from (D) FL. 
The distal epiphyses show ossification-dependent changes to the growth plate. During pre-ossification at 21 weeks (F, 
VIV), proteoglycan content decreases and is upregulated during ossification (GC, FL) to finalize remodeling into the 
dual-walled gap characteristic of distal epiphysis secondary ossification.

Microgravity exposure in female mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites
STS AEM, the ISS RH provides a wire-mesh interior, allowing group-housed mice behavior 
and activities with associated mechanical demands similar to ground-based enriched habi­
tats. Such activities include grappling across the cage to access food, climbing the 3D internal 
structure, and uniquely for space flown mice, to run in a loop along the perimeter of the 
habitat [12]. However, these activities only emerged after acclimation to space on days 11 and 
12 in the RR-1 mice [12], where other STS experiments would have already concluded or been 
within a few days of ending.
A fundamental distinction between ground-based spaceflight simulations and low-Earth 
orbit is the type and dosage of radiation. Ground-based simulations often use low LET radi­
ation, such as X-rays, at high acute doses of a few Gray (Gy) [36,37]. In contrast, spaceflight 
radiation is high linear energy transfer (LET), which has been shown to induce bone loss 
when acute doses of 1–2 Gy are administered [38]. However, on the ISS, the total high LET 
radiation dose over 37 days was only ~7.4 mGy, with an average daily dose of 207 µGy [11]. 
This acute dosage in ground simulations is equivalent to ~13 years of radiation exposure on 
the ISS delivered instantaneously. While space radiation is commonly considered a potential 
factor in mediating bone loss in space, the radiation measured over the duration of the RR-1 
experiment in LEO is generally not considered sufficient to cause bone loss [11,39]. Therefore, 
conclusions drawn from ground-based simulations are not directly comparable to spaceflight 
conditions. Although there are other potential factors that can contribute to bone loss in space 
such as reactive oxygen species, calcium secretion, and hormonal imbalances [40–43], all these 
factors are thought to be systemic in the organism and would be expected to cause bone loss 
across the entire skeletal system. Current literature does not provide sufficient evidence to 
suggest that ROS production is site-specific within bone or bone marrow. Both microgravity 
and radiation are systemic factors, leading to the conclusion that ROS production affects the 
skeletal system uniformly. Because of this, we investigated the role of site-specific micrograv­
ity mechanical unloading in mediating bone loss, and we sought to test the hypothesis that the 
effects observed are primarily due to decreased weight-bearing in space and not to other sys­
temic factors. To evaluate these ideas, we conducted μCT analysis on the femoral head, neck, 
midshaft, distal epiphysis, and L2 vertebrae, both from space flown mice and ground control 
animals housed in the topologically enriched RH as well as in standard vivarium cages.
Through aging, rodents experience decreased bone volume fraction and trabecular number 
due to remodeling of the bone favoring periosteal cortical development [44–46]. In contrast, 
dynamic mechanical loading via exercise significantly increases healthy biomechanical prop­
erties of bone [47–49]. The femoral head is also a key site of skeletal development and matu­
ration [50], where secondary SEO of the epiphysis, converts the growth plate and mineralized 
cartilage into cancellous mineralized tissue [51,52]. Concomitantly, the femoral midshaft 
experiences high bending torsional loads during normal ambulation [53], making disuse of 
these areas interesting to compare to other sites of the skeleton that are not weight bearing. In 
the femur shaft, capacity to hold loads is primarily imparted by cortical bone which typically 
reaches maximum thickness after twelve weeks of age[44] with significant thinning of the 
cortical wall not occurring until after eight months of age [54]. Fracture risk is also increased 
with age [55,56] as cortical bone becomes brittle [57–61] with structural disruption [62], likely 
due to dysfunctional remodeling [63,64] that may prevent micro-fracture repair [65]. STS 
missions show insignificant acute changes in cortical bone [17], but long-term loss is resistant 
to post-flight recovery [66]. Thus, vertebrae might reveal potential systemic bone degenerative 
effects not associated with microgravity weightlessness unloading as expected in the femur. 
Furthermore, the RH wire mesh interior is associated with increased mouse physical activity 
that occurs during long-duration spaceflight after initial acclimation [12] and may load this 
region of the spine, possibly attenuating minor weightlessness unloading effects.

Microgravity exposure in female mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites
If space radiation in LEO or other systemic factors were the primary effectors of bone loss 
during spaceflight, we would expect systemic changes to the skeletal system. In that context, 
for ionizing radiation, we might also expect that thick, minerally dense regions of cortical 
bone could partially shield the bone marrow cavity and cancellous bone. This, however, does 
not appear to be the case, as our data shows the vertebral thin cortical and cancellous bone are 
unchanged in spaceflight (Fig 6), but the femoral neck, which has a substantial cortical region, 
experiences endosteal cancellous tissue loss (Fig 4). Therefore, our data strongly indicate 
that spaceflight-induced bone loss, is localized to two well-established direct weight-bearing 
skeletal locations in the femoral head and distal epiphyses. Moreover, the absence of signifi­
cant bone loss in the L2 lumbar vertebra after 37 days of spaceflight is consistent with previous 
scans of L4 archived on NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSD-489, Alwood, et. al.). 
On Earth, the mechanical loading environment within the rodent spinal column is complex, 
including time- and position-varying loads of lateral bending, flexion/extension, and axial 
rotation dependent on the task being performed [67,68]. Despite the variation in the gravity 
vector with respect to the spine orientation, the vertebral body in both humans and quad­
rupeds experiences intermittent compressive forces and display unique fabric orientation of 
the cancellous tissue to the gravity vector while on Earth [68]. The response to spaceflight is 
less understood and likely varies by habitat topology, housing density, age, and experiment 
duration [10]. As active behaviors are abundantly observed in the RR-1 experiment, we infer 
the mice are mechanically loading their vertebral body by compression. In contrast, animals 
housed in the Russian Bion M-1 Habitat, with three mice per enclosure and smooth tubular 
walls resulting in low topological complexity [69], or in the Japanese Habitat Cage Unit, with 
single-housed mice and perforated walls that allowed grappling resulting in medium topolog­
ical complexity [70,71], do not allow for the same running activity. To this effect, mice in the 
Russian Bion M-1 Habitat, significantly lost cancellous bone in the vertebral body compared 
to standard housing conditions [72]. Additionally, previous studies from our group using 
the hindlimb unloading model showed cancellous bone in the lumbar vertebra of male mice 
to be sensitive to musculoskeletal disuse, resulting in bone loss [73]. Taken together with the 
running activities and resulting intermittent compression on the ventral spine during RR-1 
[12], we interpret the hindlimb unloading model to place less of a mechanical demand on the 
vertebral column compared to space flown and running mice.
Furthermore, we used same-animal paired t-test analyses of bone parameters in 
weight-bearing bones such as the femur and load-bearing vertebrae to establish, with greater 
statistical power than one-sample t-test or ANOVA alone, that while the former are subject 
to loss in space, the latter are not. Additionally, bones from mice in the RH show healthier 
parameters in directly loaded regions than those from the vivarium (Fig 7). Systemic effects 
in the vertebrae, if present, should result in weaker cancellous structures and cortical bone 
would not have experienced the magnitudes of endocortical erosion, as shown in our data. We 
acknowledge that other potential systemic changes in bone tissue [74,75] may affect mechan­
ical properties of bone, but the data strongly suggest that increased activity and micrograv­
ity have opposite effects on bone health parameters only at specific locations within weight 
bearing bone and no significant effects in bones primarily loaded by muscle tension, as long 
as the habitat used, such as RH, is permissive of physical activity in space. The totality of the 
data compellingly supports mechanical unloading as the primary effector of bone loss during 
spaceflight in LEO.
This study also reports a previously unknown accelerated SEO effect of spaceflight on the 
femur. The role of SEO is to conclude the lengthening of long bones and serves as a develop­
mental marker for skeletal maturation [51]. This process is likely mediated by transdifferenti­
ation from chondroprogenitors to osteoprogenitors [76,77]. The results of our study suggest

the femoral head initiates SEO with an increase in chondroprogenitor expression evidenced 
by an increase in sGAG content. Images of ossified bone demonstrate that this tidemark is 
propagated through the remaining articular cartilage until mineralized trabeculae constitute 
the entirety of the femoral head. In the distal epiphysis, the upregulation of chondrocyte 
activity is also demonstrated, however the plate does not dissolve to uniform mineralization, 
rather it maintains a layer of sGAGs between the mineralized bone in the marrow cavity and 
mineralized articular cartilage in the condyles. The percentage of SEO bones increased with 
age from BL to VIV groups. Interestingly, the effect of spaceflight on the progression of SEO 
was shown to accelerate complete ossification in the femoral head above the rate observed 
with aging. Concurrently, increased loading via activity experienced in the GC habitat mouse 
bones decreased the occurrence of ossification (Fig 8). Thus, bone mineralization homeostasis 
and SEO onset appears dependent on the magnitude of mechanical loading and unloading. 
Given that accelerated SEO is a significant physiological spaceflight effect, we checked addi­
tional archival μCT datasets. The 30-day Bion M-1 spaceflight experiment 19-week male mice 
also showed accelerated SEO, suggesting this is not an observation unique to the RR-1 study 
(unpublished results). This, however, was not found in other shorter flight experiments such 
as in the STS-131 Mouse Immunology spaceflight experiment with younger 14-week females 
(results in preparation). Common factors between RR-1 and Bion M-1 spaceflight experi­
ments include a duration greater than 30 days both with mice ages nearing the onset of nor­
mal SEO which occurs at 21–23 weeks. Additional studies are needed to fully characterize the 
femoral head metaphyseal plate dynamics throughout the entire SEO process in the context of 
age, sex, and altered weight-bearing loading in microgravity.
This study supports the hypothesis that bone loss effects we observe in the 37-day RR-1 
spaceflight in LEO is site-specific and likely due to mechanical unloading and not space radi­
ation or other systemic factors. It is unlikely that low levels of space radiation, as experienced 
in LEO, could have systemic effects capable of mediating bone loss, as there are no reports 
of simulated space radiation effects at this dose and dose rate in cortical bone or lumbar 
vertebrae. This study, however, does not rule out the likely possibility that longer exposures, 
or more energetic charged particle space radiation outside of LEO will have significant bone 
effects. Additionally, the novel observation of accelerated epiphyseal closure in the femoral 
head primary weight-bearing location in mice, suggests mechanical unloading may accelerate 
SEO of juvenile growing long bones into a prematurely mature state. The totality of the data 
strongly supports mechanical unloading due to weightlessness in microgravity, not radiation 
or other systemic factors, as the primary effector of spaceflight-related bone loss in LEO.
