A detailed understanding of how spaceﬂight affects human health is essential
for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive
multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of
internal tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epi-
genome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the
International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma
cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceﬂight conﬁrms
previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361
cell surface marker antibodies identiﬁes a mitochondrial DNA-enriched frac-
tion associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the
CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma
mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our
plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission,
which had used on-board artiﬁcial gravity, and discover a link between
microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses.
A detailed understanding of how the human body responds to
spaceﬂight will be important to develop countermeasures for long-
term space exploration1. Without effective solutions for aerospace
health ailments, increasingly critical challenges will manifest as
humanity ventures into crewed interplanetary travel. Solid biopsies
have traditionally served as the gold standard for molecular monitor-
ing of human physiology, but such invasive procedures require spe-
cialized equipment and carry an increased risk of infection and
regional pain. To circumvent these difﬁculties, researchers on Earth
have started to use blood or ﬂuid samples, which are simpler to per-
form and require little to no recovery time, allowing for increased
temporal resolution of sampling. These minimally invasive “liquid
biopsies” permit the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids2,3, which are
thought
to
detect
changes
earlier
than
conventional
protein
biomarkers4 and to better resolve molecular heterogeneity than stan-
dard tissue biopsies5. Cell-free nucleic acids have emerged as potential
space-relevant biomarkers of psychosocial and physical stress6, aging7,
metabolic disorders8, and inﬂammation9, and have already been suc-
cessfully utilized in various terrestrial healthcare contexts, including
screening for infections10, diagnosing cancer11, and monitoring cancer
recurrence and therapy12. On a similar note, cell-free nucleic acids can
infer well-documented spaceﬂight responses, such as DNA damage13,14,
in distal tissues without the need for invasive tissue biopsies15, which
would be particularly difﬁcult to conduct in orbit.
Longitudinal and full-body molecular proﬁling using cell-free
nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue

for advancing space healthcare. This approach may grant a detailed
understanding of how the human body responds to the space envir-
onment and the development of modern countermeasures. Consent-
ing astronauts could participate in lifetime surveillance through annual
liquid biopsies, which could reveal the degree of full recovery from
spaceﬂight responses, such as DNA damage and clonal hematopoiesis
(CH), the latter of which causes increased lifelong risk of cardiovas-
cular disease and blood cancers16,17. Liquid biopsies may be particularly
constructive during interplanetary spaceﬂight missions, in which
orbital healthcare autonomy will need to be optimized due to the large
distance away from Earth. With the advent of the portable, nanopore-
based Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, nucleic acids could
potentially be extracted and directly sequenced in-ﬂight by crew to
monitor their own health in near real time18–20.
The NASA Twins Study provided a unique opportunity to perform
a multi-omics analysis with monozygotic twin astronauts, where one
participant resided on the ISS for 340 days, and the other remained on
Earth16. The past few years have now welcomed the ﬁrst studies to
examine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in astronauts, using data from the
NASA Twins Study21 and data collected 20 years prior with 14 astro-
nauts on short-term missions22. These studies highlighted a theme of
mitochondrial stress as a consistent spaceﬂight phenotype23, with bulk
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) revealing mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) spikes during ﬂight,
the levels of which were correlated to time spent on the ISS24, and
plasma analysis revealing cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA)
spikes during ﬂight21 and in the immediate days after return22.
Here, we report an independent study with six astronaut partici-
pants, where we examined plasma cfRNA proﬁles that reﬂect the
longitudinal responses of internal tissues to the spaceﬂight environ-
ment. To disentangle microgravity from the various factors of the
spaceﬂight environment, we directly compared our human plasma
cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a published JAXA
spaceﬂight mission that incorporated an artiﬁcial gravity device
installed on the Japanese ISS Kibo Experiment Module25. Through this
process, minimally invasive approaches were used in both species to
gain a comprehensive overview of conserved environmental responses
to microgravity, with increased mitochondrial components in plasma
being one such prominent response.
Results
Plasma cfRNA analysis of six astronauts
Blood samples were collected from six astronauts before, during, and
after spaceﬂight on the ISS. An 11-time point sampling course was
designed to capture the pre-ﬂight baseline, the early to late phases of
more than 120 days on the ISS, and the early to late phases of read-
aptation in the ﬁrst 120 days after ﬂight (Fig. 1a). Total cfRNA and
cfDNA were puriﬁed from plasma samples and their yields were
determined (Supplementary Fig. 1). To verify overall sample quality,
real-time PCR analysis was performed to measure the ratio of chro-
mosomal to mitochondrial DNA in total cfDNA. Relative copy numbers
of mitochondrial DNA in plasma signiﬁcantly increased during space-
ﬂight but returned to baseline levels in post-ﬂight samples (Fig. 1b),
similar to previous reports21.
All 66 cfRNA samples were processed for RNA-seq analysis. Data
quality was assessed based on visualization of mapped reads and
principal component analysis (PCA) plots (Supplementary Figs. 2, 3).
Two samples (one pre- and one post-ﬂight) were removed from further
analysis due to low sequencing library yield and poor mapping quality.
PCA plots indicated variations between the six astronauts in the pre-
ﬂight phase. As these variations caused difﬁculties in deﬁning pre-ﬂight
baselines, pairwise comparisons of cfRNA proﬁles using pre-ﬂight
baseline samples were not effective (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Sup-
plementary Data 1). However, RNA proﬁles showed distinct differences
between in-ﬂight and post-ﬂight samples. This allowed us to effectively
identify altered RNA species between in-ﬂight and post-ﬂight phases,
even with the relatively small number of six astronauts participating in
our study (Fig. 1c, d). All time points were consolidated into pre-, in-,
and post-ﬂight groups. Statistical analysis was performed to identify
466 differentially represented cfRNAs (DRRs) (ANOVA tool in CLC
Genomics Workbench, FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.05, |fold change| > 2, |
difference| > 50, Supplementary Data 2). Groups of genes with similar
fold-change values were identiﬁed through scatterplots, where they
formed quasi-straight lines that deviated from the 45-degree diagonal
(Fig. 1d). Prominent examples included cfRNAs from mitochondrial
genes (13 DRRs) and cfRNAs from mucin family genes (8 DRRs), which
were increased and decreased respectively during spaceﬂight (Fig. 1d).
Subplots e–j in Fig. 1 show normalized quantiﬁcation values for indi-
vidual cfRNA species based on mapped genes throughout the time
course. cfRNAs from a subset of mitochondria-encoded genes were
consistently elevated from in-ﬂight +5 days, reaching a peak at in-ﬂight
+30 days, and decreasing at post-ﬂight +3 days. cfRNAs from mucin
gene family members decreased during spaceﬂight and increased
transiently during the post-ﬂight phase.
Molecular pathways affected by spaceﬂight
cfRNA provides a unique opportunity to estimate molecular changes
occurring in the internal tissues of the human body. To explore the
functional categories of altered cfRNAs, a pathway analysis was per-
formed using Metascape 3.526. Consistent with the alteration of mito-
chondrial RNAs, enrichment of pathways related to reactive oxygen
species (ROS) was detected (Fig. 2a). Identiﬁcation of pathways related
to the nervous system, including behavior, regulation of synapse
organization, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and the
neuronal system, indicated that blood sampling successfully mon-
itored molecular responses in nervous tissues. Tissue-speciﬁcity ana-
lysis further supported the alteration of skeletal muscle and the
cerebellum (Fig. 2b). Correlation analysis of the 466 DRRs indicated
two major coregulated cfRNA clusters (Supplementary Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Data 3). Mitochondrial RNAs were clustered together,
but cfRNAs linked to other pathway terms did not show clear
segregation.
Time-course proﬁles of cfRNAs linked to these tissue processes
indicated that baseline levels of these RNAs tended to decrease
during spaceﬂight and recover during post-ﬂight phases (Fig. 2c–k).
Cerebellum-related genes calcium voltage-gated channel subunit
alpha1 A (CACNA1A), HR (HR lysine demethylase and nuclear
receptor corepressor), immunoglobulin superfamily member 9B
(IGSF9B), and paired box 6 (PAX6) and skeletal muscle-related
genes immunoglobulin-like and ﬁbronectin type III domain con-
taining 1 (IGFN1), ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR), and xin actin-binding
repeat containing 1 (XIRP1) showed reduction during spaceﬂight.
RNA levels of these genes showed a rapid increase at post-ﬂight +3
days and decreased by post-ﬂight +120 days. Skeletal muscle-
related genes MAP3K7CL (MAP3K7 C-terminal like) and SH3BGRL
(SH3 domain binding glutamate-rich protein like) showed opposite
changes, with increased representation during spaceﬂight. Similar
to mitochondrial RNAs, there were delays in the changes of RNA
levels for tissue-speciﬁc genes during the transition from pre-ﬂight
to in-ﬂight phases, but re-adaptation responses to the ground
environment were faster.
cfRNAs from genes involved in the vitamin D receptor signaling
pathway, KANK2 (KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 2), MN1 (MN1
proto-oncogene, transcriptional regulator), RXRA (retinoid X receptor
alpha), and TRIM24 (tripartite motif containing 24), included a nuclear
receptor and co-regulators. These RNA species were also altered in
opposite directions between in-ﬂight and post-ﬂight phases (Fig. 2l–o).
Vitamin D plays a central role in inter-organ communication through
hormones secreted by the parathyroid gland, which regulates skeletal
and muscular health27. Changes in cfRNAs derived from these

regulatory genes may indicate systemic shifts in mineral and metabolic
homeostasis in space.
To further evaluate the feasibility of cfRNA-based internal tissue
monitoring, we decided to detect tissue- or cell-type-speciﬁc genes in
the cfRNA-seq data using more strict criteria. As comprehensive
human gene expression databases combined with single-cell RNA-seq,
lists of genes with tissue-enriched and tissue-restricted expression
were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)28. Out of the 466
genes derived from our cfRNA analysis, 57 genes were tissue-enriched
and 10 of them were detected in a single tissue (Fig. 3a).The majority of
cfRNAs from these genes showed relatively low counts, likely due to
the minor contribution of cfRNAs originating from each tissue type,
but they did show consistent changes throughout the sampling time
course (Fig. 3b–f) among the six astronauts. Mapped reads were

visually inspected (Fig. 3g–k) as we did not have enough materials to
perform PCR-based validation for multiple RNA species. To verify
tissue-speciﬁcity with an independent database, tissue-speciﬁc genes
from the HPA were compared to the Genotype-Tissue Expression
(GTEx, https://gtexportal.org/) database record (Fig. 3l–p). RNA
expressions from the DNM3 (dynamin 3), C1QL3 (complement C1q 3),
and AMER2 (APC member recruitment protein 2) genes were highly
enriched in the brain and pituitary. RNAs from the KRT2 (keratin 2) and
MUC5B (mucin 5B) genes were expressed speciﬁcally in the skin and
minor salivary glands among the tissues and cell types included in the
HPA and GTEx database. These results support that our cfRNA-based
liquid biopsy approach allowed for the detection of spaceﬂight-
associated responses in non-blood tissues.
Isolation of mitochondrial fraction
An increase in plasma cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA indicated
the presence of extracellular mitochondria (exMT) or the release of
cytosolic mitochondrial components into the bloodstream during
spaceﬂight. As unprotected nucleic acids in plasma are expected to be
highly unstable, we hypothesized that cfDNA and cfRNA derived from
mitochondria may be protected inside extracellular vesicles (EVs). We
decided to isolate such EVs based on cell surface antigens for further
characterization, as previously described29. To identify potential sur-
face markers of EVs containing mitochondrial components, a panel of
361 antibodies was screened for enrichment of mtDNA (Fig. 4a).
Antibodies were pooled and mixed with in-ﬂight and post-ﬂight plasma
samples, and antibody-bound materials were puriﬁed. Real-time PCR
was used to evaluate the recovery of mtDNA in each puriﬁed material.
Through three rounds of antibody screenings, only one antibody, the
anti-CD36 antibody, consistently enriched mtDNA (Fig. 4b–d). This
enrichment was speciﬁc to in-ﬂight plasma samples, consistent with
the idea that mitochondrial components released in space are asso-
ciated with CD36 as a surface molecular marker.
exMT release and inter-organ trafﬁcking have been reported in
the context of metabolic stress responses and internal tissue damage
associated with ischemia in the heart, adipose tissue, kidney, lung, and
brain30–36. Cytosolic release of mitochondrial components has been
reported in the context of various mitochondrial dysfunctions, which
could be subsequently released as EVs during cell death37. To investi-
gate the potential tissue origins of the mitochondrial components in
plasma, RNA was isolated from the puriﬁed fraction and analyzed by
RNA-seq. RNAs from 406 genes were enriched in the CD36 fraction
(Fig. 4e, CLC Genomics Workbench, Empirical analysis of DGE, FDR-
adjusted P-value < 0.05, |fold change| > 2, Supplementary Data 4). A
tissue-speciﬁcity analysis using Database for Annotation, Visualization
and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tools38,39 revealed that the RNAs in
the CD36 fraction isolated from in-ﬂight plasma samples were derived
from genes with diverse tissue-speciﬁcities. The list of tissues included
the brain, skeletal and heart muscles, and relatively minor tissue types,
including the retina, choroid plexus, tongue, skin, and neuroendocrine
organs, namely, the pituitary, thyroid, and parathyroid glands (Fig. 4f,
Supplementary Data 5). Some of these tissue types have not been
previously analyzed, even in mouse spaceﬂight missions. One advan-
tage of plasma fractionation using the anti-CD36 antibody was the
successful identiﬁcation of enriched RNAs that were not detectable
using bulk cfRNA-seq. For example, RNAs encoded by retinal pigment
epithelium-speciﬁc
65 kDa
protein,
retinoid
isomerohydrolase
(RPE65), a component of the visual cycle of the retina thatis mutated in
hereditary retinal dystrophy40, and photoreceptor cell components
peripherin 2 (PRPH2) and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit beta
1 (CNGB1), both associated with retinitis pigmentosa41,42, were speciﬁ-
cally found in the CD36 fraction.
To estimate the tissue-speciﬁcity of the RNAs, expression proﬁles
of RNAs enriched in the CD36 fraction were obtained from the GTEx
database. The resulting heatmap revealed subsets of genes highly
speciﬁc to the cerebellum and brain (Fig. 4g). Other RNAs were also
speciﬁc to the heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pituitary gland, skin, thyroid
gland, and arteries. When the CD36 fraction was puriﬁed from post-
ﬂight plasma samples, platelet, and megakaryocyte-related RNAs were
co-puriﬁed as veriﬁed by RNA-seq analysis (data not shown). These
results indicated that mitochondrial components were released into
the plasma during spaceﬂight as components of CD36-marked EVs, but
that this fraction was distinct from EVs derived from platelet
degranulation43,44. It is also noted that none of the antibodies against
other established platelet surface markers included in the antibody
panel could enrich mtDNA in our screening45.
Although CD36 is known as a membrane-bound cell surface pro-
tein, it is unclear if the cell-free mtDNA and RNAs were derived from
intact exMT or cytosolic mitochondrial components, as is reported in
cells under various states of stress37. To characterize the CD36 fraction,
we examined the status of the mtDNA by sequencing the cfDNA in the
CD36 fraction. Fig. 5a shows that the entire mitochondrial genome was
contained in the CD36 fraction, which was also supported by the
overall similarity of the sequencing read representation between the
input and the CD36 fraction. However, it was noticed that the read
coverage was higher around the Termination Associated Sequences
(TAS) adjacent to the Displacement-loop (D-loop) region. This region
contains multiple regulatory cis-elements, including the Conserved
Sequence Block (CSB) and promoters for mitochondrial gene
transcription46–48. Altered sequencing coverage in this region could be
due to differences in the regulatory status of the mitochondrial gen-
ome. Differences in DNase accessibility may result in shifts in the
fragmentation status of puriﬁed cfDNA, which affects the efﬁciency of
cfDNA conversion into sequencing libraries (see the “Methods” section
for DNA size selection procedures). The D-loop is also reported to
show altered DNA accessibility in high-resolution mitochondrial DNA
packaging proﬁles49.
Mitochondrial
RNAs

transcriptional
and
post-
transcriptional control and are correlated with cell types and disease
conditions50–52. We performed RNA-seq analysis on the CD36 fraction
with extended samples to cover six astronauts over pre-, in-, and post-
ﬂight phases. Fig. 5b shows the normalized quantiﬁcation values for all
the mtRNAs from genes encoding core subunits of the oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Clustering these mtRNAs indi-
cated different tendencies between the RNAs from the MT-ATP8, MT-
ND3, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6 genes. Direct plotting of normalized RNA
quantiﬁcation values in Fig. 5c–n showed that ratios among mtRNAs
were different between the bulk plasma cfRNA samples and the RNAs
puriﬁed from the CD36 fraction in a subset of genes. For example,
ratios of normalized quantiﬁcation values between MT-ND4 and MT-

MT-ND6 normalized quantiﬁcation values in the CD36 fraction were
2.57-fold larger than in the bulk plasma cfRNA (Fig. 5d). ND6 has been
reported as an important factor in human diseases52,53, and speciﬁc

has

mitochondrial DNAs and RNAs contained in the CD36 fraction.
Cross-species comparison of blood samples
Blood is an important sample type that can directly link humans and
other species in a minimally invasive fashion. Sample collection in
humans is highly limited in space, but time-course sampling from the
same astronaut compensates for the small number of participants and
creates biological replicates for each subject. The increased sample
volume in humans is also advantageous for multi-omics analysis and

the fractionation of plasma and other components. Model organism
data can provide samples from genetically consistent backgrounds,
and time-course sampling can again reduce the number of subjects
and hardware needed. In addition to these technical improvements,
blood sampling reduces localized pain and infection rates compared
to more invasive methods, and hence, it may bring fewer ethical
complications compared to traditional techniques16.
We compared our astronaut blood samples to mouse blood
samples from a published 35-day Mouse-Habitat Unit-1 (MHU-1)
2016 JAXA mission to the ISS [25] (Fig. 6a). Ground control (GC)
samples had been derived from the same genetic background.
Artiﬁcial gravity (AG) conditions used rotating platforms to create
1-G gravity controls on the ISS, allowing for the evaluation of gravity
effects, while controlling for other ﬂight-related environmental
stress factors, such as CO2 concentration, air pressure, isolation,
and noise levels.
RNA-seq analysis was performed on the plasma cfRNA mouse
data. Similar to our human data, RNAs encoded by mitochondrial
genes MT-Cytb (cytochrome b, mitochondrial), MT-Nd1, and MT-Nd4
(mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1 and 4) were upre-
gulated in the MG condition compared to the AG condition (Fig. 6b–d).
By pairwise comparisons among GC, AG, and MG groups, 467 DRRs
were identiﬁed (Fig. 6e, CLC Genomics Workbench, Empirical Analysis
of DGE, P-value < 0.05, |fc| > 1.5, Supplementary Data 6).
To evaluate common molecular changes between species, the 467
mouse cfRNA DRRs were converted into 444 human homologs using
Metascape gene ID conversion. However, only 14 genes (3.1%) were
common to the 466 DRRs identiﬁed in our human cfRNA analysis. To
compare DRRs at the pathway level, enrichment of human disease
terms for DRRs between AG vs. MG and GC vs. MG, which are expected
to represent the impact of gravity change and the general spaceﬂight
environment respectively, was performed using the DisGeNET data-
base analysis in Metascape. We found that 60 out of 121 (49.6%) AG vs
MG (gravity-linked) disease terms were also observed in our human
analysis (Fig. 6f). In contrast, 16 out of 91 (17.6%) GC vs MG (general
spaceﬂight-linked) disease terms were observed in our human analysis
(Fig. 6f). These results indicated the presence of common disease-
related molecular changes as being speciﬁcally associated with the
microgravity factor of spaceﬂight. These disease terms contained
previously reported space-related health risks, including muscle atro-
phy and impairments to the visual system, cardiovascular system, and
neurological system54–58 (Fig. 6g).
Discussion
Consistent with reports from the NASA Twins Study21, we found a
signiﬁcant increase in relative mitochondrial DNA copy numbers
within cfDNA during spaceﬂight but a return to baseline levels in post-
ﬂight samples (Fig. 1b). Another recent study similarly found a sig-
niﬁcant increase in cell-free mitochondrial DNA in the plasma of 14
astronauts shortly after landing, although the authors only examined
three time points (10 days before launch, day of landing, and 3 days
after return)22. Our results indicated that the samples collected in our
study could be a promising resource to further characterize molecular
events associated with spaceﬂight across a wider range and larger
number of time points.
Here, we also show prominent changes in the cfRNA proﬁles of six
astronauts undergoing long-duration spaceﬂight on the ISS. An
increase in plasma mitochondrial components was supported by
plasma mtDNA copy numbers and RNAs from mitochondrial genes.
Screening with antibodies recognizing cell surface markers identiﬁed
CD36, and the isolated plasma fraction contained RNA species from
genes representing a broad range of tissue speciﬁcities. These results
not only support the practical use of relatively less invasive blood
sampling and liquid biopsy analysis to monitor physiological changes
in astronauts but also provide insights into previously uncharacterized
tissue types and molecular processes in the human body affected by
spaceﬂight.
cfRNA proﬁles indicated two distinct modes of molecular changes
associated with spaceﬂight. One group of cfRNAs was represented by
mtRNAs which increased in plasma during spaceﬂight. Another group
of cfRNAs was represented by RNAs encoded by mucin genes which
decreased during spaceﬂight. As DNA and RNA molecules exposed to
plasma are thought to be highly unstable due to the nuclease activity,
we speculated cell-free mtDNAs and mtRNAs in plasma may exist as
contents of EVs. Through screening a panel of antibodies, we identiﬁed
anti-CD36 antibodies that enriched cf-mtDNA from spaceﬂight plasma
samples. In this study, we could not obtain conclusive results to
determine whether plasma mitochondrial components represented
intact exMTs or cytosolic mitochondrial DNAs and RNAs included in
EVs. exMT release into plasma under metabolic stress and tissue injury
has been proposed as a defensive mechanism, whereby damaged
mitochondria are ejected to protect host cells32,59. Mitochondrial DNA
released into the cytosol is posited as one of the damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immune pathways60.
Multiple studies suggest inter-cellular trafﬁcking of damaged mito-
chondria and ROS as a signal to induce resistance against metabolic
stress in distal cells and organs31,61. Our results support that a broad
range of tissues release mitochondrial components into the plasma
during spaceﬂight, which may indicate systemic metabolic stress
responses in the human body under microgravity. Although the
mechanisms and biological signiﬁcance are unclear, mitochondrial
components and tissue-speciﬁc RNAs could serve as candidate bio-
markers to evaluate internal tissue responses in space, and potentially
shed light on recent proposals that mitochondrial dysregulation is a
central feature that accelerates spaceﬂight health risks23.
CD36 has been well studied as a scavenger receptor expressed on
various cell types. Although a direct link between CD36-expressing EVs
and the release of mitochondrial components has not been reported,
CD36 EVs have been described in the context of tissue injury and stress
responses62. The release of CD36-expressing EVs from endothelial cells
and skeletal muscles has been reported63,64. Therefore, it is reasonable
to infer that the CD36 fractions isolated from spaceﬂight plasma
samples represent CD36 EVs that contain mtRNA and other RNAs
derived from the nuclear genomes in their corresponding cells of
origin. Our DNA and RNA-seq analysis of the CD36 fraction indicated
qualitative differences in the mtDNAs and mtRNAs between the bulk
plasma and CD36 fraction samples. Given that transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial gene expression has
been described in the context of tissue-speciﬁcity and disease
conditions50–52, further characterization of the CD36 fraction may

provide clues to understanding spaceﬂight-associated mitochondrial
responses.
Tissue-speciﬁc RNAs identiﬁed space environmental responses in
previously not well-characterized tissue types. The pituitary gland,
thyroid gland, and parathyroid gland are thought to play central roles
in the maintenance and alteration of homeostasis in space, but their
small tissue sizes typically prevent their molecular analysis in animal
models. These tissues are also inaccessible by direct sampling. It
should be noted that the changes in the cfRNA proﬁles may represent
altered tissue contributions as well as RNA expression changes in
internal tissues, but our current study has limitations in distinguishing
these possibilities.
cfRNAs from mucin family genes were previously not well char-
acterized in the context of spaceﬂight response. The mucin genes
detected in our study revealed a broad range of tissue-speciﬁcities,
including the highly tissue-restricted MUC5B (Fig. 3p). Mucins are
known to play protective roles in epithelial tissues65. Gravity imposes
mechanical loading on the entire body, and mucin is expected to be
one of the critical components of biolubricants66. Therefore, the
changes in mucins that we observed may be related to gravity
responses. Mucins are also important for functioning as barriers
against external pathogens and for protecting tissues against dehy-
dration and adhesion. Our results could highlight the signiﬁcance of
mucins in the maintenance of tissue integrity, and in the controlling of
immunological, physical anti-friction, and anti-adhesion functions,
through the maintenance of surface tension under the altered gravity
environment.
It is unclear if the two modes of cfRNA responses to spaceﬂight, an
increase in mitochondrial components in plasma cfDNA and cfRNA
and a decrease in other cfRNAs derived from internal tissues, are
mechanistically related. It is also interesting that the tissue-speciﬁcity
proﬁles of both groups of cfRNAs are similar, with brain and skeletal
muscle as the most prominent tissue types. One of the potential
explanations could be altered properties of blood–tissue barrier (BTB)
functions. Recent studies reported altered integrity of the blood–brain
barrier and blood–retinal barrier in space67,68. It is intriguing to note
that both studies showed an association between oxidative stress and
altered BTB-related molecular processes in space. Murakami et al. have
reported seminal studies that directly linked gravity and environ-
mental stressors to BTB regulation and inﬂammatory responses in the
central nervous system (CNS), a process called the gateway reﬂex69–71.
Thus, it is possible that the reduced release of cfRNAs from the brain
into the plasma could be caused by a reduction in the BTB exchange of
cfRNA-containing EVs triggered by microgravity or environmental
stresses. As the gateway reﬂex is linked to pro-inﬂammatory signals
through “IL-6-ampliﬁer activation”, potential correlations to neuro-
inﬂammatory responses in the brain and retinal tissues could be the
targets for further analysis.
Although the fractionation process in our study was limited by the
panel of antibodies used, our results motivate future developments
and applications of high-deﬁnition liquid biopsies combined with the
fractionation of EVs. As more cell-speciﬁc surface markers become
annotated, the resolution of fractionation will likely improve. Sup-
porting these ideas, we performed another attempt at screening using
nuclear-encoded RNAs and identiﬁed multiple antibodies that enri-
ched different RNA contents from in-ﬂight and post-ﬂight plasma
samples (unpublished results). Either way, improvement in these bio-
molecular technologies will in turn enable the detection of cell-type-
speciﬁc gene expression through liquid biopsies, which can be applied
for minimally invasive health monitoring and clinical sample analysis
on Earth and in space.
As a speciﬁc clinical example, the plasma mtDNA-enriched CD36
fraction isolated from in-ﬂight plasma samples contained tissue-
speciﬁc RNAs indicating eye-related origins (Fig. 4f), and visual dis-
eases were also represented among the gravity-linked terms (Fig. 6g).
These ﬁndings indicate a possibility that liquid biopsies could be useful
to detect early molecular events associated with retina tissue damage.
Spaceﬂight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is one of the
puzzling health issues in astronauts55. SANS is present in some astro-
nauts after short and long duration spaceﬂight55 and is deﬁned as a
constellation of unusual clinical ﬁndings, including optic disc edema,
globe ﬂattening, choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error
shifts, and nerve ﬁber layer infarcts72. The cause of SANS remains
elusive, but two main hypotheses include elevated intracranial pres-
sure (ICP) and compartmentalization of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) to
the area behind the globe73. Our study allowed for the resolution of
gene expression in tissues that are traditionally difﬁcult to access in
humans, such as the retina and choroid plexus, both of which may be
relevant to the study of SANS pathophysiology. Mitochondrial
responses and ROS have been reported as characteristic features of
neuro-inﬂammation in CNS and retinal diseases74. These changes have
also been observed in mouse spaceﬂight experiments67,75. These stu-
dies, collectively, could suggest mitochondria-related processes,
including the ROS and OXPHOS systems, as potential targets for
countermeasure development to prevent health problems associated
with spaceﬂight76,77. Overall, this example underlines that minimally
invasive liquid biopsies could elucidate new perspectives on the cause
of and countermeasures for unique space-related ailments.
This study provided a unique opportunity to compare plasma
cfRNA between mammalian species in a minimally invasive manner.
The space environment consists of many factors, including micro-
gravity, radiation, conﬁnement, noise, altered air pressure and com-
position, and stress factors associated with launch and return. The use
of on-board artiﬁcial 1-G controls in the published MHU-1 mission
allowed us to identify gene categories speciﬁcally affected by the
factor of microgravity, and nearly half (49.6%) of the enriched human
disease terms were also observed in our human ﬂight data. These
gravity-linked terms were not limited to conventional disuse functions,
such as bone and muscle loss, but also included metabolic stress
responses, neurological disorders, and importantly, ocular and cardi-
ovascular dysfunctions. With the development of sophisticated liquid
biopsy technologies combined with multi-omics approaches, the rapid
development of human research in space is expected to provide
important
insights
that
beneﬁt
human
health
both
on
and
beyond Earth.
Methods
Study registration and ethics
The current human spaceﬂight study was proposed to and supported
by the 2014 International Life Sciences Research Announcements,
JAXA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Ethics committee approvals were obtained at the University of Tsu-
kuba, Institute of Medicine, Ethics Committee (No. 251, November 27,
2015), JAXA Institutional Review Board for Human Research (JX-IRBA-
20–071, August 30, 2016), NASA Institutional Review Board (Pro1995,
February 28, 2017), and European Space Agency (ESA) Medical Board
(2017_04_09, April 20, 2017). Informed consent was obtained by the
personal information manager of the study, and de-identiﬁed samples
were made available to researchers who performed sample processing
and data analysis. The study design and conduct complied with all
relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants
and was conducted in accordance with the criteria set by the
Declaration of Helsinki. The previously published Mouse Habitat Unit-1
(MHU-1) spaceﬂight mission is described by Shiba et al.25.
Sample collection and transportation
Human blood samples were collected using Vacutainer EDTA-plasma
separate gel collection tubes (BD, cat. no. 362788) and frozen at −95 °C
(ISS) or −80 °C (ground) after centrifugation for 30 min at 1239×g
(3800 rpm, ISS) or 1600×g (ground). Frozen samples were transported

to the University of Tsukuba after all samples were collected from the
six astronauts. Mouse blood samples were collected from the inferior
vena cava under anesthesia, and transferred into a 1.5 ml microfuge
tube containing EDTA-2K for a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM. Plasma was
obtained by centrifugation at 1500×g for 10 min, and collected into a
fresh tube. A 100 μl aliquot was frozen and transported to the Uni-
versity of Tsukuba.
RNA puriﬁcation
Plasma sample tubes were thawed on ice, aliquoted, and frozen at
−80 °C. Plasma sample aliquots (120 μl) were thawed on ice, and cen-
trifuged at 2000×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and
100 μl supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with 1 ml TRIzol-
LS (Life Technologies, cat. no. 10296028). 200 μl of chloroform was
added to the TRIzol sample, vortex mixed, and spun at 16,000×g for
15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with 1 μl
of glycogen (10 mg/ml stock, Roche, cat. no. 1091393001). 500 μl of
isopropanol was added, mixed, and incubated for 10 min at room
temperature. RNA pellets were recovered following centrifugation at
16,000×g for 15 min and the removal of supernatants. Pellets were
washed twice with 80% ethanol. RNA was resuspended in 8 μl of water.
RNA concentrations were measured using the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit
(Invitrogen, cat. no. Q32852). Mouse plasma RNA was puriﬁed using
the same method as human plasma RNA, except that, after the removal
of cell debris, 50 μl of plasma aliquots were resuspended with 750 μl of
TRIzol-LS and 200 μl of water.
DNA puriﬁcation
Cell debris was removed from the 120 μl plasma aliquot as described
for the RNA puriﬁcation, and 150 μl of SDS-Lysis Buffer (50 mM
Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS), 250 μl of TE Buffer (10 mM
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA), and 10 μl of Pronase stock (Pronase from
Streptomyces griseus, Roche Diagnostics, cat. no. 10165913103, dis-
solved in water at 20 mg/ml) were added and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h.
To extract DNA, 500 μl of Phenol-CHCl3-Isoamylalchol (Wako, cat. no.
311-90151) was added and vortex mixed. The mixture was spun for
5 min at 16,000×g. The supernatant was transferred into a fresh 1.5 ml
tube with 15 μl of 5 M NaCl and 1 μl of glycogen (10 mg/ml stock,
Roche, cat. no. 1091393001). 1 ml of ethanol was added, mixed, and
incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA pellet was
recovered by centrifugation at 16,000×g for 30 min. The supernatant
was removed, and the pellet was washed with 80% ethanol. DNA was
resuspended in 20 μl of water. The DNA concentration was measured
by the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, cat. no. Q33230). The
quality of the puriﬁed RNA was examined by the RNA 6000 Pico Kit
(Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5067-1513).
Mitochondrial DNA quantiﬁcation and statistical analysis
As described previously78, mitochondrial DNA and host cell genome
copy numbers were quantiﬁed using the following primer pairs:
MT-ND1 gene, ND1 forward, 5′-CCCTAAAACCCGCCACATCT-3′; ND1
reverse, 5′-GAGCGATGGTGAGAGCTAAGGT-3′; human globulin gene,
HGB-1 forward, 5′-GTGCACCTGACTCCTGAGGAGA-3′;
and HGB-2
reverse, 5′-CCTTGATACCAACCTGCCCAG-3′. Relative copy numbers
against pre-ﬂight means were estimated by the differences in the cycle
threshold values from the same volumes of puriﬁed DNA. Relative
quantiﬁcation values were plotted, and statistical analysis was per-
formed using the GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 software.
RNA sequencing
Each sequencing library preparation used 2.5 μl of puriﬁed RNA. For
the human plasma RNA and CD36-enriched RNA fractions, the SMART-
seq Stranded Kit (Takara Bio, cat. no. 634443) was used at a half-
volume scale following the user manual. The template amount was
veriﬁed before the second PCR step by performing real-time PCR with
the Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, cat. no.
4385612) on a 1 μl aliquot of library reaction in order to adjust the PCR
cycle for library ampliﬁcation. PCR products were puriﬁed and eluted
in 16 μl of Stranded Elution Buffer diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio.
Mouse plasma RNA sequencing using the NEBNext Small RNA Library
Kit (New England Biolabs, cat. no. E7330S) and 2 × 36 base paired-end
sequencing with NextSeq500 (Illumina) were performed as described
previously79.
Sequencing data analysis
Reads in FASTQ ﬁles were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench
(CLC-GW, ver.10.1.1, Qiagen), mapped to human (hg19) or mouse
(mm10) reference genomes, and quantiﬁed using a 57,773-gene
(human) or 49,585-gene (mouse) annotation set (downloaded from the
CLC-GW server) to obtain the total count values, which were combined
into a table. To plot normalized expression values, total counts were
normalized by the scaling option in CLC-GW (normalization value =
mean, reference = median mean, trimming 5%). Normalized total count
values were log-2 transformed after adding a pseudocount of unity.
ANOVAs and Empirical analyses of DRRs as described in ﬁgure legends
were performed in CLC-GW.
DNA sequencing
DNA was puriﬁed from input plasma and the CD36 fraction was soni-
cated with Bioruptor II (Sonic Bio) on the high setting for 10 min and
converted to sequencing libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA
Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, cat no. E7645) at half-scale.
Library products with insert sizes smaller than ~500 bp were selected
using AMPureXPbeads (Backman Coulter, cat. no.A63882). According
to our examination, the majority of mtDNA were included in high-
molecular-weight (>500 bp insert size) fractions in both total plasma
cfDNA and DNA puriﬁed from the CD36 fraction. 2 × 36 base paired-
end sequencing was performed, and FASTQ ﬁles were imported and
mapped to the hg19 human reference genome by CLC-GW.
Visualization of mapped RNA-seq and DNA-seq reads
All the mapped RNA-seq reads for each sample were combined into
pre-, in-, and post-ﬂight groups. Due to variations in the data quantity
and sample numbers in each phase, we decided to use all the reads for
visualization. Mapped RNA-seq and DNA-seq reads were exported
from CLC-GW as BAM format ﬁles, converted into bedGraph format
ﬁles, and the sections corresponding to the mitochondrial genome
were then selected and uploaded to the UCSC Genome Browser
(https://genome.ucsc.edu/).
Correlation analysis
Normalized quantiﬁcation values of bulk cfRNA-seq for 466 genes
from 64 samples (six astronauts, 11 time points, two samples removed)
were imported to GraphPad Prism 9.3.1. A Pearson correlation matrix
was created, and results were imported into Morpheus to draw a
heatmap. Gene annotations for pathways and tissue terms were
obtained from the Metascape output, including all genes in each
summary category.
Antibody screening and immunopuriﬁcation of plasma fraction
An antibody panel of 361 surface markers (LEGENDScreen Human
PE Kit, BioLegend, cat. no. 700007, lot no. B328253) was used. Each
antibody was reconstituted by adding 25 μl of water. For screening,
1 μl of each antibody was pooled. For the ﬁrst round, 48 wells from
rows A to H of four plates were pooled. For the second round, col-
umns 1–6 and 8–12 of row G were combined into 6 pools. For the
third round, antibodies from columns 2 and 8 in row G from four
plates were used individually. For each round of screening, 120 μl of
plasma aliquot was diluted with 750 μl of PBS, and 100 μl of diluted
plasma was combined with pooled antibodies. The mixture was

rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. At this incubation step, the dilution of each
antibody was 1:100. For each immunopuriﬁcation, 20 μl of Dyna-
beads Protein G (Invitrogen, cat. no. 1004D) were washed twice with
PBS and resuspended in 30 μl of PBS with 1 μl of monoclonal goat
anti-mouse IgM (Abcam, cat. no. ab9167, lot no. GR125217-5) and
0.1 mg/ml of BSA (New England Biolabs, B9001S). Washed Protein G
beads were added to the plasma samples with antibodies and
incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. At this incubation step, the dilution of
the IgM antibody combined with Protein G beads was 1:130. After
binding, beads were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Then, 25 μl of
SDS–Lysis buffer, 25 μl of TE buffer, and 5 μl of pronase stock were
added to the beads and incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. Eluted DNA
was combined with 150 μl of TE. DNA was then puriﬁed following the
plasma DNA puriﬁcation protocol at half-scale. Antibody clone
information and plate layout are provided by the manufacturer at
https://www.biolegend.com/Files/Images/media_assets/pro_detail/
datasheets/700011_Hu_LEGENDScreen_Layouts.xlsx.
Puriﬁcation of CD36 plasma fraction and RNA extraction
The 120 μl plasma aliquot was centrifuged to remove cell debris. The
100 μl supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and combined
with 650 μl of PBS, and 125 μl of the result was kept as input. The rest of
the diluted plasma was combined with a diluted anti-CD36 antibody
(2 μl of antibody and 40 μl of PBS with 1 × BSA per puriﬁcation). The
mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, 20 μl of washed protein G
beads combined with the goat anti-IgM antibody was added and
rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was removed, and the beads
were washed twice. Next, 1 ml of 1 × TRIzol (diluted TRIzol-LS with H2O
at 3:1 for 1× concentration) was added to the washed beads. 850 μl of
TRIzol-LS was added to the input. RNA was puriﬁed following the
plasma RNA puriﬁcation protocol.
Pathway and tissue-speciﬁcity analysis
Metascape 3.5 (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html) analysis was
performed on ﬁltered gene lists using default settings. Mouse genes
were imported as mouse genes and analyzed as human genes. DAVID
2021 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp) analysis was performed using
default settings. Human gene expression proﬁles were obtained from
the GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org/home) with the ﬁle that con-
tains median gene-level transcript per million (TPM) by tissue
“GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_tpm.gct.gz”.
Genes that matched within the ﬁltered gene lists were selected for
clustering and visualization.
Plots, heatmaps, and visualization
PCA plots, scatterplots, and normalized value plots were produced
using the GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 software. Metascape and DAVID ana-
lysis output values and pathway terms were visualized using the bub-
ble plot option in GraphPad Prism 9.3.1. Heatmaps were created using
Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). Normal-
ized log-2 total count values for ﬁltered genes were exported from
CLC-GW to Morpheus in Excel format. Clustering trees were produced
using the One-minus Pearson option in the Morpheus clustering
software.
DisGeNET analysis
DisGeNET human disease term enrichment results were obtained from
Metascape. Lists of DRRs (human, pre-, in-, post-ﬂight), 215 DRRs
(mouse, AG vs. MG), and 162 DRRs (mouse, MG vs. GC) were uploaded
to the Metascape webtool and analyzed as human genes by default
settings. DisGeNET80 result ﬁles were downloaded, and human disease
terms were ﬁltered by LogP < −4. The Venn diagram in Fig. 4f was
produced using Venny 2.1 (https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/
index.html). Overlapping parts of the Venn diagram (total 79 terms)
were depicted in Fig. 4g using −LogP (circle size) and gene counts
(color) after sorting by overlap group and LogP values using the
bubble plot option in GraphPad Prism 9.3.1.
Data availability
The processed ﬁles for human RNA-seq data generated in this study
have been deposited in the GeneLab database under accession code
OSD-530. Mouse raw and processed RNA-seq data sets have been
deposited in the GeneLab database with accession code OSD-532 and
in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession code
GSE213808. Since astronauts who belong to space agencies are highly
identiﬁable persons, individual medical and ﬂight-related records were
retained by personal information managers and not released to the
researchers who performed sample processing and data analysis. RNA-
seq raw datasets, which contain genome sequence information, are
not publicly available according to the approved conditions of this
study. Data access requires ethics committee approvals for the addi-
tion of researchers to the study plan. MM is responsible for explaining
further details about the ethical circumstances and controlled access
for RNA-seq raw data in response to requests within 4 weeks.
