Abstract
While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor
and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its
oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states
of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel
(MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like
MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the
structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found
that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional
oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three
independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that
SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and C8E5 detergents. However, performing similar experiments on
SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization
resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional
detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore
they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo
assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein’s true functionally relevant oligomeric state.

Introduction
The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL serves as a
biological ‘‘emergency release valve,’’ allowing rapid loss of solutes
in response to a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of a bacterium’s
environment [1]. It is perhaps the best characterized mechan-
osensor [2], thus serving as a paradigm of how a membrane
protein can detect and respond to mechanical forces [3].
Ironically, something as simple as the stoichiometry of the MscL
complex has plagued the field with debate since its inception.
The original model for the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) stoichiom-
etry was a homo-hexameric organization, which was suggested by
crosslinking and the study of tandem subunits [4]. This model then
appeared to be supported by low-resolution two-dimensional
crystallization of EcoMscL [5]. But the subsequent elucidation of
the M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) by X-ray crystallography [6]
then suggested a pentameric organization, at least for this
orthologue. This result led to a re-evaluation of EcoMscL
stoichiometry [6,7], which supported a pentameric organization
and brought into question whether the two-dimensional crystal-
lization data could be fit by 5-fold as well as 6-fold symmetry.
Thus, the field transiently seemed to have settled that MscL was
most likely a pentamer. However, the recent crystallographic
structure of the S. aureus homolog (SaMscL) reveals a tetramer
variant [8]. This latter finding has again raised questions regarding
the true oligomeric state of MscL and evokes the possibilities either
that MscL from different species assemble into complexes with
different stoichiometries or that the channel exists as multiple
functional oligomeric complexes in the cell membrane. Therefore,
we set out to identify the MscL oligomeric state in the cell
membrane and to understand how the SaMscL channel, which
shares approximately 40% sequence identity with EcoMscL and
MtMscL [8], could exist in the non-pentameric subunit organi-
zation resolved by X-ray crystallography. We found not only that

the true in vivo oligomeric state of SaMscL is a pentamer but also
that at least one detergent, LDAO, artificially but reversibly
reorganizes this structure into a tetrameric stoichiometry.
Results
With multiple oligomeric states identified in vitro, we devised a
disulfide-trapping strategy to identify the oligomeric state of MscL
in bacterial membranes. Using this approach, we were able to
directly measure the subunit stoichiometry of SaMscL in vivo by
generating a series of double-cysteine mutants in regions predicted
to be in close proximity from both existing crystal structures
(Figure 1A). These modifications allow crosslinking in the cell
membrane via disulfide bonds as previously described [9,10].
Briefly, the cells were osmotically shocked in the presence of the
oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline, centrifuged, and then
immediately
resuspended
in
SDS
loading
buffer
to
avoid
unnecessary manipulation of the proteins. As we previously
observed [9], osmotic shock increased disulfide bridging, presum-
ably because reductants including glutathione and thioredoxin are
released from the cell [11], thus decreasing the reducing potential
of the cytosol. The protein content of the lysed cells was evaluated
using SDS-PAGE and molecular weight standards. For the L10C/
L89C or L10C/M91C SaMscL channels, we were able to observe
efficient in vivo disulfide trapping (Figure 1B). For the L10C/
Author Summary
The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not
only the senses of touch hearing and balance but also
cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. One of the primary
ways that organisms detect forces is through mechan-
osensitive channels, and mechanosensation is so vital that
essentially all organisms have at least one such sensor.
Indeed, the best-studied mechanosensitive channel is from
bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechan-
osensors from higher organisms, these channels are a
model for how a protein can sense and respond to
mechanical forces. Although the bacterial mechanosensi-
tive channel MscL has been well studied, the simple issue
of how many subunits it has is hotly debated. There are
even two published crystal structures showing either
tetrameric or pentameric complexes. Here we show that
the channel is actually pentameric in vivo and that the
detergent used to solubilize the protein can rearrange the
complexes from pentamers to tetramers. The finding that
detergents can have such a profound effect on structure
may have broad implications for the study of other
membrane proteins.

L89C protein, a range of oligomeric states was observed, a
pentamer being the maximal state. However, for the L10C/M91C
protein, one primary band was observed that reflects a pentameric
complex. These data demonstrate that the pentamer is by far the
major species within the cell membrane and thus appears to be the
true structural and functional unit in vivo.
With SaMscL pentamers being the predominant oligomeric state
in the cell membrane, we wanted to understand why SaMscL
crystallized as a tetramer. We began by confirming the previously
observed pentameric and tetrameric states of MscL by performing
crosslinking experiments of purified EcoMscL and SaMscL,
visualizing
their
oligomeric
state
by
Western
blot
analysis
(Figure 2). Five crosslinked EcoMscL products were observed,
consistent with previous reports showing that EcoMscL is a
pentamer [6,7]. In contrast with previous findings [8], SaMscL also
presented five crosslinked products, suggesting that SaMscL also
exists in a pentameric oligomeric state. No difference was observed
between proteins expressed by a high-expressing plasmid (pET) and
those encoded a moderate-expressing plasmid (pB10), demonstrating
that expressions levels have no effect on MscL oligomerization. To
substantiate these results, sedimentation equilibrium analytical
ultracentrifugation (SE) was performed to directly measure the mass
of the SaMscL channel. The results for SaMscL were fit to a single-
species model and yielded a molar mass of 71.2 kDa, consistent with
a pentameric subunit organization (SaMscL theoretical pentameric
molar mass is 72.2 kDa) (Figure 3A, B). As a third independent
method to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel, we
performed size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scatter-
ing (SEC-MALS) experiments [12]. Analysis of nine independent
SEC-MALS experiments resulted in an average calculated SaMscL
mass of 72.860.8 kDa (Ave 6 SD, n = 9), again consistent with a
pentameric subunit organization of SaMscL (representative exper-
iment shown in Figure 3C).
The data presented in Figures 2 and 3 show three independent
approaches that all confirm the pentameric oligomeric state of
SaMscL, in agreement with our in vivo crosslinking results. These
data are also consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure [6,13]
and biochemical studies of EcoMscL [7] but inconsistent with the
subunit organization in the SaMscL crystal structure [8]. The major
difference in the protein handling between our experiments and
those previously published for the SaMscL channel [8] was the
choice of solubilizing detergent. Our measurements were made in
the presence of either Triton X-100 (crosslinking) or pentaethylene
glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergent (SE and SEC-MALS), not
Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO), the detergent used previously
to crystallize SaMscL and evaluate its oligomeric state [8]. To
determine if the solubilizing detergent could account for the
discrepancies in the data, we tested whether LDAO may affect the
oligomeric state of SaMscL.
We performed SaMscL crosslinking experiments in the presence
of LDAO and found essentially no crosslinked pentamer and a
substantial increase in tetramers when compared to the experi-
ments performed in Triton X-100 (Figure 4A). To confirm that
LDAO was altering the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel
rather than simply affecting our crosslinking efficiency, we directly
measured the mass of the SaMscL protein in the presence of
LDAO by SEC-MALS (representative experiment shown in
Figure 4B). The results show that the average protein mass in
the presence of LDAO is 60.062.8 kDa (Ave 6 SD, n = 8), a mass
that is dramatically reduced compared to the C8E5 experiments
(72.860.8 kDa) and that is consistent with a tetrameric oligomeric
state (theoretical SaMscL tetramer is 57.8 kDa). As a third
independent approach to assess the oligomeric state of the protein,
we performed sedimentation velocity experiments on the SaMscL
protein in LDAO. Two different methods were used to calculate
the molar mass of the protein from these data (see Methods for
details). Both resulted in similar values: 62.361.3 kDa (‘‘s and D’’
method, Figure 4C) and 6463 kDa (‘‘Stokes radius’’ method)
(Weighted Ave 6 1s). These results again show a protein molar
mass well below that of a pentamer, consistent with LDAO
affecting the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel.
We also tested the reversibility of this oligomeric state
reorganization by using SaMscL purified in LDAO and then
exchanged the LDAO detergent for C8E5. This protocol resulted
in the SaMscL mass increasing from 61.460.7 kDa (Ave 6 SD,
n = 3) to 72.062.6 kDa (Ave 6 SD, n = 4) as measured by SEC-
MALS (Figure 5). The choice of initial detergent made no
difference in the reversibility, as purifying SaMscL in C8E5 and
then exchanging the detergent for LDAO showed a mass decrease
from 72.260.5 kDa in C8E5 (Ave 6 SD, n = 5) to 58.760.7 kDa
in LDAO (Ave 6 SD, n = 3). Hence, the oligomeric rearrange-
ment is reversible and is completely dependent upon the detergent
solubilizing the MscL protein.
Discussion
Essentially all previous structural studies on MscL, as with most
membrane proteins, have been performed on channels that have
been solubilized, under the assumption that detergents do not alter
the subunit stoichiometry. Our data examining the effect of
different detergents on the oligomeric state of SaMscL have far-
reaching implications for membrane protein research, as we now
clearly demonstrate that changes in oligomeric state can and do
occur upon detergent solubilization, and these alterations are not
easily detected by SEC (see Figures 3C and 4B). To circumvent
these artifacts associated with solubilization, we have developed an
in vivo cross-linking assay. Although the pentamer is by far the

location of monomers (16) to pentamers (56) is shown between the

major product observed in Figure 1B, very small amounts of
smaller oligomers can be resolved upon overloading of protein gels
and long Western blot exposures. The small amount of tetramers
and smaller complexes observed upon long exposure could be
incompletely assembled protein or may simply be due to the lack
of disulfide bridging, which is rarely observed to be this efficient
(e.g. see [9,10]). In addition, we cannot completely rule out the
possibility that oligomerization is a dynamic and even reversible
process in vivo. Regardless, it seems unlikely that oligomeric
species smaller than pentamers have a physiological role given that
there are tens of channels per cell [14], and the smaller species
compose only a few percent of the total channels. Our data
definitively show that the vast majority of the SaMscL channel
adopts a pentameric structure in the cell membrane, consistent
with the MtMscL crystal structure [6], but incompatible with the
SaMscL crystal structure [8].

A close inspection of the recent tetrameric SaMscL structure,
which was speculated to be in an expanded gating intermediate
state, reveals structural interactions between residues in TM1 and
TM2 residues of a neighboring subunit similar to those in the
closed MtMscL structure. This result was surprising because
several studies using various techniques have suggested TM1
undergoes a significant clockwise rotation (as viewed from the
periplasmic side) upon channel gating. The approaches supporting
this interpretation include: spin labeling combined with electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies [15], accessibility of
sulfhydryl reagents to cysteine mutants in TM1 upon gating
[16,17], accessibility of heavy metals to engineered binding sites in
the pore [18], suppression mutagenesis demonstrating interactions
between TM1 and TM2 upon gating [19], and confirmation of
multiple interaction sites between TM1 and TM2 upon gating by
using an electrostatic repulsion approach as well as disulfide
trapping [10]. Both the EPR studies as well as the heavy-metal
binding in the pore strongly suggest that this rotation occurs quite
early in the gating process, before ion permeation. By this model,
V21 and G24 (V23 and G26 in EcoMscL) should rotate away
Figure 5. The S. aureus MscL stoichiometry change is reversible. (A) The oligomeric state of SaMscL in 4 mM LDAO was determined using
SEC-MALS, which measured a protein mass of 61.3 kDa, consistent with a tetrameric channel (top chromatogram). (B) The SaMscL-LDAO sample was
exchanged into C8E5, and the following day the oligomeric state of SaMscL-C8E5 sample was measured by SEC-MALS. Analysis of the SEC-MALS
results for the SaMscL-C8E5 sample showed a protein mass of 74.4 kDa, consistent with the channel in a pentameric state.

from the pore constriction, allowing V22 and the positively
charged K29 (I24 and K31 in EcoMscL) to line the open pore.
The observation that this rearrangement has not occurred strongly
suggests that the crystal SaMscL structure actually reflects a
strained closed state due to improper oligomeriazation, rather than
an expanded intermediate state.
The observed stoichiometry changes in detergents also evoke
questions regarding how membrane protein subunits assemble into
physiological
multimeric
complexes.
A
previous
report
on
EcoMscL demonstrated that when the protein is translated in
vitro in the absence of any lipid or detergent and is subsequently
purified in the presence of Triton X-100, the channel spontane-
ously assembles into pentamers [20]. A separate study demon-
strated that even synthetically synthesized EcoMscL will oligomer-
ize
into
functional
channels
when
incorporated
into
lipid
membranes [21]. These studies demonstrate that the EcoMscL
channel has the ability to self-assemble into the functional
oligomer in vitro. Similarly, it appears that C8E5 and Triton
X-100 allow SaMscL to properly fold and assemble into a
pentameric structure, which correlates with the observed oligo-
meric state in vivo. In contrast, LDAO reorganizes SaMscL into
tetramers that do not appear to exist in significant quantities in
vivo, suggesting that they are not physiologically relevant. The
observed self-assembly properties of EcoMscL under many
conditions, combined with the reversible nature of the detergent-
induced oligomeric state changes for SaMscL, may explain why
Liu et al. observed channel function for the LDAO solubilized
SaMscL tetramers [8]; presumably, once the tetrameric LDAO-
solubilized SaMscL is reconstituted into lipids, it rearranges back
into functional pentameric structures.
The crystal structure of the SaMscL was derived from a
truncation mutant in which several amino acids at the C-terminus
had been removed [8]. One previous study suggested that at least
some C-terminus deletions of EcoMscL could lead to the formation
of larger aggregates when translated in a cell-free system [22]. While
we cannot rule out the possibility that the SaMscL deletion
contributed to the stabilization of the tetramer in the crystal, our
data do demonstrate that detergents alone can stabilize alternative
oligomeric states of the full-length SaMscL in solution.
Our observations make it tempting to speculate that larger,
more hydrated head groups (i.e. the head groups of C8E5 and
Triton X-100) promote pentamer formation, while smaller head
groups (i.e. LDAO) promote tetramer formation. However, with
such a small number of detergents tested thus far, additional
experiments will be required to identify what chemical properties
of the detergents cause the oligomeric state change and what
effect, if any, lipids may have on the stabilization of specific
oligomeric states.
In sum, our data demonstrate that the physiologically active
SaMscL oligomer in vivo is a pentamer and that purification in
detergents can cause a reorganization of the SaMscL channel’s
oligomeric state. Our findings also show that SEC alone is
insufficient to evaluate the usefulness of a particular detergent for
the study of membrane proteins; ideally, SEC-MALS and/or
analytical ultracentrifugation should be correlated with in vivo
experiments that can more confidently determine the functional and
physiologically relevant oligomeric state of membrane proteins.
Materials and Methods
Purification
SaMscL (accession number: CAG43065) was expressed using the
pET21a vector in PB116 E. coli cells grown to O.D.600 0.6–0.8 and
induced with 1 mM IPTG for 2–3 h at 37uC. Cells were harvested
and stored at 280uC until needed. Cells containing SaMscL were
lysed in 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml DNAse,
1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 150 ml protease inhibitors (Sigma) using a
French press at 16K PSI at 4uC. The cell lysate was incubated with
40 mM n-Decyl-b-D-Maltopyranoside (DM) for 1 h at 4uC and
then centrifuged at 24,0006g for 30 min at 4uC to clarify the lysate.
4 mM imidazol was added to the resulting supernatant and then
bound to 4 ml of Ni-NTA slury pre-equilibrated with 50 mM NaPi
pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazol, and 40 mM DM for 1 h
at 4uC. Standard metal affinity chromatography was performed
with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mM NaPi
pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazol, 4 mM DM, and SaMscL
was eluted with 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM
imidazol, and 4 mM DM. The purest protein fractions were
combined and concentrated using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff
filter (Amicon). Detergent exchange was accomplished by adding
40 mM Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO) or 5% (w/v) pen-
taethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) to the concentrated
SaMscL and allowing the protein-detergent complex to equilibrate
overnight at room temperature. The following day the protein was
subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a superdex 200
column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl,
and 4 mM LDAO or 0.5% (w/v) C8E5. The eluting peak was
collected and concentrated using a 50,000 molecular weight cutoff
filter (Amicon) and used for either sedimentation equilibrium
experiments or size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light
scattering experiments (SEC-MALS).
Crosslinking
SaMscL and EcoMscL were cloned into pB10 and pET21a
vectors and transformed into PB104 or PB116 E. coli and purified
as previously described [10]. 2% Triton X-100 or 44 mM LDAO
was used for MscL extraction with a final concentration of 0.2%
and 2.1 mM, respectively, after purification. For crosslinking
reactions 5 mg of protein was incubated with 2 mM DSS (Thermo
Scientific) on ice for 5 min. The reaction was quenched with a
final concentration of 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 for 15 min at room
temperature as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were
brought up in non-reducing sample buffer, were loaded on a
Criterion 4–20% gel, and were subjected to Western as previously
described [10]. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was
used at 1:4,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-
Rad) at 1:100,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate
(Millipore) and exposed to film.
In Vivo Disulfide Trapping
Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown 1 h at 37uC in
LB. LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of
0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when
an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked
(0.5 M
NaCl
LB)
or
shocked
(water
with
1.5 mM
copper
phenanthroline) at a 1:20 dilution for 15 min at 37uC. Samples
were spun down at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately re-
suspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and
run on a 4%–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis [10]. The
primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at 1:4,000 and
the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad) at 1:40,000. Blots
were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film.

were
calibrated
following the manufacturer’s guidelines, and 40 ml of running
buffer (20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl and 4 mM LDAO or
0.5% (w/v) C8E5) was used to equilibrate the SEC column and
establish stable baselines for the light scattering and refractive index
instruments. 25–75 mg of purified protein was used for each SEC-
MALS experiment, and data were collected using ASTRA V
software
(Wyatt
Technologies)
and
processed
following
the
manufacturer’s guidelines. LDAO and C8E5 dn/dc values (0.1490
and 0.1240, respectively) were measured using the Optilab rEX
following the manufacturer’s guidelines and the SaMscL extinction
coefficient was calculated from the amino acid sequence.
Analytical Ultracentrifugation
Buffer density-matching experiments were performed in a
Beckman Coulter XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge to identify the
appropriate solution density to match the density of the C8E5
detergent. Volumes of 180 mL of solutions containing 20 mM NaPi
pH 7.5, 0.5% (w/v) C8E5, and various concentrations of NaCl were
placed in the sample sector of a dual-sectored, charcoal-filled Epon
centerpiece (Beckman-Coulter; all AUC experiments were carried
out in such centerpieces) that was sandwiched between sapphire
windows. Identical buffers without detergent were placed in the
reference sector. The centrifugation cells were centrifuged at a
temperature of 25uC and a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm; an An-50Ti
rotor was used for all centrifugation experiments. The formation of
any
detergent
concentration
gradient
was
monitored
using
interference optics. C8E5 was found to be neutrally buoyant in
20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl, which was then used for all
sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments with 0.5%
C8E5 at 25uC. 4, 8, 40, and 80 mM SaMscL samples were prepared
and loaded into the assembled ultracentrifuge cells; buffer with
detergent was deposited in the reference sector. Long solution
columns (180 mL) were also used in this experiment. Centrifugation
was performed at 25uC at 9,500, 14,000, and 17,500 rpm. The data
were analyzed using SEDFIT to determine if the samples had come
to equilibrium, and SEDPHAT [23] was used to fit the
sedimentation
equilibrium
data
to
a
single
species
model.
Multispeed analysis with mass-conservation constraints was per-
formed, allowing the time-invariant and radially invariant noise
elements to be calculated and subtracted from the data [23]. A
68.3% confidence interval was calculated as previously described
[24,25]. The error number reported is the average of the positive
and negative deviations from best mass value. For the determination
of the amount of detergent bound per gram of protein (dD), buffer
without detergent was used in the reference sector, and two different
concentrations (41 and 66 mM) of MscL were placed in the sample
sector. The volume of each sample and reference was 390 ml. The
rotor speed used was 50,000 rpm, and the temperature setting was
20uC. The data were analyzed in SEDFIT using the non-interacting
discrete species model [26,27]. The flotation of the detergent
micelles (the density of LDAO is less than that of water) was
explicitly
accounted
for
by
giving
that
species
a
negative
sedimentation coefficient. The amounts of absorbance units and
interference fringes present for the main sedimenting species were
derived from this analysis. Using the calculated extinction
coefficient of the protein and the known refractive index increments
of the detergent and the protein, dD was calculated as in le Maire et
al. [28]. Subsequent sedimentation velocity experiments were
performed with 20, 32, and 64 mM SaMscL samples in 4 mM
LDAO at 50,000 rpm at 20uC. The volume centrifuged was
390 mL. In these cases, the reference buffer contained the same
[LDAO] as the sample. The absorbance data (interference data
were not collected) were initially analyzed using the c(s) model in
SEDFIT [26]. Although LDAO has a very low extinction coefficient
at 280 nm, its floatation was detectable; the range of data near to
the meniscus was therefore eliminated for this analysis. In these
analyses, small quantities (2%–3% of the total signal) of large species
were detected. Using this information, all species, including the
floating detergent, were modeled in the ‘‘species analysis’’ model in
SEDPHAT [26]. This approach is referred to as the ‘‘s and D’’
method in the text, because both the sedimentation coefficient and
the diffusion coefficient are refined to arrive at the buoyant molar
mass (Mb). Mb was transformed to M (the molar mass of the protein)
using the formula

[29]
The symbol r is the solution density, vP is the partial specific
volume of the protein, and vD is the partial specific volume of the
detergent. Any lipids bound to SaMscL were neglected in these
calculations. Mb was also calculated using the relationship
Mb~6pN0gRss,
ð3Þ
where N0 is Avogadro’s number, g is the solution viscosity, Rs is the
Stokes radius of the protein/detergent complex, and s is the
sedimentation coefficient. The Stokes radius of the protein was
obtained by calibrating the SEC column described above with
proteins of known Stokes radius. Rs for SaMscL in LDAO was
4.2 nm. Again, Mb was transformed to M using Eq. 1. Values for
vP, g, and r were estimated using the program SEDNTERP [30].
The value of vD was taken as 1.13 mL/g [31]. Confidence
intervals of s and Mb were calculated as detailed above. A
confidence interval for the value of Stokes radius, which was
derived from a linear regression, was:
Rs+ta=2ss

where t is the t statistic, ss is the estimate of s for the regression line,
Ve is the elution volume of MscL from the SEC column, Ve is the
average elution volume of the standards, n is the number of
standards, and SVV is the sum of squared deviations of the
individual standard compared to Ve. In cases of asymmetric error
intervals, the s was taken as the average of the difference between
the boundary value and the best-fitted value. Because multiple
experiments, each having different errors, were performed, the
value of M reported in the main text is the weighted mean mw 6
