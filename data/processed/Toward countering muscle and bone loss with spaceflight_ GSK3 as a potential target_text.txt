SUMMARY
We examined the effects of 30 days of spaceﬂight on glycogen synthase kinase 3
(GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone
samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and
RR18). Spaceﬂight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine
phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b
was linked to the reduction in type IIA ﬁbers commonly observed with spaceﬂight
as these ﬁbers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of
inhibiting GSK3 before this ﬁber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-spe-
ciﬁc Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and pro-
moted the oxidative ﬁber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone,
GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceﬂight; and strikingly, muscle-speciﬁc
Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading.
Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceﬂight.
INTRODUCTION
From the ﬁrst manned ﬂight into space to sending humans to the surface of the moon, we have gained a
better appreciation and understanding of the complexities of space travel. Now in the 21st century, current
efforts are aimed at a return to the moon, largely in part as preparation for longer duration missions that
take humans to Mars for the ﬁrst time. However, as space exploration advances into new environmental
domains, the complications with basic human survival and physiology become even more evident.
NASA has identiﬁed several hazards of human spaceﬂight including space radiation, isolation and conﬁne-
ment, distance from earth (and its technological hurdles), exposure to extreme temperatures, pressures,
and microgravity.1 As humans and other mammals have evolved with Earth’s natural gravity, exposure to
microgravity with spaceﬂight can lead to many maladaptive changes, one in particular being a decline in
musculoskeletal health and function. The absence of gravity unloads muscles and bones, leading to a
reduction in size and strength - akin to aging on Earth. As a result, Space Agencies across the world
have focused their attention on developing mitigation strategies to protect musculoskeletal health during
space travel, not only to preserve astronaut health and the mission at hand, but also in hopes of developing
novel and innovative strategies that may counter aging on Earth.
GSK3 is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase that has two
known isoforms: GSK3a and GSK3b, with the latter being dominant in most tissues. It is a constitutively active
enzyme, indicating that it has high protein kinase activity under resting conditions, though it can be inhibited
through Ser phosphorylation (Ser21, GSK3a; and Ser9, GSK3b).2 As both isoforms are structurally similar (95%
sequenceidentityintheircatalyticdomains3),itisnotsurprisingthattheyalsosharesomefunctionalredundancy,
though unique and tissue-speciﬁc roles have also been demonstrated.4–8 In general, GSK3 is thought to act as a
‘‘brake’’ in many anabolic pathways, including the Wnt/b-catenin and insulin signaling pathways.2 In the context
of the musculoskeletal system, GSK3 is a well-known negative regulator of both muscle9–13 and bone
mass2,10,14,15 that not only slows the anabolic pathways but in many cases can also accelerate the catabolic ones.
With its involvement in the regulation of both bone and muscle mass, it is possible that targeting GSK3
could represent a viable mitigation strategy against the musculoskeletal declines seen with spaceﬂight.

Several lines of evidence found here on Earth are in support of this. We have shown that inhibiting GSK3
with lithium can increase myoblast fusion and differentiation10 and promote osteogenic signaling in bones
from mice.10 Furthermore, patients being treated with lithium for bipolar disorder have been previously
shown to have signiﬁcantly reduced risk of fracture.16 In addition, an impressive body of work from Dr. Boris
Shenkman’s laboratory has shown that GSK3 is more active in muscles after hindlimb suspension (HLS) – a
well-accepted simulated microgravity model – and that its inhibition can attenuate the consequential mus-
cle remodeling (for review readers are referred to ref. 17). Although the evidence from ground-based
models suggests that GSK3 may be a viable target against the musculoskeletal decline observed with
spaceﬂight, to our knowledge, there are no studies to date that have investigated this possibility in space.
Moreover, the effects of spaceﬂight, if any, on muscle and bone GSK3 content/signaling remains unknown.
This could be an initial ﬁrst step in ﬁrmly establishing GSK3 inhibition as a potential countermeasure.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of spaceﬂight on murine muscle and bone GSK3
content and activation status. We obtained samples from various missions/payloads where male or female
mice were exposed to microgravity for 30–37 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) or the BION-
M1 biosatellite. In addition to this, we characterized the effects of dual muscle-speciﬁc GSK3a/b knock-
down on muscle size and strength as well as region-speciﬁc (tibia, femur, lumbar spine) bone mineral
density (BMD) in response to simulated microgravity via HLS. In doing so, we provide evidence in support
of targeting GSK3 to enhance bone and muscle health during spaceﬂight.
RESULTS
GSK3b content is reduced in muscles from spacefaring mice
Soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle samples from the ﬂight (F), ground
control (GC), and vivarium control (VIV) groups were obtained from the BION-M1 mission as well as the ro-
dent research 1 (RR1), RR9, and RR18 (BuOE and saline-treated) missions through the NASA Life Sciences
Data Archive Institutional Scientiﬁc Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. Absolute muscle mass data
for the RR9 (soleus and TA) and RR1 (soleus) missions were reported in a recent study published by our
group showing signiﬁcant muscle atrophy.18 Muscle mass data for the BION-M1 (soleus and EDL) mission
were also reported previously where although both soleus and EDL muscles appeared to be smaller in the F
group, there were no signiﬁcant differences when compared with GC or VIV.19 Muscle mass data for RR18
are reported here in Table S1.
We ﬁrst characterized the effects of spaceﬂight on GSK3 content and activation, and although there was no
effect of spaceﬂight in the EDL or TA, we found signiﬁcant differences in the soleus - a postural muscle that
is most affected by microgravity exposure (Figures S1–S7). To summarize the soleus data, we examined the
fold-change response in the F group relative to the combined average of the GC and VIV control groups, as
no differences were detected between the GC and VIV groups (Figure 1). Across all missions, we observed
signiﬁcant reductions in total GSK3b content (-22-54%) compared with GCVIV control with a combined
reduction of 36% (Figure 1A). When examining the overall effect of spaceﬂight on Ser9 phosphorylated
GSK3b content, we found a combined 1.2-fold increase in phosphorylation, however, this was only
statistically signiﬁcant for the BION-M1 and RR18 saline cohorts. Unlike GSK3b content, we did not ﬁnd
a consistent reduction in GSK3a across all missions (Figure 1C). Similarly, we found no combined effect
of spaceﬂight on Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK3a (Figure 1D). Altogether, these ﬁndings suggest that
spaceﬂight more prominently affects the GSK3b isoform by reducing its protein levels and, though not
consistent for all missions, by also increasing its Ser9 phosphorylation.
To help explain why GSK3b was lower in soleus muscles after spaceﬂight, we followed up on our previous
ﬁndings showing that the fast-twitch EDL muscle has lower GSK3b content compared with the slow-twitch
soleus.13 We posited that the reduction in GSK3b found with spaceﬂight would be largely attributed to the
slow-to-fast ﬁber type shift that occurs within the murine soleus.19–22 Across all missions analyzed, there
were signs of a slow-to-fast ﬁber type shift in the soleus after spaceﬂight with an average 30% and 61%
reduction in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIa, respectively (Figures 1E, 1F, S8, and S9). Conversely,
we found an average 4-fold and 2.9-fold increase in MHC IIx and IIb isoforms, respectively, in the soleus
after spaceﬂight (Figures 1G, 1H, S8, and S9). The reduction in type IIa is of particular interest as our immu-
noﬂuorescent microscopy experiments indicate that in the soleus and EDL muscles from otherwise healthy
mice (e.g., mobile control), GSK3b is most abundant in the type IIA ﬁbers that are identiﬁed with MHC IIa

(Figure 2). Thus, the reduction in type IIA ﬁbers found with spaceﬂight likely accounts for the reduction in
GSK3b protein observed with spaceﬂight.
Muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 knockdown increases soleus muscle size and strength under simulated
microgravity conditions
The reduction in GSK3b observed after spaceﬂight in the murine soleus could suggest that GSK3 has only a
minimal role in the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness. However, given that our analyses of GSK3 con-
tent was conducted in muscle samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceﬂight, we next wanted to
determine the effects of GSK3 inhibition before microgravity-induced muscle unloading, and more impor-
tantly, before any change in ﬁber type distribution that would result in lowered GSK3b content. To this end,
we employed the NASA developed HLS model to simulate microgravity exposure on Earth. To inhibit
GSK3, we used a muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 knockdown (GSK3mKD) mouse model previously generated in our
lab.23 These mice display partial knockdown (-40-50%) of both GSK3 isoforms in the soleus (Figure S10).
In turn, these mice have signiﬁcantly larger soleus muscles - both in absolute and relative to body mass
terms (Figure S10). Furthermore, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans show that these mice have lowered
body fat % and increased lean mass % (Figure S10).
After 7 days of HLS, GSK3mKD mice still had lowered % fat mass, elevated % lean mass, and increased sol-
eus:body mass ratio when compared with GSK3ﬂox mice (Figures 3A–3E). However, although GSK3mKD
mice had larger soleus muscles after HLS (Figure 3), normalizing the data to mobile controls demonstrated
that muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 knockdown did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS as
both GSK3mKD and GSK3ﬂox mice experienced a 50–60% reduction in absolute soleus mass and a 40–
50% reduction in normalized soleus mass (Figures 3F and 3G). Nonetheless, soleus muscles from GSK3mKD
HLS mice were still larger when compared to GSK3ﬂox HLS mice, which was further supported by H&E anal-
ysis and a rightward shift in ﬁber cross-sectional area (CSA) distribution (Figures 3H and 3I). Upon closer
inspection, we also found that the GSK3mKD HLS mice had a greater proportion of ﬁbers with centrally
located nuclei (Figure 3J), which is indicative of enhanced myogenic repair. Corroborating these ﬁndings,
myogenic markers Pax7 and myogenin were signiﬁcantly greater in HLS soleus muscles from GSK3mKD mice
versus GSK3ﬂox mice (Figure 3K). Furthermore, we found that soleus muscles from GSK3mKD HLS mice also
had greater MHC IIa, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1a),
and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) protein levels versus GSK3mKD HLS mice (Figure 3L). With
a signiﬁcant reduction in MHC IIx (Figure 3L), these results provide evidence for an oxidative ﬁber type shift
with muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 knockdown, which is consistent with our previous ﬁndings in mice treated with
various pharmacological GSK3 inhibitors.24,25 In terms of soleus muscle strength, we found that after
HLS, GSK3mKD mice displayed greater force production across submaximal and maximal frequencies (Fig-
ure 3M). This effect was not found in a mobile state (Figure 3N), and therefore, calculating the percent
reduction in speciﬁc force (HLS mice relative to their respective mobile controls), we found that soleus
muscles from GSK3mKD mice had signiﬁcantly greater preservation (e.g. lower % reduction) of force across
submaximal and maximal stimulation frequencies (Figure 3O). Altogether, these results show that targeted
GSK3 inhibition before muscle unloading can increase soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and the
oxidative ﬁber type while also preserving muscle strength.
Characterizing GSK3 activation in bones after spaceﬂight and the effects of muscle-speciﬁc
GSK3 knockdown on femur, tibia, and lumbar bone mineral density
We then investigated the effects of microgravity exposure on GSK3b content and phosphorylation in femur
bones obtained from the RR9 mission. As expected, DXA scan analysis of the femurs showed signiﬁcantly

reduced bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the F group compared with the
combined GCVIV control (Figures 4A and 4B). Additional micro-computed tomography (mCT) analysis of
the tibia from these same mice demonstrated decrements in bone structure were apparent in the cortical
bone outcomes, whereas no differences in trabecular bone outcomes were evident (Table S2). Speciﬁcally,
ﬂight mice presented lower cortical area fraction and periosteal perimeter, which was aligned with lower
cortical thickness, compared to GCVIV control mice. Western blot analysis revealed a signiﬁcant reduction
in the pGSK3b in the femur compared with GCVIV with no changes in total GSK3b content (Figures 4C–4E).
This in turn led to a reduction in the phosphorylation status of GSK3b, and though it did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance (Figure 4F), it is perhaps indicative of greater GSK3b activation in murine bones after
spaceﬂight.
Using the DXA scans from the GSK3mKD and GSK3ﬂox mobile and HLS mice, we then performed bone-spe-
ciﬁc regional BMD analysis on the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine to determine whether muscle-speciﬁc
Gsk3 knockdown could provide positive effects on BMD crosstalk (Figure 4H). In the mobile state, we
did not ﬁnd any differences in region-speciﬁc BMD between GSK3mKD and GSK3ﬂox mice (Figures 4G
and 4H). However, after 7 days of HLS, we found that tibia BMD was greater in GSK3mKD HLS mice versus
GSK3ﬂox HLS mice (Figure 4I). A similar result was found in the lumbar spine; albeit, this was not statistically
signiﬁcant (Figure 4I). In terms of tissue crosstalk, we examined the effects of muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 knock-
down on soleus muscle ﬁbronectin type III domain-containing protein (FNDC5), which is the precursor for
the myokine irisin that gets secreted out into circulation with exercise and activation of PGC-1a in muscle.26
Irisin produced and secreted from muscle can promote bone strength and mass in mice; and has been
shown to limit bone loss associated with HLS.27,28 Here, we demonstrate that the increase in region-speciﬁc
BMD found with GSK3mKD was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in FNDC5 in the soleus (Figure 4J).
Though our study is limited in that we did not collect serum to measure irisin levels, we think it is possible
that muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 knockdown could positively impact BMD (particularly in the tibia and lumbar
spine) by increasing PGC-1a and FNDC5 in muscle (Figure 4K).
DISCUSSION
Here, we questioned whether GSK3 would be a viable therapeutic target that when inhibited could prevent
or limit the muscle and bone loss associated with spaceﬂight. To this end, we ﬁrst examined the effects of at
least 30 days of spaceﬂight on GSK3 content and activation status in murine muscle and bone samples. We
then supplemented this work with Earth-based HLS experiments in GSK3mKD mice where we assessed mus-
cle size and strength with region-speciﬁc BMD.
In the postural soleus muscle, we found that GSK3b but not GSK3a was consistently and signiﬁcantly
reduced in the F group compared with GCVIV, which is in line with previous proteomics analysis from
the BION-M1 mission (see Tables S1 and S4 from ref. 19) and indicates that the two isoforms may be differ-
entially regulated during spaceﬂight. Indeed, these GSK3 isoforms are encoded by separate genes located

on two different chromosomes (Gsk3a, mouse chromosome 7; and Gsk3b, mouse chromosome 18).
Furthermore, inhibitory Ser phosphorylation was only enhanced with the GSK3b isoform after spaceﬂight;
albeit not consistently across all missions, whereas Ser phosphorylation of GSK3a was virtually unaltered,
which again indicates the two GSK3 isoforms are differentially regulated with spaceﬂight.
Although the observed reduction in GSK3b content and its increase in inhibitory Ser9 phosphorylation in
the soleus may argue against its involvement in the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness found with mus-
cle unloading and spaceﬂight, it may just reﬂect the slow-to-fast ﬁber type shift, namely a reduction in type
IIA ﬁbers which we have shown are particularly enriched with GSK3b. This is consistent with our previous
ﬁndings showing that GSK3b is highly expressed in the soleus versus the EDL29 as the soleus comprises
nearly 50% IIA ﬁbers versus the EDL, which only comprises 10% type IIA ﬁbers.30 Moreover, we previously
found greater Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3b in the EDL versus the soleus.29 Alternatively, or perhaps
congruently, it is also possible that these changes in GSK3b content and activation may point toward an
adaptive/compensatory response aimed at limiting GSK3 activation to limit muscle atrophy and weakness.
Providing additional GSK3 inhibition, preferably before the onset of muscle unloading and the ensuing ﬁ-
ber type changes may then preserve muscle health and function during spaceﬂight.
To establish whether GSK3 inhibition could potentially preserve muscle size and strength in response to
microgravity exposure, we utilized the simulated microgravity HLS model. Our results show that muscle-
speciﬁc genetic reduction before muscle unloading and the ensuing ﬁber type shift increased soleus mus-
cle size, myogenic signaling, and preserved muscle strength in the face of HLS. We elected to partially
knockdown (-40-50%) both GSK3 isoforms despite the fact that only GSK3b was affected by spaceﬂight
to limit any potential compensatory activation of GSK3a. In a previous study by Pansters et al., sole genetic
deletion of Gsk3b appeared to have upregulated protein levels of GSK3a in the murine soleus.31 In this
study, the authors found that genetic knockdown of Gsk3b did not attenuate soleus muscle atrophy in
response to HLS, however, they did ﬁnd an acceleration in muscle recovery with reloading.31 These ﬁndings
are consistent with our present results showing that although muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 knockdown increased
soleus muscle size, it did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS, but it did enhance
myogenic signaling. Moreover, our ﬁndings extend those from Pansters et al. because they did not
examine soleus muscle contractile force. In this respect, GSK3mKD mice displayed greater force production
versus GSK3ﬂox mice but only after 7 days of HLS and not in the mobile state. This suggests that the effect of
GSK3mKD on muscle strength only manifests after an added stress such as HLS; and it further suggests that
in the face of HLS, GSK3mKD mice exhibit a preservation of muscle force production that could be important
for spaceﬂight.
The increase in myogenic signaling observed with GSK3mKD mice is also highly relevant to spaceﬂight.
Though HLS is considered to be the Earth-based analog of spaceﬂight, the mechanisms behind the
ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness with HLS versus actual spaceﬂight differ in many respects and there
is actually very little overlap.32 However, one common pathway that is negatively affected in both HLS and
spaceﬂight is myogenesis.32 Thus, the observed increase in myogenic signaling in GSK3mKD HLS mice
could potentially be translated to spaceﬂight; however, future studies that investigate the effects of space-
ﬂight directly on these mice are required if not warranted.
The GSK3mKD HLS mice also displayed a promotion toward the oxidative phenotype with a signiﬁcant
increase in MHC IIa, PGC-1a, and COXIV. This suggests that the inhibition of GSK3 not only attenuates
muscle atrophy and weakness but may also attenuate the slow-to-fast ﬁber type shift that could lead to dec-
rements in muscle performance and fatigue resistance. These results are not entirely surprising given that
we and others have shown that GSK3 inhibition in muscle can promote the oxidative ﬁber type and PGC-1a
content.24,25,33–36 Moreover, the increase in PGC-1a content in muscle can provide beneﬁts outside of mus-
cle by promoting the expression, production, and release of FNDC5 and irisin. Irisin is a myokine secreted
from muscle that can positively impact bone mass and strength even in the face of HLS.27,28,37 Speciﬁcally,
genetic deletion of irisin in mice severely compromises bone strength and mass with an increased number

of osteoclasts,27 whereas, irisin treatment prevented bone loss with HLS and accelerated bone recovery in
response to reloading in mice.28 Here, we show that muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 knockdown increased FNDC5
in muscle while also increasing BMD in the tibia and in the lumbar spine (though not statistically signiﬁcant
in the latter, p = 0.08). Combined with our results showing that GSK3b is overactive in bones (e.g., less
inhibitory Ser phosphorylation) from obtained mice subjected to spaceﬂight, our study provides ample ev-
idence in support of inhibiting GSK3 for the promotion of musculoskeletal health during spaceﬂight.
In human astronauts, the inhibition of GSK3 before and during spaceﬂight could be achieved with pharma-
cological inhibitors such as lithium (Li), which is an already FDA-approved drug. It is most commonly used
for the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, because Li also exerts adverse effects when taken at rela-
tively high doses (serum [Li] concentration exceeding 1.0 mM) for a prolonged period of time, it must be
prescribed within a narrow therapeutic range (0.5–1.0 mM serum concentration) (for review see ref. 38).
Conversely, we have shown that treating mice with lower doses of Li (serum [Li] of 0.02 mM) increases soleus
and EDL muscle speciﬁc force production while also promoting PGC-1a and the oxidative ﬁber type.25 In
cell culture, we have also shown that low dose Li supplementation augments myogenic differentiation and
fusion,29 which could have implications for spaceﬂight. In fact, pre-treating mice with a low dose of Li
(10 mg/kg/day via drinking water) for 4 weeks before unloading the soleus muscle via tenotomy, inhibited
GSK3 and increased soleus muscle size even in the face of tenotomy surgery (Figure S10). In addition to
muscle, Li has been shown to have osteoprotective effects.2,10,14–16 In a recent and large epidemiological
study, it was found that patients living with bipolar disorder and receiving Li treatment had reduced risk of
developing osteoporosis.39 This is consistent with our ﬁndings in mice whereby low dose Li supplementa-
tion augmented osteogenic signaling by inhibiting GSK3, which in turn activated the anabolic Wnt/b-cat-
enin pathway.10 It should be noted that Li has several osteoprotective effects acting on other pathways such
as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and bone morphogenetic protein-2

(BMP-2) transduction pathways (for review see40). Altogether, the results from our study warrant future in-
vestigations with spaceﬂight and/or HLS to examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of GSK3
before and during microgravity exposure to further establish whether targeting GSK3 can exert musculo-
skeletal protection against spaceﬂight. Undoubtedly, other GSK3 inhibitors aside from Li that are more
speciﬁc to GSK3 would be important to test and could include drugs like tideglusib, which is the most clin-
ically advanced GSK3 inhibitor currently being tested for other diseases and conditions.41,42 We have
recently shown that tideglusib treatment can preserve muscle size, strength, and quality in dystrophic
mice.24
The limitations of our study include low sample size, particularly with the RR1 and BION-M1 missions.
Although the RR1 mission was conducted in female mice, the limitation in sample size prevented us
from truly examining any potential inﬂuence of biological sex. Future studies, with age-matched male
and female mice, preferably part of the same mission, are required to better elucidate the potential sex-
speciﬁc effects of spaceﬂight on the musculoskeletal system. Our study was also limited in that we were
not able to obtain bone samples from all missions, and thus our analysis was restricted to the RR9 mission.
Within this mission, mCT analyses of the tibia indicated that cortical bone was primarily affected by space-
ﬂight. However, we suspect that limitations in sample size prevented us from detecting a statistically sig-
niﬁcant effect on trabecular bone. Indeed, previous mCT analyses in the lumbar vertebrae and femur
from the BION-M1 mission showed signiﬁcant reductions in trabecular bone outcomes in the F group
versus GC and VIV controls.43 In muscle, where we obtained samples from RR9, RR1, RR18, and BION-
M1 missions, we utilized a ‘‘meta-analytical’’ approach with the fold-change response as the common mea-
sure of effect size. However, differences in experimental conditions (i.e., food, temperature, pressure, strain
differences, age differences, and etc.) should not be discounted. These differences could have contributed
to the differences in phosphorylation status of GSK3, where we found signiﬁcant increases in Ser phosphor-
ylation of GSK3 in BION-M1 and RR18 F soleus muscles but not in any other soleus muscles from RR1 or RR9.
Finally, our study is limited in that we did not assess the effects of bone-speciﬁc Gsk3 deletion on BMD and
strength in response to HLS. Future studies should generate these mice and perform these experiments to
ﬁrmly establish whether GSK3 inhibition before simulated microgravity exposure can protect against bone
loss. Nevertheless, our ﬁndings demonstrate that inhibiting GSK3 speciﬁcally in muscle may exert positive
effects on the bone thereby highlighting a muscle-to-bone connection that would likely be activated with
whole-body GSK3 inhibition afforded through pharmacological means.
In summary, our study shows that GSK3 content and activation status are altered in murine soleus and bone
samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceﬂight. Although GSK3b content was reduced after space-
ﬂight, our results with the simulated microgravity HLS model shows that inhibiting GSK3 before muscle un-
loading via muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 deletion can increase muscle mass, myogenic signaling, and can preserve
muscle force production. Moreover, muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 deletion may also help to maintain bone mass by
increasing PGC-1a and FNDC5; and thus, future studies aboard the ISS are warranted to examine whether
these mice are protected against spaceﬂight-induced declines in musculoskeletal health. In addition,
future studies that examine the effects of pharmacological, and thus, whole-body GSK3 inhibition before
and during spaceﬂight should also be done in mice. Collectively, our present study represents an important
ﬁrst step in hopes of enabling longer duration spaceﬂight missions to Mars – possibly through GSK3
inhibition.

EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Muscle samples from RR1, RR9, RR18, and BION-M1 missions
Soleus, EDL, and TA muscle samples were obtained from the BION-M1 mission as well as the RR1, RR9, and
RR18 missions through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientiﬁc Collection Biospecimen
Sharing Program. For all missions, we were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed
in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on
Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions. For the BION-
M1 mission, male C57BL/6N (19–20 week old at time of launch) mice were maintained in high-orbit
(550 km) for 30 days in specialized ﬂight modules.44 For the NASA missions, male C57BL/6J (RR9 and
RR18, 10 weeks of age at time of launch) and female C57BL/6J (RR1, 16 weeks of age at time of launch)
mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats45
on board the International Space Station (ISS). Additional details on housing and tissue collection/prepa-
ration can be found elsewhere for RR1, RR9, and BION-M1.18,19 For the RR18 mission, ﬂight mice were
aboard the ISS for 30 days with weekly injections of either sterile saline (0.9%) or the antioxidant metallo-
porphyrin (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, herein referred to as BuOE). The mice used in this study were part of a live
animal return cohort where tissue dissection occurred 1 day after landing. Soleus muscles were collected
and stored in RNAlater at 80C, prior to being homogenized in PMSF buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 5 mM
HEPES, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2% NaN3 (pH 7.5)). We did not ﬁnd any differences in GSK3 content or MHC iso-
form expression between the two saline and BuOE cohorts, and thus we elected to keep them separate in
our analysis.
In addition to the F, GC, and VIV groups, we also received two cohort control groups from the RR9 mission.
Owing to Hurricane Irma (September 2017), the original RR9 GC and VIV experiments were terminated
early. GC and VIV experiments were replicated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice used for the ﬂight
experiment. With the new GC and VIV groups, an additional set of mice were used as cohort controls to

assess variation because of differences in time. That is, the mice originally dedicated to serve as the VIV
group in 2017 were labeled as cohort 1, and another set of age- and sex-matched mice were run as cohort
2 under similar treatments in 2018. Thus, differences in GSK3 expression and activation were ﬁrst examined
in R9 cohort controls to determine if a normalizing factor would be required. Importantly, we found no dif-
ferences in GSK3 phosphorylation in the TA muscles from Cohort Control 1 (CC1) and Cohort Control 2
(CC2) (Figure S12). We also found no signiﬁcant differences between cohort controls (CC1 vs. CC2) in
any of the bone outcomes measured (Table S3).
Animals
Skeletal muscle-speciﬁc Gsk3 partial knockdown mice of a C57BL/6J background were generated by
crossing GSK3a/b ﬂoxed mice (kindly donated by Dr. Virginia Lee, University of Pennsylvania) with
ACTA-1-Cre mice (Jackson laboratories) under the control of the skeletal muscle a-actin promoter.23 Het-
erozygously ﬂoxed GSK3a/b mice also heterozygously expressing ACTA-1 Cre were considered GSK3mKD,
whereas heterozygously ﬂoxed GSK3a/b mice without ACTA-1 Cre were considered the ﬂox control
(GSK3ﬂox). For the lithium feeding experiments, male 3–6 month old C57BL/6 mice were used. All mice
were fed a standard chow diet (2014 Teklad global, 14% protein rodent maintenance diet, Harlan Teklad,
Mississauga, ON), and were kept on a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water
through the entirety of the study. Mice were housed at a temperature of 22–24C for the duration of the
study.
Ethics statement
This study utilized murine muscle samples provided to us through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive
Institutional Scientiﬁc Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. All animal procedures performed were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for ﬂight at the NASA Ames
Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the methods were carried out in accor-
dance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Experimental protocols for the GSK3mKD and lithium
feeding experiments were approved by the Brock University Animal Care Committee (ﬁles #17-06-03,
#20-07-01, and #21-06-02) and were in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
METHOD DETAILS
Hindlimb suspension
For the hindlimb suspension (HLS) experiments, the hindlimbs of male GSK3mKD and GSK3ﬂox (4–6 month
old) mice were suspended using a taping method where the tails of mice were taped to a copper ring
attached to a steel bar that was mounted on top of a modiﬁed mouse cage. For these experiments,
mice were pair-housed in the cages and had as libitum access to food and water. After 7-day of HLS, all
mice were sacriﬁced via cervical dislocation (under isoﬂurane) and their soleus muscles were collected.
Lithium feeding and tenotomy surgery
For the lithium feeding study, C57BL/6 male mice (3–6 months of age) were randomly divided into a control
or lithium group. The lithium group received a dose of 10 mg/kg/day of LiCl via their drinking water as pre-
viously described10,23,25,46 whereas the control group received drinking water without LiCl supplementa-
tion. The total duration of treatment was 6 weeks. On the fourth week, all mice underwent the tenotomy
surgery as previously described.47–49 Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with vaporized isoﬂuorane, prior to
severing the soleus and gastrocnemius tendons from one leg. A sham surgery was conducted on the
contralateral leg to serve as an internal control. Both wounds on both legs were closed with silk suture
and mice were returned to their home cages, where LiCl or control treatment was maintained for an addi-
tional two weeks prior to euthanization. After euthanizing the mice via cervical dislocation, soleus muscles
were collected for future analyses.
DXA scanning of individual bones
A small animal DXA scanner (OsteoSys InSIGHT, Scintica) was used to scan the individual femur bones
collected from the RR9 mission. Overall coefﬁcient of variation of our analysis was 1.7% for BMD and
3.2% for BMC. In addition, we also performed region-speciﬁc BMD analysis for the tibia, femur, and lumbar
spine from mobile and HLS GSK3mKD and GSK3ﬂox mice.

Soleus muscle contractility
Soleus muscle contractility was assessed as previously described25,47 at 25C using an Aurora Scientiﬁc con-
tractile apparatus with a biphasic simulator (model 305B and 701B). Soleus muscles were subjected to a
force frequency curve (1, 20, 40, 80 and 160) with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.50 For force-frequency analysis,
peak isometric force was obtained. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated using the following formula:
CSA = m/l*d*(Lf/Lo), where m, muscle mass (mg); l, muscle length (mm); d, mammalian skeletal muscle den-
sity (1.06 mg/mm3); Lf/Lo is the ﬁber length-to-muscle length ratio (0.71 for soleus). Speciﬁc force was calcu-
lated by normalizing peak isometric force by CSA.
Western blotting
A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was used to determine sample protein concentration using an M2 Molec-
ular Devices Plate Reader (Molecular Devices). Western blotting was performed to determine GSK3b,
phosphorylated (p)-GSK3b, GSK3a, (p)-GSK3a, b catenin, MHC I, MHC IIa, MHC IIx, MHC IIb. Antibodies
from pGSK3b (9336), total (t)-GSK3-b (9315), pGSK3a (9316), tGSK3a (4818), b-Catenin (8480) were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). MHC I (BA-F8), IIa (SC-71), IIx (6H1), and IIb (BF-F3)
antibodies as well as the antibodies for Pax7 (AB_528428) and myogenin (F5D) were obtained from the
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). The antibodies for FNDC5 and COXIV
were obtained from Abcam (ab13190 and abS16056, respectively) and the antibody for PGC-1a was ob-
tained from Millipore (ST1204). All Western blots used BioRad TGX 4–15% gradient gels (4561086:
BioRad) and PVDF membranes. Samples were then prepped and equally loaded for gel electrophoresis.
Transfer was conducted via BioRad Transblot Turbo. Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5%
milk in TBST for 60 min or BioRad Every Blot blocking buffer (12010020) for 10 min. Following blocking,
the appropriate primary antibody was appropriately diluted and added during an overnight incubation
at 4C. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min
with TBST then incubated for 60 min with the analogous secondary anti-mouse (7076; Cell Signaling Tech-
nology; MHC I, IIa, IIx, IIb) or anti-rabbit (7074; Cell Signaling Technology; p-GSK3a, GSK3a p-GSK3b,
GSK3b, b-catenin) antibody both conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Upon secondary incubation,
membranes were washed another 3 times with TBST for 5-min each. Millipore Immobilon (#WBKLSO500)
chemiluminescent substrate was added and then visualized using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP for protein
detection. Ponceau staining was used for protein normalization (59803; Cell Signaling Technology).
GSK3 ﬁber type analysis
To assess the ﬁber type expression of GSK3b, we performed immunoﬂuorescent microscopy experiments
on serial 10 mm cryosections obtained from O.C.T. (optimal cutting temperature) embedded soleus and
EDL muscles from n = 3 mobile wild-type C57BL/6J male mice. One serial cryosection underwent immuno-
ﬂuorescent ﬁber type staining as previously described to demarcate the various ﬁber types with MHC I, IIa,
IIx, and IIb isoforms.30,47 The other serial cryosection underwent immunoﬂuorescent staining with a primary
antibody for GSK3b (9315, Cell Signaling, 1:2500 dilution) and an anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 ﬂuorescent
secondary antibody (A27040, ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, 1:5000 dilution). Once ﬁber types were identiﬁed
with MHC isoform expression/ﬂuorescence, GSK3b was quantiﬁed by converting the image to grayscale
and quantifying the mean gray value with ImageJ. Within a single muscle, 10 of each ﬁber type were
randomly analyzed.
Histological analysis
Soleus muscles embedded in O.C.T. matrix from GSK3mKD and GSK3ﬂox HLS mice were processed into
10 mm cryosections prior to undergoing H&E staining. For each muscle, 2–3 images were randomly taken
and the CSA of 20 ﬁbers per mouse (n = 3–4 per group) were obtained using ImageJ. For central nuclei
counts, the total number of ﬁbers from the H&E images were counted, ranging from 150 to 230 ﬁbers
per image and the number of ﬁbers with central nuclei calculated as a percent of the total number of ﬁbers
within the image.
Micro-computed tomography bone imaging
Micro-computed tomography (mCT, SkyScan 1176 V.1.1 build 12, Bruker microCT, Belgium) was performed
as previously described.51 Following euthanasia, the right tibia was excised, cleaned of surrounding tissue,
and wrapped in paraﬁlm wax to prevent moisture loss throughout the duration of the 180-degree high res-
olution (9 mm) scan. A 0.25 mm aluminum ﬁlter was applied. The beam strength was set at 45 kV and 545 mA

for an exposure time of 850 ms. Resulting images were reconstructed (smoothing kernel = 2, ring artifact
reduction = 8, beam hardening = 30%, and dynamic image range = 0.000–0.155; NRecon V.1.7.3.1 soft-
ware, Bruker microCT, Belgium) into 3D images and reoriented in anatomical position (DataViewer
V.1.5.6.2 64-bit software, Bruker microCT, Belgium) for consistency when selecting the regions of interest.
Quantiﬁcation of trabecular and cortical bone structure outcomes was performed at the proximal tibia and
tibia midpoint, respectively.
Assessment of trabecular bone structure at the proximal tibia
Trabecular bone region of interest began 0.855 mm from the point in which the primary spongiosa discon-
nects and formation of the growth plate is evident and expanded 0.675 mm toward the tibia midpoint.
Trabecular bone was manually delineated from the cortical bone and quantiﬁed using an adaptive thresh-
olding of 49 to determine total volume, bone volume, bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, trabec-
ular separation, trabecular number, degree of anisotropy, and connectivity density.
Assessment of cortical bone structure at the tibia midpoint
For cortical bone structure analysis, the tibia midpoint was used to deﬁne the region of interest (0.450 mm
toward the proximal and distal ends; total height of 0.900 mm). Cortical bone structure outcomes, including
total cross-sectional area, cortical area, cortical area fraction, cortical thickness, periosteal perimeter, en-
docortical perimeter, medullary area, and eccentricity, were calculated using an adaptive threshold of 67.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses
To examine the combined effect of spaceﬂight on GSK3 content and phosphorylation, fold-change values
were calculated for each mission relative to the average of both GC and VIV controls. The fold-change
values were compared with GCVIV controls using a Student’s t test. For the western blot data across the
individual experiments (Figures S1–S3, S5, and S6), a one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal Wallis
test with a Dunnet’s post-hoc test was used to strictly compare GC vs. Flight and VIV vs. Flight. This method
was chosen since no signiﬁcant differences between GC and VIV for any outcome measure related to mus-
cle were detected for any mission. Similarly, for the bone analysis (DXA, mCT, and western blot analyses) GC
and VIV controls were combined as there were no differences between the two groups. This was done to
increase statistical power. A Student’s t test was then used to make comparisons between F and GCVIV. For
the GSK3mKD experiments, most comparisons were made Student’s t test unless otherwise stated where a
two-way ANOVA was used. For the lithium and tenotomy experiments, a two-way ANOVA was also used to
test the main effects of lithium treatment and tenotomy. All data are presented as mean +/ standard error
unless stated otherwise. A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality for both studies. Statistical tests
were conducted through GraphPad Prism 8 Software. Any statistical outliers detected using the ROUT test
(Q = 5%) on GraphPad Prism were removed prior to analysis. A p % 0.05 was used to determine statistical
signiﬁcance.
